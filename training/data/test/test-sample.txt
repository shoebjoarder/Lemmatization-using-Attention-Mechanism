Now if this is one s view of property rights then the justification of a system of property rights must tie property rights to the act of producing	now if this be one s view of property right then the justification of a system of property right must tie property right to the act of produce
In some way or another that is it must be the case that the system of property fights generally provides producers	in some way or another that is it must be the case that the system of property fight generally provide producer
So on such accounts the case for a system of property rights will seek to demonstrate two things that a system of private property provides producers with control over the fruits of their labor and that an institution which establishes such a tie is justified	so on such account the case for a system of property right will seek to demonstrate two thing that a system of private property provide producer with control over the fruit of their labor and that a institution which establish such a tie be justify
Both are required for the success of the Millian case for private property	both be require for the success of the millian case for private property
A socialist for instance might accept but deny indeed it has been a common enough socialist complaint that a system of private property is a barrier to providing producers with control over the fruits of their labor	a socialist for instance might accept but deny indeed it have be a common enough socialist complaint that a system of private property be a barrier to provide producer with control over the fruit of their labor
Consider that is a critic who denies that there is any reason to accept an institution that grants producers such special control	consider that is a critic who deny that there be any reason to accept a institution that grant producer such special control
In such a state of nature we could focus on the claims that production generates without being distracted by preexisting claims over things	in such a state of nature we could focus on the claim that production generate without be distract by preexisting claim over thing

That labour put a distinction between them and common	that labor put a distinction between them and common
That added something to them more than Nature the common Mother of all had done and so they became his private right 	that add something to them more than nature the common mother of all have do and so they become his private right 
The suggestion then is that the continuing influence of and thus emphasize the tie between labor andor production and the claim to control the fruits of labor	the suggestion then be that the continuing influence of and thus emphasize the tie between labor andor production and the claim to control the fruit of labor
So understood an original acquisition account of property need be no more historical than a political theory based on the concepts of the state of nature or the social contract	so understand a original acquisition account of property need be no more historical than a political theory base on the concept of the state of nature or the social contract
Although all three concepts appear to display a historical dimension and were probably understood by their early exponents as at least partially historical their contemporary appeal is not historical	although all three concept appear to display a historical dimension and be probably understand by their early exponent as at least partially historical their contemporary appeal be not historical
Rather all three ie original acquisition the state of nature and the social contract are thought experiments that induce us to view justificatory	rather all three ie original acquisition the state of nature and the social contract be think experiment that induce us to view justificatory
To be sure this probably was not Locke s intent	to be sure this probably be not locke s intent

As we said a Millian account of property rights must justify two claims that a system of private property provides producers with control over the fruits of the such a tie is justified	as we say a millian account of property right must justify two claim that a system of private property provide producer with control over the fruit of the such a tie be justify
We have suggested that one way and the most interesting way an original acquisition tale functions is to justify the claim that workers deserve the fruits of their labor	we have suggest that one way and the most interesting way a original acquisition tale function be to justify the claim that worker deserve the fruit of their labor
But it is precisely here that original acquisition accounts of property seem to confront a justificatory challenge that distinguishes them from arguments for other liberal rights	but it be precisely here that original acquisition account of property seem to confront a justificatory challenge that distinguish them from argument for other liberal right

One does not have to do anything to earn such rights indeed that is one of the points of insisting that they are universal rights	one do not have to do anything to earn such right indeed that be one of the point of insist that they be universal right
The question thus arises how are Thetaers to justify their claims to nonThetaers	the question thus arise how be thetaers to justify their claim to nonthetaers
Perhaps Thetaers can show all others that everyone Thetaers and nonThetaers alike accept the appropriateness of giving say workers control over the fruits of their labors Or alternatively it might be shown that even nonThetaers benefit from a system that allows Thetaers special claims over resources	perhaps thetaers can show all others that everyone thetaers and nonthetaers alike accept the appropriateness of give say worker control over the fruit of their labors or alternatively it might be show that even nonthetaers benefit from a system that allow thetaers special claim over resource
This we take it is one interpretation of Locke s famous claim echoed by Adam Smith that a King of a large and fruitful Territory in America where individual appropriation of land had not commenced feeds lodges and is clad worse than a day labourer in England	this we take it be one interpretation of locke s famous claim echo by adam smith that a king of a large and fruitful territory in america where individual appropriation of land have not commenced feed lodge and be clad bad than a day labourer in england
 The day to whom a property holder must justify himself the day laborer apparently does not obtain benefits from the system of private property	 the day to whom a property holder must justify himself the day laborer apparently do not obtain benefit from the system of private property
But if Locke and Smith are correct he does obtain benefits he the worst of in a society with private property is better off than the bestoff person in a state without appropriation	but if locke and smith be correct he do obtain benefit he the bad of in a society with private property be better off than the bestoff person in a state without appropriation
If so that does seem to be a reasonable if not conclusive justification of private property	if so that do seem to be a reasonable if not conclusive justification of private property
Thus it seems that arguments making say production the grounds of property rights do indeed face a special justificatory problem they must justify the system of property rights to those uninterested in or unable to perform the relevant activity	thus it seem that argument make say production the ground of property right do indeed face a special justificatory problem they must justify the system of property right to those uninterested in or unable to perform the relevant activity
This we suspect is the worry behind Gibbard s insistence on consent perhaps the producers need to obtain the consent of the nonproducers	this we suspect be the worry behind gibbard s insistence on consent perhaps the producer need to obtain the consent of the nonproducer
And it is probably at the root of the unilateral feature of property claims that so troubles Waldron why should producers be able unilaterally to put nonproducers under obligations But the real problem rights of Thetaers to property must be justified to all on whom they impose moral demands	and it be probably at the root of the unilateral feature of property claim that so trouble waldron why should producer be able unilaterally to put nonproducer under obligation but the real problem right of thetaers to property must be justify to all on whom they impose moral demand
Do property rights pose a special justificatory problem We have argued in this paper that for the most part they do not	do property right pose a special justificatory problem we have argue in this paper that for the most part they do not
Most of the socalled special problems of property are simply particular cases of the general requirement that claim rights be justified to those on whom they impose obligations	most of the socalled special problem of property be simply particular case of the general requirement that claim right be justify to those on whom they impose obligation
We have shown that critics of liberal property rights typically hold these rights to be dubious because they stand in need of justification though these same critics elsewhere in relation say to free speech accept an equivalent justificatory requirement as unproblematic	we have show that critic of liberal property right typically hold these right to be dubious because they stand in need of justification though these same critic elsewhere in relation say to free speech accept a equivalent justificatory requirement as unproblematic

So whether property can be justified apparenty depends on whether original approprition can be justified	so whether property can be justified apparenty depend on whether original approprition can be justify
Under what conditions then can removing natural resources from the commons be justified The standard answer is John Locke s	under what condition then can remove natural resource from the commons be justify the standard answer be john locke s
Labour being the unquestionable Property of the Labourer no Man but he can have a right to what that is once joyned to at least where there is enough and as good left in common for others	labor be the unquestionable property of the labourer no man but he can have a right to what that be once joyned to at least where there be enough and as good left in common for others
So the way to remove resources from the common stock is to mix one s labor with them thereby annexing them to one s person	so the way to remove resource from the common stock be to mix one s labor with them thereby annex them to one s person
A problematic idea to be sure but what interests me is how Locke qualifies it however one goes about removing goods from the commons one only unequivocally establishes title to those goods if one s	a problematic idea to be sure but what interest me be how locke qualify it however one go about remove good from the commons one only unequivocally establish title to those good if one s
This qualification upon what one can originally extract from the commons is now known as the Lockean Proviso	this qualification upon what one can originally extract from the commons be now know as the lockean proviso
Virtually no one to my knowledge believes that any particular act of initial appropriation in a world of scarcity stands much chance of satisfying the Lockean Proviso Judith Jarvis Thomson once put it this way	virtually no one to my knowledge believe that any particular act of initial appropriation in a world of scarcity stand much chance of satisfy the lockean proviso judith jarvis thomson once put it this way
I suspect that there is no plausible construal of what Locke had in mind by enough and as good under which anyone s taking land for himself would leave enough and as good for all the other owners	i suspect that there be no plausible construal of what locke have in mind by enough and as good under which anyone be take land for himself would leave enough and as good for all the other owner
For one thing Locke did not realize how large the class of owners was going to be	for one thing locke do not realize how large the class of owner be go to be
I therefore suspect that if we take leaving enough and as good as a necessary condition for property acquisition then it will follow that there can be no private ownership of land 	i therefore suspect that if we take leave enough and as good as a necessary condition for property acquisition then it will follow that there can be no private ownership of land 
Likewise Rolf Sartorious says this Understood as an original limitation on the right to appropriate natural resources the condition that there be enough and as good left for others could not of course be literally satisfied by any system of private property rights	likewise rolf sartorious say this understand as a original limitation on the right to appropriate natural resource the condition that there be enough and as good left for others could not of course be literally satisfy by any system of private property right
We compound the problem as John T Sanders explains if we suppose quite reasonably that the Proviso requires us to leave something for our children as well as for each other	we compound the problem as john t sanders explain if we suppose quite reasonably that the proviso require us to leave something for our child as well as for each other
In particular if you consider all future generations and if you must leave enough and as good for every future human being then it is hard to imagine that the Proviso would allow you to mix your labor with much more than an infinitesimal slice of land	in particular if you consider all future generation and if you must leave enough and as good for every future human being then it be hard to imagine that the proviso would allow you to mix your labor with much more than a infinitesimal slice of land

John Arthur adds that if one approaches the problem of resource acquisition from the perspective of the Lockean proviso that enough and as good must be left in common then the typical method of acquiring property under capitalism is unjust	john arthur add that if one approach the problem of resource acquisition from the perspective of the lockean proviso that enough and as good must be leave in common then the typical method of acquire property under capitalism be unjust
If Arthur is right the implications are farreaching indeed	if arthur be right the implication be farreaching indeed

If private property falls to the objection that original appropriation can not be justified it falls as a method of restricting access to the commons and all methods of restricting access to the commons fall along with it	if private property fall to the objection that original appropriation can not be justify it fall as a method of restrict access to the commons and all method of restrict access to the commons fall along with it
Unless we are willing to admit that no such institutions can be legitimate we seem forced to dismiss the Proviso as at best a sufficient but not necessary condition on appropriation that being impossible to satisfy should be ignored	unless we be willing to admit that no such institution can be legitimate we seem force to dismiss the proviso as at best a sufficient but not necessary condition on appropriation that be impossible to satisfy should be ignore
Indeed Sanders has a powerful argument that ignoring it is exactly what we should do 	indeed sanders have a powerful argument that ignore it be exactly what we should do 
Against the idea that we should ignore the Proviso consider that in proposing the Proviso Locke is already retreating from the usual criterion of legitimate property transfer which requires that transactions be consensual	against the idea that we should ignore the proviso consider that in propose the proviso locke be already retreat from the usual criteria of legitimate property transfer which require that transaction be consensual
The retreat is necessary because a wouldbe original appropriator can not obtain the prior consent of previous owners before are no previous owners	the retreat be necessary because a wouldbe original appropriator can not obtain the prior consent of previous owner before be no previous owner
Nor does anyone have the kind of claim to the resource that prior owners would have so there is no reason to suppose that anything as strong as prior consent is normatively required to legitimize original appropriation	nor do anyone have the kind of claim to the resource that prior owner would have so there be no reason to suppose that anything as strong as prior consent be normatively require to legitimize original appropriation
Yet Locke was right to think something must be done to justify original appropriation for such appropriation seizes exclusive control over that to which others previously had unrestricted access	yet locke be right to think something must be do to justify original appropriation for such appropriation seize exclusive control over that to which others previously have unrestricted access
Especially under conditions of scarcity such seizures have to be justified	especially under condition of scarcity such seizure have to be justify
Locke is also basically on target in specifying the nature of the required justification that is one should not appropriate goods from the commons without stopping to consider what one is leaving for others	locke be also basically on target in specify the nature of the required justification that is one should not appropriate good from the commons without stop to consider what one be leave for others
Robert Nozick agrees saying that any adequate theory of justice in acquisition will contain something like the Proviso The trouble is as J H Bogart says under conditions of scarcity every acquisition worsens the lot of others and worsens their lot in relevant ways	robert nozick agree say that any adequate theory of justice in acquisition will contain something like the proviso the trouble be as xxj h bogart say under condition of scarcity every acquisition worsen the lot of others and worsen their lot in relevant way
 The problem with the Proviso is that contrary than the requirement that one obtain the prior consent of others	 the problem with the proviso be that contrary than the requirement that one obtain the prior consent of others
Both appear to be tests that original appropriation can not possibly pass	both appear to be test that original appropriation can not possibly pass
Suppose it really is necessary for original appropriation to satisfy the Proviso	suppose it really be necessary for original appropriation to satisfy the proviso
Would justifying original appropriation be possible I think so	would justifying original appropriation be possible i think so
Moreover I do not think it becomes harder for original appropriation to satisfy the Proviso as goods become more scarce	moreover i do not think it become hard for original appropriation to satisfy the proviso as good become more scarce
In fact I will argue that far from never permitting us to remove goods from the commons the Proviso may sometimes require us to remove scarce goods from the commons	in fact i will argue that far from never permit us to remove good from the commons the proviso may sometimes require us to remove scarce good from the commons
I do not claim that Locke himself intended the Proviso to be read as I will read it	i do not claim that locke himself intend the proviso to be read as i will read it

The essence of the Tragedy of the Commons what makes it tragic is precisely that not enough and as good is left for others	the essence of the tragedy of the commons what make it tragic be precisely that not enough and as good be leave for others
As a necessary condition for satisfying the Proviso goods must be removed from the commons	as a necessary condition for satisfy the proviso good must be remove from the commons
Moreover the more severe the scarcity the faster resources will be destroyed in will require that resources be removed from the commons	moreover the more severe the scarcity the faster resource will be destroy in will require that resource be remove from the commons
Needless to say there is more than one institutional framework that can effectively remove goods from the commons ranging from private property to public property to national borders	needless to say there be more than one institutional framework that can effectively remove good from the commons range from private property to public property to national border

We could satisfy the Proviso by choosing for everyone to abide by principles ourselves not for everyone	we could satisfy the proviso by choose for everyone to abide by principle ourselves not for everyone
And what people should choose for themselves differs from what would be right and from what the Proviso would require if they were choosing for everyone	and what people should choose for themselves differ from what would be right and from what the proviso would require if they be choose for everyone
To decide that everyone will leave a piece of land alone would be to protect it to decide to leave it alone oneself is merely to leave it unprotected	to decide that everyone will leave a piece of land alone would be to protect it to decide to leave it alone oneself be merely to leave it unprotected

But whether their actions are right or wrong is not really the point	but whether their action be right or wrong be not really the point
The point is that until access to the land is restricted people will have the opportunity and the incentive to overuse it and some of them as a matter of fact will overuse it thereby not leaving enough and as good for others	the point be that until access to the land be restrict people will have the opportunity and the incentive to overuse it and some of them as a matter of fact will overuse it thereby not leave enough and as good for others
A moral agent has to take this into account when deciding how to go about ensuring that there will be something left for her children	a moral agent have to take this into account when decide how to go about ensure that there will be something leave for her child

If one is to satisfy the Proviso in a way that has some positive bearing on the preservation of mankind one as it applies to things like apples ie food	if one be to satisfy the proviso in a way that have some positive bearing on the preservation of mankind one as it apply to thing like apple ie food
But if one merely appropriates apples one is not satisfying the Proviso with respect to apples	but if one merely appropriate apple one be not satisfy the proviso with respect to apple
Those who appropriate apples from the commons violate the Proviso on any interpretation of it insofar as it pertains to apples	those who appropriate apple from the commons violate the proviso on any interpretation of it insofar as it pertain to apple
They generate the tragedy of the commons	they generate the tragedy of the commons
Since appropriating apples ignores the Proviso with respect to apples the tragedy created by those who appropriate apples alters what the Proviso means as a constraint on appropriations of land	since appropriate apple ignore the proviso with respect to apple the tragedy create by those who appropriate apple alter what the proviso mean as a constraint on appropriation of land
In other words some alteration of the rules of access to apples is necessary if the Proviso with respect to apples is to be satisfied	in other word some alteration of the rule of access to apple be necessary if the proviso with respect to apple be to be satisfy
The Proviso itself drives us to make this alteration and so our interpretation of the Proviso must reflect the fact that it drives us to alter the rules of access to apples ie to restrict access to apples	the proviso itself drive us to make this alteration and so our interpretation of the proviso must reflect the fact that it drive us to alter the rule of access to apple ie to restrict access to apple
Specifically to appropriate land is to restrict access to apples	specifically to appropriate land be to restrict access to apple
And restricted access to apples tends somewhat paradoxically to be a precondition Proviso with respect to apples one must appropriate land rather than apples	and restricted access to apple tend somewhat paradoxically to be a precondition proviso with respect to apple one must appropriate land rather than apple
Hence land appropriation is not a violation of the Proviso given that the Proviso applies first and foremost to food under those circumstances but must instead be required by it	hence land appropriation be not a violation of the proviso given that the proviso apply first and foremost to food under those circumstance but must instead be require by it
I will say more about the Proviso with respect to land at the end of the following section	i will say more about the proviso with respect to land at the end of the following section
Two assumptions I made in deriving this conclusion are worth discussing	two assumption i make in derive this conclusion be worth discuss
First in requiring that enough and as good be left for others I take the Proviso to be referring to future generations as well as to the present one	first in require that enough and as good be leave for others i take the proviso to be refer to future generation as well as to the present one
As Sanders puts it What possible argument could at the same time require that the present generation have scruples about leaving enough for one another while shrugging off such concern for future generations 	as sanders put it what possible argument could at the same time require that the present generation have scruple about leave enough for one another while shrug off such concern for future generation 
Locke thought the point of property was that it helped preserve mankind which he undoubtedly meant to include future generations	locke think the point of property be that it help preserve mankind which he undoubtedly mean to include future generation
This does not mean Locke also intended the Proviso s reference to the suggestion is surely a strong one	this do not mean locke also intend the proviso s reference to the suggestion be surely a strong one
Moreover if Locke did not think of the Proviso as protecting future generations he should have and so should we	moreover if locke do not think of the proviso as protect future generation he should have and so should we
If we aspire to preserve mankind leaving something for our own generation is not enough	if we aspire to preserve mankind leave something for our own generation be not enough
The land must be saved for future generations too	the land must be save for future generation too

 In virtue of its endorsement of selfownership classical liberalism operates with a strong presumption against any doctrine that asserts or implies that some people have natural rights to the products of other people s efforts and endeavors	 in virtue of its endorsement of selfownership classical liberalism operate with a strong presumption against any doctrine that assert or imply that some people have natural right to the product of other people s effort and endeavor

SelfOwnership and Act Theories of Private Property	selfownership and act theory of private property
In the course of characterizing feature of classical liberalism I have cited two alternative conceptions of the basis of private entitlements in extrapersonal objects	in the course of characterize feature of classical liberalism i have cite two alternative conception of the basis of private entitlement in extrapersonal object
According to one these entitlements arise simply through various exercises of selfownership while according to the other conception these entitlements arise through actions in accordance with the rules and procedures defining a practice of companion to the natural right of persons over themselves	according to one these entitlement arise simply through various exercise of selfownership while according to the other conception these entitlement arise through action in accordance with the rule and procedure define a practice of companion to the natural right of person over themselves
One might then proceed in terms of a distinction between the SelfOwnership Exercise theory and the SelfOwnership Companion theory	one might then proceed in terms of a distinction between the selfownership exercise theory and the selfownership companion theory

The second reason is to begin to build the case for going beyond Acts theories to the Practice theory which asserts that there must be within classical liberalism a distinct natural right of property which supplements selfownership	the second reason be to begin to build the case for go beyond act theory to the practice theory which assert that there must be within classical liberalism a distinct natural right of property which supplement selfownership

Each present rightholder exercises his selfownership in a certain way and this exercise extends his moral jurisdiction over some extrapersonal object	each present rightholder exercise his selfownership in a certain way and this exercise extend his moral jurisdiction over some extrapersonal object
The agent s moral jurisdiction is extended by his action because his action extends the agent s vulnerability to the violation of his selfownership	the agent s moral jurisdiction be extend by his action because his action extend the agent s vulnerability to the violation of his selfownership
Each such entitlement is subject to a separate and selfcontained vindication	each such entitlement be subject to a separate and selfcontained vindication
The paradigmatic version of the Act approach is the Lockean labor theory of property or more specifically the Lockean labor theory of just initial acquisition with respect to extrapersonal property is ascribed to all persons	the paradigmatic version of the act approach be the lockean labor theory of property or more specifically the lockean labor theory of just initial acquisition with respect to extrapersonal property be ascribe to all person
In the Lockean case of course it is the right of each to his own labor which itself is an implication of each person s selfpropriety	in the lockean case of course it be the right of each to his own labor which itself be a implication of each person s selfpropriety
This internal right provides or is supposed to provide a conduit for individual right to enter the external world	this internal right provide or be supposed to provide a conduit for individual right to enter the external world
In the Lockean paradigm an individual may exercise his right over his own labor and thereby mix his labor with extrapersonal material	in the lockean paradigm a individual may exercise his right over his own labor and thereby mix his labor with extrapersonal material
Since the labor is invested and not merely dissipated the resulting transformed object now contains something the agent s labor which is still morally attached to the agent	since the labor be invest and not merely dissipate the resulting transformed object now contain something the agent s labor which be still morally attach to the agent
For others now to seize this object would be for them to seize the labor that has been mixed with it	for others now to seize this object would be for them to seize the labor that have be mix with it

Much less is said by Act Theorists about nonoriginal private property rights ie about rights arising through or being conveyed by voluntary transfer	much less be say by act theorist about nonoriginal private property right ie about right arise through or be convey by voluntary transfer

Exchange transmits investment from the object surrendered to the object thereby purchased	exchange transmit investment from the object surrender to the object thereby purchase
In the case of a liberty reenactment doctrine the claim will simply be that an exchange constitutes a permissible substitution of objects in use in ongoing projects and that the project itself may be the achievement of advantageous ie valueenhancing substitutions	in the case of a liberty reenactment doctrine the claim will simply be that a exchange constitute a permissible substitution of object in use in ongoing project and that the project itself may be the achievement of advantageous ie valueenhancing substitution

And once it is it is eminently plausible to maintain that the person who seizes the transformed material expropriates the human capital of the investor and thereby engages in an action on a moral par with the direct seizure involved in forced labor	and once it be it be eminently plausible to maintain that the person who seize the transformed material expropriate the human capital of the investor and thereby engage in a action on a moral par with the direct seizure involved in forced labor

In his book Morals by Agreement David Gauthier offers a stateofnature justification for a form of ownership which he believes closely resembles private ownership Gauthier argues that first appropriation of land within certain restrictions morally justifies vesting in the appropriator rights resembling private ownership	in his book moral by agreement david gauthier offer a stateofnature justification for a form of ownership which he believe closely resemble private ownership gauthier argue that first appropriation of land within certain restriction morally justify vest in the appropriator right resemble private ownership

I have argued that all stateofnature justifications by first appropriation must fail because they presuppose unrealistic conditions and are questionbegging	i have argue that all stateofnature justification by first appropriation must fail because they presuppose unrealistic condition and be questionbegging

Any moral justification of a form of ownership grounded upon an original act of appropriation in a state of nature must show not only that the particular form is thus grounded but also that no other form can be so grounded	any moral justification of a form of ownership ground upon a original act of appropriation in a state of nature must show not only that the particular form be thus ground but also that no other form can be so ground
Using private ownership as an example it is not sufficient to show that private ownership can be grounded on original appropriation in a state of nature the argument must also show that no other form of ownership such as communal ownership can also fulfill the relevant standard of justification	use private ownership as a example it be not sufficient to show that private ownership can be ground on original appropriation in a state of nature the argument must also show that no other form of ownership such as communal ownership can also fulfill the relevant standard of justification
Let me explain more fully what I mean because this point is almost universally ignored	let me explain more fully what i mean because this point be almost universally ignore
Suppose that a Gauthier or a Locke tries to prove that private ownership based upon original private appropriation produces more utility or benefit to each individual than the state of nature in which land and resources in effect constitute a commons available to all	suppose that a gauthier or a locke try to prove that private ownership base upon original private appropriation produce more utility or benefit to each individual than the state of nature in which land and resource in effect constitute a commons available to all
While this argument may seem to justify private ownership the argument does not show that only private ownership is morally justified	while this argument may seem to justify private ownership the argument do not show that only private ownership be morally justify
There may be other forms of ownership also produce more utility or benefit than a state of nature in which land and resources are a commons available to all	there may be other form of ownership also produce more utility or benefit than a state of nature in which land and resource be a commons available to all
If the standard of justification is the production of greater benefit or utility for each than the stateofnature commons then private ownership private usufruct and collective cooperative ownership may be morally justified	if the standard of justification be the production of great benefit or utility for each than the stateofnature commons then private ownership private usufruct and collective cooperative ownership may be morally justify
The problem is that this stateofnature justification shows all three to be justified which means that this stateofnature argument can not be used to decide which of the three is morally preferable	the problem be that this stateofnature justification show all three to be justify which mean that this stateofnature argument can not be use to decide which of the three be morally preferable
A complete justification would have to show that private ownership and only private ownership fulfills the standard of justification	a complete justification would have to show that private ownership and only private ownership fulfill the standard of justification
Other forms of ownership must therefore be examined and shown not to fulfill the standards	other form of ownership must therefore be examine and show not to fulfill the standard
Arguments which show that private ownership or any other form is grounded upon original appropriation but which fail to show that only private ownership or some other form is so grounded I shall call partial justifications	argument which show that private ownership or any other form be ground upon original appropriation but which fail to show that only private ownership or some other form be so ground i shall call partial justification
This distinction between partial and complete justifications is different from and independent of the distinction between what is justification of ownership might conclude that one specific form and only one specific form of ownership is morally justified and thus morally required	this distinction between partial and complete justification be different from and independent of the distinction between what be justification of ownership might conclude that one specific form and only one specific form of ownership be morally justify and thus morally require
By contrast moral justification of ownership might conclude that several closely related forms of ownership are all morally permissible and that no one of them is morally required	by contrast moral justification of ownership might conclude that several closely related form of ownership be all morally permissible and that no one of them be morally require
Adopting any one of the closely related forms would be right	adopt any one of the closely related form would be right
Forms of ownership would not be closely related in this sense if vesting the right were morally permissible and withholding it were not	form of ownership would not be closely relate in this sense if vest the right be morally permissible and withhold it be not
A complete justification of ownership would have to argue that these closely related forms and only these closely related forms fulfill the justificatory requirements	a complete justification of ownership would have to argue that these closely related form and only these closely related form fulfill the justificatory requirement
If the argument demonstrates that the closely related forms fulfill the justificatory requirements without also demonstrating that other unrelated forms fail to fulfill the requirements then the justification is only partial	if the argument demonstrate that the closely related form fulfill the justificatory requirement without also demonstrate that other unrelated form fail to fulfill the requirement then the justification be only partial
Any argument which grounds a specific form of ownership upon some justificatory requirement without explaining why other forms can not be similarly grounded fails to provide a complete justification and may also fail to provide reasons for judging whether the form of ownership is morally permissible or morally required	any argument which ground a specific form of ownership upon some justificatory requirement without explain why other form can not be similarly ground fail to provide a complete justification and may also fail to provide reason for judge whether the form of ownership be morally permissible or morally require
Gauthier as well as Locke Kant and Nozick offers only a partial justification of private ownership	gauthier as well as locke kant and nozick offer only a partial justification of private ownership
Not only does Gauthier never consider the possibility that other forms of ownership might have the same results as private ownership but indeed there are other forms of ownership which do have the same result	not only do gauthier never consider the possibility that other form of ownership might have the same result as private ownership but indeed there be other form of ownership which do have the same result
That is integral to his method as he sees it	that be integral to his method as he see it

Each presupposes some additional criterion of title which would originally distribute legitimate title over things so that individuals could then transfer title by gift bequest or exchange	each presuppose some additional criteria of title which would originally distribute legitimate title over thing so that individual could then transfer title by gift bequest or exchange
Social contract theorists have solved the problem of original distribution in two different ways	social contract theorist have solve the problem of original distribution in two different way
Some have made the distribution prior to the contract while others have made the distribution part of the contract	some have make the distribution prior to the contract while others have make the distribution part of the contract
Rawls and Hobbes make the distribution a result of the social contract	rawls and hobbes make the distribution a result of the social contract
In the Leviathan Hobbes s contract empowers the sovereign to make original distribution as well as to make the rules governing subsequent transfers Rawls makes the communal ownership of talents and abilities part of the contract	in the leviathan hobbes s contract empower the sovereign to make original distribution as well as to make the rule govern subsequent transfers rawls make the communal ownership of talent and ability part of the contract
By contrast Hume and Locke locate the original distribution in what exist prior to the convention or contract	by contrast hume and locke locate the original distribution in what exist prior to the convention or contract
For Hume present possession at the time of the convention is the natural expedient for making the original labor on what is unowned as the criterion for his initial distribution	for hume present possession at the time of the convention be the natural expedient for make the original labor on what be unowned as the criteria for his initial distribution
Gauthier like Hume and Locke adopts the precontract rather than the contractdependent methodology	gauthier like hume and locke adopt the precontract rather than the contractdependent methodology
Gauthier s justification of private ownership rests upon the following illustration	gauthier s justification of private ownership rest upon the following illustration

Use is in dividual each family provides primarily for its own needs and interaction is noncooperative	use be in dividual each family provide primarily for its own need and interaction be noncooperative
Suppose that Eve the head of one of the families is aware that planned intensive cultivation would make the land more productive so that she proposes to take a certain area of the island for her exclusive use in order that her family may benefit by maximizing its productivity	suppose that eve the head of one of the family be aware that plan intensive cultivation would make the land more productive so that she propose to take a certain area of the island for her exclusive use in order that her family may benefit by maximize its productivity
She seeks therefore an exclusive right to a certain portion of the island	she seek therefore a exclusive right to a certain portion of the island
Eve seeks the security of tenure which market compensation rather than full compensation confers	eve seek the security of tenure which market compensation rather than full compensation confer
Full compensation according to Gauthier is compensation which leaves a person without any net loss in utility	full compensation according to gauthier be compensation which leave a person without any net loss in utility
Eve seeks the more comprehensive protection which a right in the product of her labor would realize Eve intends to better her family s situation through a system of rights that determine her endowment for prospective market and cooperative interaction	eve seek the more comprehensive protection which a right in the product of her labor would realize eve intend to better her family s situation through a system of right that determine her endowment for prospective market and cooperative interaction
Gauthier argues that Eve s appropriation need not be brought about by worsening the situation of the other islanders	gauthier argue that eve s appropriation need not be bring about by worsen the situation of the other islander
While Eve might seek to appropriate a toolarge portion of the island which would violate the Lockean proviso against worsening the situation of others there might be sufficiently abundant land such that she need not worsen the situation of others	while eve might seek to appropriate a toolarge portion of the island which would violate the lockean proviso against worsen the situation of others there might be sufficiently abundant land such that she need not worsen the situation of others
Eve s appropriation might be small enough and her increased productivity might be sufficiently large so that her fellow islanders might be better off through exchanges with her than they were before she privately appropriated her plot of land	eve s appropriation might be small enough and her increased productivity might be sufficiently large so that her fellow islander might be better off through exchange with her than they be before she privately appropriate her plot of land
I shall not at this point contest Gauthier s conclusion that Eve s appropriation can be beneficial both to herself and the other islanders	i shall not at this point contest gauthier s conclusion that eve s appropriation can be beneficial both to herself and the other islander
In this section I shall assume that Gauthier is right about Eve s appropriation being beneficial	in this section i shall assume that gauthier be right about eve s appropriation be beneficial
My problem with Gauthier s method is that he gives only a partial justification of possible forms of appropriation in the state of nature	my problem with gauthier s method be that he give only a partial justification of possible form of appropriation in the state of nature
Gauthier never considers other forms of ownership in addition to private ownership that might be beneficial in much the same way as private ownership	gauthier never consider other form of ownership in addition to private ownership that might be beneficial in much the same way as private ownership
The benefits of Eve s private appropriation arise because intensive agriculture may produce greater quantities of food per acre than unimproved land	the benefit of eve s private appropriation arise because intensive agriculture may produce great quantity of food per acre than unimproved land
Vesting in Eve the right to use the land and the right to what she produces is necessary in order for Eve rationally to undertake the labor of farming	vest in eve the right to use the land and the right to what she produce be necessary in order for eve rationally to undertake the labor of farming
As Hobbes wisely maintained long ago agriculture as well as industry is not rational unless one can count upon the rightful possession of what if agriculture or industry is to be rationally undertaken	as hobbes wisely maintain long ago agriculture as well as industry be not rational unless one can count upon the rightful possession of what if agriculture or industry be to be rationally undertake
While it is certainly true that private ownership vests in appropriators the rights rationally needed for such an undertaking it is just as certainly true that other possible forms of ownership vest in appropriators rights which satisfy the same rational necessity	while it be certainly true that private ownership vest in appropriator the right rationally need for such a undertaking it be just as certainly true that other possible form of ownership vest in appropriator right which satisfy the same rational necessity
Gauthier s justification is only a partial justification because he does not consider forms other than private ownership	gauthier s justification be only a partial justification because he do not consider form other than private ownership
Suppose instead of Eve s private appropriation that a group of persons Karl Friedrich and Rosa agree to collectively appropriate land for the purpose of intensive cultivation They agree to share evenly both the work of farming and the product produced	suppose instead of eve s private appropriation that a group of person karl friedrich and rosa agree to collectively appropriate land for the purpose of intensive cultivation they agree to share evenly both the work of farming and the product produce
With their increased productivity Karl Friedrich and Rosa could exchange their products with the other islanders as does Eve	with their increased productivity karl friedrich and rosa could exchange their product with the other islander as do eve
This form of collective ownership has the same economic consequences in the state of nature as does Eve s private appropriation	this form of collective ownership have the same economic consequence in the state of nature as do eve s private appropriation
Thus if Eve s appropriation is morally justifiable then so is the collective appropriation by Karl Friedrich and s terms sufficiently compensate any losers 	thus if eve s appropriation be morally justifiable then so be the collective appropriation by karl friedrich and s term sufficiently compensate any losers 
Such collective ownership in itself might be a morally compatible alternative to Eve s private appropriation which could be practiced along with private ownership without any moral incoherence	such collective ownership in itself might be a morally compatible alternative to eve s private appropriation which could be practice along with private ownership without any moral incoherence
But collective ownership could further evolve by stages consistent with Gauthier s justification into a form of ownership which is morally very different from private ownership	but collective ownership could far evolve by stage consistent with gauthier s justification into a form of ownership which be morally very different from private ownership
This collective ownership by Karl Friedrich and Rosa could evolve within the confines established by Gauthier into an islandwide social ownership	this collective ownership by karl friedrich and rosa could evolve within the confine establish by gauthier into a islandwide social ownership
Imagine that the other islanders see the success achieved by Karl Friedrich and Rosa so that they too desire to join the collective	imagine that the other islander see the success achieve by karl friedrich and rosa so that they too desire to join the collective
So instead of exchanging what they produce with the collective the other islanders judge themselves better off by joining the collective as coworkers	so instead of exchange what they produce with the collective the other islander judge themselves better off by join the collective as coworker
Since the land collectively farmed could be expanded or the number of products could be multiplied Karl Friedrich and Rosa could judge themselves better off as well	since the land collectively farm could be expand or the number of product could be multiply karl friedrich and rosa could judge themselves better off as well
All islanders might see the advantages of social ownership and management of the island	all islander might see the advantage of social ownership and management of the island
They could agree to social selfmanagement and ownership of the land and resources on the island 	they could agree to social selfmanagement and ownership of the land and resource on the island 
Neither the collective ownership by Karl Friedrich and Rosa nor the social ownership by all the islanders need be equivalent to private ownership in its variant forms of joint or corporate ownership	neither the collective ownership by karl friedrich and rosa nor the social ownership by all the islander need be equivalent to private ownership in its variant form of joint or corporate ownership
Such private ownership rights as bequest exchange or alienation need not be included in the rights which vest in the members of the collective	such private ownership right as bequest exchange or alienation need not be include in the right which vest in the member of the collective
The form of ownership may not permit any right to alienate the land that is identified with the people who live on it	the form of ownership may not permit any right to alienate the land that be identify with the people who live on it
Such is the case Marx cites of primitive forms of communism as well as with the concept of ownership held by Native American tribes	such be the case marx cite of primitive form of communism as well as with the concept of ownership hold by native american tribe
That Karl Rosa and Friedrich agree to cooperate does not violate Gauthier s assumptions about human motivation	that karl rosa and friedrich agree to cooperate do not violate gauthier s assumption about human motivation
Gauthier defends a subjective theory of value	gauthier defend a subjective theory of value
A person s considered preferences determine her reasons for choice and action	a person be consider preference determine her reason for choice and action
Even though Gauthier s basic motivational assumption is the subjective theory of value he sometimes describes his or nontuistic	even though gauthier s basic motivational assumption be the subjective theory of value he sometimes describe his or nontuistic
Several commentators have noted that Gauthier s descriptions are not equivalent A subjective theory of value does not logically limit a person s motivation only to choices that are selfinterested or nontuistic	several commentator have note that gauthier s description be not equivalent a subjective theory of value do not logically limit a person s motivation only to choice that be selfinterested or nontuistic
Someone may prefer to advance the interests of others eg the interests of friends and lovedones	someone may prefer to advance the interest of others eg the interest of friend and lovedones
Selfinterest and nontuism of course limit the content of preferences	selfinterest and nontuism of course limit the content of preference
If Karl Rosa and Friedrich prefer to cooperate then there is no incompatibility with a subjective theory of value	if karl rosa and friedrich prefer to cooperate then there be no incompatibility with a subjective theory of value
Karl s Rosa s and Friedrich s choice to cooperate also need not violate either the assumption of selfinterest or of nontuism	karl s rosa s and friedrich s choice to cooperate also need not violate either the assumption of selfinterest or of nontuism
Gauthier s argument in Morals by Agreement depends upon this	gauthier s argument in moral by agreement depend upon this
Gauthier s decision to base the initial position upon a private appropriation is therefore one plausible choice but it is not the only logical or best one	gauthier s decision to base the initial position upon a private appropriation be therefore one plausible choice but it be not the only logical or best one
Private ownership and exchange is one way individuals may benefit but it is not the only way	private ownership and exchange be one way individual may benefit but it be not the only way
Working together and sharing the increased productivity is another	work together and share the increased productivity be another
Cooperation is not incompatible with assumptions about selfinterest or nontuism	cooperation be not incompatible with assumption about selfinterest or nontuism
Nor can Gauthier argue that cooperation between Karl Friedrich and Rosa is excluded because it would be a contract before the social contract	nor can gauthier argue that cooperation between karl friedrich and rosa be exclude because it would be a contract before the social contract
First of all as I remarked earlier social contract theorists have dealt with the problem of initial distribution by both precontract and contractdependent methodologies	first of all as i remark early social contract theorist have deal with the problem of initial distribution by both precontract and contractdependent methodology
Nothing in the idea of a social contract necessitates a precontract methodology rather than a contractdependent one	nothing in the idea of a social contract necessitate a precontract methodology rather than a contractdependent one
Second Gauthier s own method must permit precontract agreements and cooperation both of which are presupposed by the free market which Gauthier believes exists prior to and is the reason for morals by why Gauthier s justification of private ownership is only a partial justification	second gauthier s own method must permit precontract agreement and cooperation both of which be presuppose by the free market which gauthier believe exist prior to and be the reason for moral by why gauthier s justification of private ownership be only a partial justification
He simply fails to discuss other forms of ownership which could plausibly fit his justificatory schema	he simply fail to discuss other form of ownership which could plausibly fit his justificatory schema
My example of collective ownership and social ownership could equally arise in Gauthier s stateofnature circumstances	my example of collective ownership and social ownership could equally arise in gauthier s stateofnature circumstance
Gauthier does not consider this possibility	gauthier do not consider this possibility
I do not believe Gauthier sees his Eve illustration as demonstrating that private ownership is only morally permissible and not morally required	i do not believe gauthier see his eve illustration as demonstrate that private ownership be only morally permissible and not morally require
Gauthier says nothing that would even hint at this option	gauthier say nothing that would even hint at this option
Besides even if Gauthier s intention were to prove only that private ownership is morally permissible his justification would still be partial because he has not demonstrated that some forms and only some forms of ownership are morally permissible	besides even if gauthier s intention be to prove only that private ownership be morally permissible his justification would still be partial because he have not demonstrate that some form and only some form of ownership be morally permissible
Gauthier s attempt at justifying private ownership from an original appropriation in the state of nature fails to produce a complete justification of private ownership which shows that private ownership and only private ownership is morally justifiable	gauthier s attempt at justify private ownership from a original appropriation in the state of nature fail to produce a complete justification of private ownership which show that private ownership and only private ownership be morally justifiable
His justification is partial because his arguments fail to exclude other possible forms of ownership	his justification be partial because his argument fail to exclude other possible form of ownership
Gauthier is not unique in has carefully compared the implications of different forms of ownership in state of nature conditions	gauthier be not unique in have carefully compare the implication of different form of ownership in state of nature condition
It is not a sufficient proof to establish merely that private ownership is an improvement upon the state of nature	it be not a sufficient proof to establish merely that private ownership be a improvement upon the state of nature
A complete justification must actually show that no other possible form of ownership can do as well	a complete justification must actually show that no other possible form of ownership can do as well
In this section I shall focus upon the issue of scarcity in the state of nature	in this section i shall focus upon the issue of scarcity in the state of nature
Thus Gauthier s justification may be successful only in exceptional circumstances	thus gauthier s justification may be successful only in exceptional circumstance
Moreover in such exceptional circumstances any form of ownership would be unnecessary	moreover in such exceptional circumstance any form of ownership would be unnecessary
One of Locke s own examples aptly illuminates this point	one of locke s own example aptly illuminate this point
Locke asks who could complain were someone to take a large draught of water from a great river if enough water remains for everyone else to do the same Gauthier realizes that neither land nor resources actually exist in such superabundance	locke ask who could complain be someone to take a large draught of water from a great river if enough water remain for everyone else to do the same gauthier realize that neither land nor resource actually exist in such superabundance
But Gauthier does not seem to realize that were Locke s criterion fulfilled no form of ownership whatsoever would be necessary	but gauthier do not seem to realize that be locke s criteria fulfil no form of ownership whatsoever would be necessary
Hume is well aware of this when he argues that scarcity is a necessary prerequisite of having any form of ownership	hume be well aware of this when he argue that scarcity be a necessary prerequisite of have any form of ownership
Braybrooke argues that Gauthier s contract unlike Locke s can not be applied in history because of its fantastic demands on information which no contracting parties could meet Braybrooke focuses upon the empirical impossibility of ever fulfilling the conditions of the contract	braybrooke argue that gauthier s contract unlike locke s can not be apply in history because of its fantastic demand on information which no contracting party could meet braybrooke focus upon the empirical impossibility of ever fulfil the condition of the contract
My point is different in that it rests on a conceptual not an empirical difficulty	my point be different in that it rest on a conceptual not a empirical difficulty
I shall not be concerned about whether Gauthier s stateofnature conditions ever historically existed	i shall not be concerned about whether gauthier s stateofnature condition ever historically exist
My objection is that if Gauthier s stateofnature conditions could be fulfilled there would be no reason to have any form of ownership whatsoever	my objection be that if gauthier s stateofnature condition could be fulfil there would be no reason to have any form of ownership whatsoever
The historical question about whether or not the conditions of Gauthier s state of nature ever could be fulfilled is not crucial	the historical question about whether or not the condition of gauthier s state of nature ever could be fulfil be not crucial
Gauthier s premise that Eve s appropriation not worsen the condition of others seems to acknowledge that land does not exist in superabundance	gauthier s premise that eve s appropriation not worsen the condition of others seem to acknowledge that land do not exist in superabundance
The implication seems to be that Eve s appropriation could make others worse off so that in a fixed limited supply	the implication seem to be that eve s appropriation could make others bad off so that in a fixed limited supply
Gauthier s assumption of scarcity appears realistic enough to avoid the unrealistic abundance which Hume believes makes ownership unnecessary	gauthier s assumption of scarcity appear realistic enough to avoid the unrealistic abundance which hume believe make ownership unnecessary
But once Gauthier s assumption is examined more closely it is not at all obvious that Eve s appropriation will not violate the proviso unless land exists in an unrealistically abundant quantity	but once gauthier s assumption be examine more closely it be not at all obvious that eve s appropriation will not violate the proviso unless land exist in a unrealistically abundant quantity
Gauthier argues that even though Eve s appropriation of land may worsen the condition of the other islanders because they lose the use of Eve s land Eve s increased productivity will actually enable her to improve the condition of the others	gauthier argue that even though eve s appropriation of land may worsen the condition of the other islander because they lose the use of eve s land eve s increased productivity will actually enable her to improve the condition of the others
Such arguments would have to demonstrate that Eve can be sufficiently productive is therefore necessary to estimate Eve s productivity and the other islander s losses	such argument would have to demonstrate that eve can be sufficiently productive be therefore necessary to estimate eve s productivity and the other islander s loss
What are the benefits Eve and her family receive Gauthier claims she intends to benefit herself and her family by a more efficient and productive cultivation of her land	what be the benefit eve and her family receive gauthier claim she intend to benefit herself and her family by a more efficient and productive cultivation of her land
Gauthier further assumes that those benefits Eve seeks must derive from an increased quantity of food which will be exchanged with the other islanders	gauthier far assume that those benefit eve seek must derive from a increased quantity of food which will be exchange with the other islander
Eve might however have chosen to benefit herself and her family by using her increased efficiency in production to create greater leisure for her and her family	eve might however have choose to benefit herself and her family by use her increased efficiency in production to create great leisure for her and her family
There is nothing in Gauthier s subjective theory of value to preclude Eve from judging her leisure as a benefit	there be nothing in gauthier s subjective theory of value to preclude eve from judge her leisure as a benefit
Obviously for Gauthier leisure is not the kind of benefit Eve must produce in order for her appropriation to be justifiable because it would not enable her to compensate the others	obviously for gauthier leisure be not the kind of benefit eve must produce in order for her appropriation to be justifiable because it would not enable her to compensate the others
The gains that Eve must intend to produce for herself and her family must be benefits that are divisible exchangeable and valued by the other islanders	the gain that eve must intend to produce for herself and her family must be benefit that be divisible exchangeable and value by the other islander
Eve must therefore intend better housing or clothing for her family	eve must therefore intend better housing or clothing for her family
In any case the quantity of exchanageable material goods which Eve must produce in order to justify her appropriation will depend upon the losses of the other islanders	in any case the quantity of exchanageable material good which eve must produce in order to justify her appropriation will depend upon the loss of the other islander
The other islanders lose their use of Eve s land the right to manage it the income from it the fight to trespass hunt gather and so on which before Eve s appropriation they had in common	the other islander lose their use of eve s land the right to manage it the income from it the fight to trespass hunt gather and so on which before eve s appropriation they have in common
If the quantity of land on the island is large compared to the population this reduces the value of the loss of land due to Eve s appropriation	if the quantity of land on the island be large compare to the population this reduce the value of the loss of land due to eve s appropriation
But by the same reasoning if the population is large compared to quantity of land the loss will be substantial	but by the same reasoning if the population be large compare to quantity of land the loss will be substantial
Suppose for the sake of argument that the only benefit or loss relevant to Eve s appropriation is the food supply	suppose for the sake of argument that the only benefit or loss relevant to eve s appropriation be the food supply
This is a much too narrow assumption in light of the variety of rights which the islanders lose to Eve but Gauthier s derivation depends upon unrealistic assumptions about the land	this be a much too narrow assumption in light of the variety of right which the islander lose to eve but gauthier s derivation depend upon unrealistic assumption about the land
Granted this assumption the increase in Eve s food production must be greater than the loss of naturally available food the islanders could appropriate before Eve s appropriation	grant this assumption the increase in eve s food production must be great than the loss of naturally available food the islander could appropriate before eve s appropriation
Gauthier asserts without argument that Eve can produce more food by agriculture than was available before her appropriation	gauthier assert without argument that eve can produce more food by agriculture than be available before her appropriation

In such cases Eve s private appropriation would not be justifiable because she could not satisfy produce sufficient surplus food	in such case eve s private appropriation would not be justifiable because she could not satisfy produce sufficient surplus food
These counterinstances may not be an objection to Gauthier s argument if he is trying to show that private appropriation is justifiable only under some special conditions	these counterinstances may not be a objection to gauthier s argument if he be try to show that private appropriation be justifiable only under some special condition
Gauthier may not be arguing that private appropriation is always rationally justifiable because he does not believe either that the free market or morals by agreement are always rational	gauthier may not be argue that private appropriation be always rationally justifiable because he do not believe either that the free market or moral by agreement be always rational

This surplus must be sufficiently large to compensate all those who lose by Eve s appropriation	this surplus must be sufficiently large to compensate all those who lose by eve s appropriation
But to render this argument germane to the actual circumstances Eve must confront it is necessary to drop the assumption that food is the only good which is gained or lost by Eve and the other islanders	but to render this argument germane to the actual circumstance eve must confront it be necessary to drop the assumption that food be the only good which be gain or lose by eve and the other islander
Gauthier must therefore prove that Eve s surplus is greater than the losses of others	gauthier must therefore prove that eve s surplus be great than the loss of others
Even with this expanded assumption only some of Eve s gains are relevant to calculating her ability to compensate the losers	even with this expanded assumption only some of eve s gain be relevant to calculate her ability to compensate the loser
As previously noted Eve could not choose to benefit herself with greater leisure because these benefits are not divisible and exchangeable with others	as previously note eve could not choose to benefit herself with great leisure because these benefit be not divisible and exchangeable with others
Nor could Eve use her spare time to manufacture widgets unless widgets were valued by the other islanders	nor could eve use her spare time to manufacture widget unless widget be value by the other islander

As Hume argues and as Locke s river illustrates in abundance there is no need for ownership	as hume argue and as locke s river illustrate in abundance there be no need for ownership

The second difference between private ownership and Gauthier s form illustrates how Gauthier violates Locke s nontheft condition	the second difference between private ownership and gauthier s form illustrate how gauthier violate locke s nontheft condition
This difference concerns the right to the income from what one owns	this difference concern the right to the income from what one own
Gauthier believes rent produced by what they own	gauthier believe rent produce by what they own
Gauthier uses the example of the income Wayne Gretzky may rightfully earn from the use of his self and his labor Private ownership would vest in Gretzky the right to any income he could obtain without force or fraud in a free market	gauthier use the example of the income wayne gretzky may rightfully earn from the use of his self and his labor private ownership would vest in gretzky the right to any income he could obtain without force or fraud in a free market
Gauthier argues that Gretzky does not have this right	gauthier argue that gretzky do not have this right

This difference between the two sets of ownership rights is justified according to Gauthier because his form promotes economic efficiency and utility maximization in circumstances where a private ownership freemarket form does not	this difference between the two set of ownership right be justify according to gauthier because his form promote economic efficiency and utility maximization in circumstance where a private ownership freemarket form do not
Gauthier generalizes from the Gretzky example when he says In the state of nature if not always in society efficient use is a condition of rightful possession	gauthier generalize from the gretzky example when he say in the state of nature if not always in society efficient use be a condition of rightful possession
Although rights are temporally openended they are subject to alteration in light of changed the rights which vest in owners and may change the person in whom the fights vest	although right be temporally openended they be subject to alteration in light of changed the right which vest in owner and may change the person in whom the fight vest
Owners may lose rights over what they own or even lose the things they own if economic efficiency and utility could thereby be promoted	owner may lose right over what they own or even lose the thing they own if economic efficiency and utility could thereby be promote
The owner s consent is not a requirement according to Gauthier for owners to lose what they own	the owner s consent be not a requirement according to gauthier for owner to lose what they own
Thus Locke s nontheft condition is clearly violated	thus locke s nontheft condition be clearly violate
Locke s idea of private ownership and Honore s as well do not restrict private owners to only economically efficient and utilitymaximizing uses of what they own	locke s idea of private ownership and honore be as well do not restrict private owner to only economically efficient and utilitymaximizing use of what they own
There is an unresolvable problem which Gauthier fails to notice when he says that in the state of nature efficient use is a condition of rightful possession	there be a unresolvable problem which gauthier fail to notice when he say that in the state of nature efficient use be a condition of rightful possession
Efficient use can only be measured after markets are established	efficient use can only be measure after market be establish

This is why Gauthier is correct in arguing that some form of ownership is a necessary prerequisite for Eve rationally to undertake her economically beneficial farming	this be why gauthier be correct in argue that some form of ownership be a necessary prerequisite for eve rationally to undertake her economically beneficial farming
Ignoring for the moment the circularity in attempting to define rightful possession in the state of nature by the criterion of efficient use Gauthier does not seem to appreciate that his own condition of efficient use may undermine the stability of possession	ignore for the moment the circularity in attempt to define rightful possession in the state of nature by the criteria of efficient use gauthier do not seem to appreciate that his own condition of efficient use may undermine the stability of possession
In the Treatise Hume discusses just this point He considers an actutilitarian criterion of title which would vest the rights of ownership in persons who could make the best use of what is owned	in the treatise hume discuss just this point he consider a actutilitarian criteria of title which would vest the right of ownership in person who could make the best use of what be own

Allocating ownables by a criterion of best or efficient use may paradoxically imply less good or efficient uses because people may refrain from risky investments and improvements	allocate ownables by a criteria of best or efficient use may paradoxically imply less good or efficient use because people may refrain from risky investment and improvement

His argument will have to be grounded upon premises concerning risk propensity and aversion ongoing debate over whether a propensity or aversion to risk is subject to rational assessment or whether it is merely a psychological disposition	his argument will have to be ground upon premise concerning risk propensity and aversion ongoing debate over whether a propensity or aversion to risk be subject to rational assessment or whether it be merely a psychological disposition
Even if it could be established that there are rational conditions for risk Gauthier would still need to argue that his efficient use criterion would leave ownership sufficiently certain and stable for risks to be rational	even if it could be establish that there be rational condition for risk gauthier would still need to argue that his efficient use criteria would leave ownership sufficiently certain and stable for risk to be rational

I have ignored Gauthier s point that compensation may be paid to the less efficient user if what is owned is appropriated by a more efficient user Requiring compensation will reduce risk uncertainty and instability	i have ignore gauthier s point that compensation may be pay to the less efficient user if what be own be appropriate by a more efficient user require compensation will reduce risk uncertainty and instability

Compensation as Gauthier is aware does lessen the problem	compensation as gauthier be aware do lessen the problem
But lessening the problem in this case may or may not remove it	but lessen the problem in this case may or may not remove it
If compensation is person whose rights are appropriated can establish the value to her of what is taken away then ownership may not be sufficiently uncertain to violate Hume s dictum	if compensation be person whose right be appropriate can establish the value to her of what be take away then ownership may not be sufficiently uncertain to violate hume s dictum
But a subjective evaluation of the level of compensation does not guarantee economic efficiency in fact it may obstruct economic efficiency eg in cases where homeowners refuse even outrageously large offers from real estate developers	but a subjective evaluation of the level of compensation do not guarantee economic efficiency in fact it may obstruct economic efficiency eg in case where homeowner refuse even outrageously large offer from real estate developer
The idea of market value compensation might be thought to be more appropriate	the idea of market value compensation might be think to be more appropriate
Market value compensation is problematic as I noted earlier discussing Gretzky and efficient use because market value as well as efficiency presuppose determinate criteria for rightful possession	market value compensation be problematic as i note early discuss gretzky and efficient use because market value as well as efficiency presuppose determinate criteria for rightful possession
Even so in situations where market value is less than subjective value the problem of uncertainty would not be solved	even so in situation where market value be less than subjective value the problem of uncertainty would not be solve
For high risks or for very costly improvements Gauthier s efficient use criterion even with the payment of compensation may have the effect of reducing economic efficiency rather than promoting it	for high risk or for very costly improvement gauthier s efficient use criteria even with the payment of compensation may have the effect of reduce economic efficiency rather than promote it

Specifically I will argue first that the libertarian thesis both entails a restitutionist and compensatory theory of remediation and excludes punitive remedial principles Accordingly I will also maintain that the conception of TOOLONG arising from libertarian considerations requires the elimination of the criminal law as we know it	specifically i will argue first that the libertarian thesis both entail a restitutionist and compensatory theory of remediation and exclude punitive remedial principles accordingly i will also maintain that the conception of toolong arise from libertarian consideration require the elimination of the criminal law as we know it
Finally I will argue that libertarian theory as framed by Nozick can not offer any justification for capital punishment but certain categories of wrongdoers	finally i will argue that libertarian theory as frame by nozick can not offer any justification for capital punishment but certain category of wrongdoer
Along the way I will contend that some of these unexpected results arise due to the exiguous grounding provided for the libertarian scheme of justice by Nozick and I will suggest that their resolution requires a more robust ethical foundation	along the way i will contend that some of these unexpected result arise due to the exiguous grounding provide for the libertarian scheme of justice by nozick and i will suggest that their resolution require a more robust ethical foundation
That recommended foundation however will only advance the case for compensatory remedies where restitution is not available	that recommended foundation however will only advance the case for compensatory remedy where restitution be not available
It will not provide support for criminal sanctions as we traditionally conceive of them	it will not provide support for criminal sanction as we traditionally conceive of them
In order to determine which theory of remediation is entailed by the libertarian thesis it will be necessary to formulate the view of justice which is expounded in that thesis and the concomitant theory of wrongdoing which is implied by it	in order to determine which theory of remediation be entail by the libertarian thesis it will be necessary to formulate the view of justice which be expound in that thesis and the concomitant theory of wrongdoing which be imply by it
Justice as conceivedof by libertarian theorists consists in the preservation of one s freedom of action with respect to those objects to which one has legitimate title	justice as conceivedof by libertarian theorist consist in the preservation of one s freedom of action with respect to those object to which one have legitimate title

Such a response could conceivably fall into one of three broad categories responses which seek recompense for the victim those which attempt solely to affect in some way the wrongdoer or some combination of the two	such a response could conceivably fall into one of three broad category response which seek recompense for the victim those which attempt solely to affect in some way the wrongdoer or some combination of the two

While it is obvious at least in outline what kinds of acts would be impermissible within a code of entitlementprotecting statutes the sanctions that would be provided for in that code are not immediately evident	while it be obvious at least in outline what kind of act would be impermissible within a code of entitlementprotecting statute the sanction that would be provide for in that code be not immediately evident
Generally we can say that if any category of attempted remedial action systematically fails to restore a transgressed entitlement it can not be the response required by the libertarian theory of justice because it fails to redress the particular injustice identified by that theory	generally we can say that if any category of attempted remedial action systematically fail to restore a transgress entitlement it can not be the response require by the libertarian theory of justice because it fail to redress the particular injustice identify by that theory
That is there may be other grounds for recommending such a response but they are not ones provided by the libertarian thesis	that is there may be other ground for recommend such a response but they be not one provide by the libertarian thesis
Furthermore if a suggested response to wrongdoing itself violates someone s rights it is forbidden by this theory of justice	furthermore if a suggested response to wrongdoing itself violate someone s right it be forbid by this theory of justice
The appropriate response to various categories of wrongdoing according to entitlement theory must be of a rightful action in an entitlement context	the appropriate response to various category of wrongdoing according to entitlement theory must be of a rightful action in a entitlement context
Such an analysis is embodied in the following principles Definition of Rightful Title A title to a human object is rightful if and only if it is claimed with respect to one s own person	such a analysis be embody in the following principle definition of rightful title a title to a human object be rightful if and only if it be claim with respect to one s own person

Once this restoration has taken place then according to entitlement theory the entitlement has been restored and hence the wrong however imperfectly and approximately has been remedied	once this restoration have take place then according to entitlement theory the entitlement have be restore and hence the wrong however imperfectly and approximately have be remedy
Before considering whether any further ie punitive response to wrongful actions of type or can be claimed on libertarian grounds I will examine a dilemma which it has been alleged accompanies the libertarian theory of remediation as it pertains to restitution	before consider whether any far ie punitive response to wrongful action of type or can be claim on libertarian ground i will examine a dilemma which it have be allege accompany the libertarian theory of remediation as it pertain to restitution
Lawrence Davis has argued that the restitutionism implied by libertarian a good many small injustices	lawrence davis have argue that the restitutionism imply by libertarian a good many small injustice
to be declared unrectifiable Davis s argument is that Nozick s entitlement theory identifies a particular distribution of holdings as	to be declare unrectifiable davis s argument be that nozick s entitlement theory identify a particular distribution of holding as
just if and only if each person s holdings under some distribution Dx includes and only includes those particular objects to which he is entitled by Nozick s principle of justice in acquisition transfer and rectification	just if and only if each person s holding under some distribution dx include and only include those particular object to which he be entitle by nozick s principle of justice in acquisition transfer and rectification
But assume says Davis that I steal a banana which rightly belongs to you and eat it	but assume say davis that i steal a banana which rightly belong to you and eat it
Thereafter he argues no just distribution can be achieved for your entitlement was to a particular banana which no longer exists	thereafter he argue no just distribution can be achieve for your entitlement be to a particular banana which no long exist
No rectification is possible since your stolen entitlement can not be returned to you	no rectification be possible since your stolen entitlement can not be return to you
A theory of remediation which provides no possible remedy for such transgressions would appear profoundly deficient	a theory of remediation which provide no possible remedy for such transgression would appear profoundly deficient
Davis suggests that rather than agree to such consequences Nozick might appeal to the theory of compensation delineated by him in Part I of Anarchy State and Utopia	davis suggest that rather than agree to such consequence nozick might appeal to the theory of compensation delineate by him in part i of anarchy state and utopia
According to this substitute principle goods which make the offended party indifferent between the destroyed holdings to which he was entitled and those used to compensate him for their loss constitute a legitimate recompense	according to this substitute principle good which make the offended party indifferent between the destroyed holding to which he be entitle and those use to compensate him for their loss constitute a legitimate recompense
The abandonment of entitlement criteria of distribution in one part of the theory may be the genesis of a slippery slope which threatens its other parts	the abandonment of entitlement criteria of distribution in one part of the theory may be the genesis of a slippery slope which threaten its other part
For example suppose I forcibly prevent you from acquiring an object but then compensate you such that you are indifferent between the holdings that without my intervention you would have had and the compensation that I have given you	for example suppose i forcibly prevent you from acquire a object but then compensate you such that you be indifferent between the holding that without my intervention you would have have and the compensation that i have give you
Entitlement theory proscribes such forcible interferences whereas this utilitarian substitute would permit them provided that the victim is suitably compensated	entitlement theory proscribe such forcible interference whereas this utilitarian substitute would permit them provided that the victim be suitably compensate
Similarly transfers of property could be forcibly prevented and fully justified if the requisite compensatory actions were taken by the aggressor	similarly transfer of property could be forcibly prevent and fully justify if the requisite compensatory action be take by the aggressor
Nozick then appears caught on the horns of a dilemma	nozick then appear catch on the horn of a dilemma
The entitlement theory strictly applied would allow certain wrongs to go unrectified while the utilitybased theory of compensation which could extricate the entire theory	the entitlement theory strictly apply would allow certain wrong to go unrectified while the utilitybased theory of compensation which could extricate the entire theory
This particular dilemma seems to be resolvable	this particular dilemma seem to be resolvable
Rights are sometimes described as social conditions necessary for the satisfaction of certain commonly held but separately sought objectives	right be sometimes describe as social condition necessary for the satisfaction of certain commonly hold but separately seek objective
For example in Reason and Morality Alan Gewirth argues that rights are social claims which are deducible from the fact that human beings by nature strive to fulfill purposes	for example in reason and morality alan gewirth argue that right be social claim which be deducible from the fact that human being by nature strive to fulfill purpose
Similarly Loren Lomasky in Persons Rights necessary social conditions to which hypothetical contractors would agree in order to realize their longrange personal projects	similarly loren lomasky in person right necessary social condition to which hypothetical contractor would agree in order to realize their longrange personal project
According to Gewirth s theory these rights are identical in content for every person because the social conditions required for purpose fulfillment are determined by certain universal features of human nature	according to gewirth s theory these right be identical in content for every person because the social condition require for purpose fulfillment be determine by certain universal feature of human nature
Thus the rights which logically must be claimed by human beings can not vary from person to person	thus the right which logically must be claim by human being can not vary from person to person
If this Gewirthian sort of argument could be so revised as to support Nozick s rights of historical entitlement then the property rights of libertarian theory would have been justified as the conditions which must be rationally claimed as necessary means to purpose fulfillment	if this gewirthian sort of argument could be so revised as to support nozick s right of historical entitlement then the property right of libertarian theory would have be justify as the condition which must be rationally claim as necessary mean to purpose fulfillment
Probably given the moral theory adumbrated in Philosophical Explanation Nozick himself would not defend property rights in this way	probably give the moral theory adumbrate in philosophical explanation nozick himself would not defend property right in this way
However my point here is that such a defense can conceivably be devised for the rights propounded in Anarchy State and Utopia	however my point here be that such a defense can conceivably be devise for the right propound in anarchy state and utopia
Gewirth for example argues that freedom of action is a necessary condition of purpose fulfillment	gewirth for example argue that freedom of action be a necessary condition of purpose fulfillment
One can imagine a defended by Nozick	one can imagine a defend by nozick
Indeed Lomasky makes just such an argument in his book	indeed lomasky make just such a argument in his book
That is suppose it is maintained that the satisfaction of purposes requires the possession of the material means necessary to such satisfaction	that is suppose it be maintain that the satisfaction of purpose require the possession of the material mean necessary to such satisfaction
It could be further argued that such means are only produced by the efforts of specific individuals and that in order to assure their availability for purpose fulfillment to those who produced them or traded for them absolute title to them must be guaranteed to those persons	it could be far argue that such mean be only produce by the effort of specific individual and that in order to assure their availability for purpose fulfillment to those who produce them or trade for them absolute title to them must be guarantee to those person
Where that guarantee is transgressed by theft it would follow from the entitlement thesis itself that the stolen object be returned to its owner	where that guarantee be transgress by theft it would follow from the entitlement thesis itself that the stolen object be return to its owner
But where the stolen object has been destroyed or consumed and hence can not be returned it would seem that an argument for suitable recompense could be devised which would have the same logical lineage as the purposebased deduction of the generic rights of historical entitlement	but where the stolen object have be destroy or consume and hence can not be return it would seem that a argument for suitable recompense could be devise which would have the same logical lineage as the purposebased deduction of the generic right of historical entitlement
That is if it could be argued that absolute property rights are necessary to satisfy the purposes of those who fashioned the property stolen objects can not be returned to their owners substitute objects which equally satisfy the owners purposes would serve them as legitimate recompense	that is if it could be argue that absolute property right be necessary to satisfy the purpose of those who fashion the property stolen object can not be return to their owner substitute object which equally satisfy the owner purpose would serve them as legitimate recompense
One way of measuring equal satisfaction would be the indifference criterion proposed by Nozick	one way of measure equal satisfaction would be the indifference criteria propose by nozick
If it could be further contended that the transgressor incurs an obligation to make recompense because of his transgression then he is obligated to supply whatever substitute will raise his victim to the appropriate indifference curve	if it could be far contend that the transgressor incur a obligation to make recompense because of his transgression then he be obligate to supply whatever substitute will raise his victim to the appropriate indifference curve
And that substitute because it is required to replace the transgressed entitlements of the victim can no longer be claimed by the transgressor as his legitimate property	and that substitute because it be require to replace the transgress entitlement of the victim can no long be claim by the transgressor as his legitimate property
Its transfer from transgressor to victim rectifies an unjust distribution of goods by removing from the transgressor s holdings goods which he owes to his victim in virtue of his transgression and to which therefore he is no longer entitled	its transfer from transgressor to victim rectify a unjust distribution of good by remove from the transgressor s holding good which he owe to his victim in virtue of his transgression and to which therefore he be no long entitle
On this view the principle of historical entitlement must be upheld as the means necessary for purpose fulfillment generally	on this view the principle of historical entitlement must be uphold as the mean necessary for purpose fulfillment generally
Thus it is plausible to think that Nozick s theory of compensation could be integrated into his doctrine of rectification without thereby eviscerating the entire entitlement thesis	thus it be plausible to think that nozick s theory of compensation could be integrate into his doctrine of rectification without thereby eviscerate the entire entitlement thesis
appropriate punitive measures for wrongdoing without undercutting the entitlement theory In his Philosophical Explanations Nozick is unequivocal in his support for retributive punishment while throughout Anarchy State and Utopia he seems to assume that there is no theoretical opposition between his libertarianism and punitive remedies for wrongdoing	appropriate punitive measure for wrongdoing without undercut the entitlement theory in his philosophical explanation nozick be unequivocal in his support for retributive punishment while throughout anarchy state and utopia he seem to assume that there be no theoretical opposition between his libertarianism and punitive remedy for wrongdoing
We may test the correctness of this assumption by answering two questions	we may test the correctness of this assumption by answer two question
First can punishment whether employed for deterrence incapacitation or retribution be derived as a principle of remediation from libertarian theory Second if it can not be so derived is punishment at least compatible with libertarian principles	first can punishment whether employ for deterrence incapacitation or retribution be derive as a principle of remediation from libertarian theory second if it can not be so derive be punishment at least compatible with libertarian principle
Let us consider the two types of wrongdoing to which we previously alluded the illicit use of an object belonging to another and the illicit tranformation of an object belonging to another	let us consider the two type of wrongdoing to which we previously allude the illicit use of a object belong to another and the illicit tranformation of a object belong to another
Let us expand the second category of wrongdoing so as to include the illicit destruction or consumption of objects	let us expand the second category of wrongdoing so as to include the illicit destruction or consumption of object

Now we may ask once restitution or compensation for wrongs or has been achieved can any further remedy for them be exacted on entitlement grounds This is our derivation question	now we may ask once restitution or compensation for wrong or have be achieve can any far remedy for them be exact on entitlement ground this be our derivation question
The answer to this question seems to be no	the answer to this question seem to be no
If the removal of an entitlement is the wrong created restoration of that entitlement or suitable compensation for its loss is the only possible remedy that can serve as a moral corrective	if the removal of a entitlement be the wrong created restoration of that entitlement or suitable compensation for its loss be the only possible remedy that can serve as a moral corrective
As for the possible imprisonment of the wrongdoer such an action must be instrumental to the restorative process in order to be given an entitlement justification	as for the possible imprisonment of the wrongdoer such a action must be instrumental to the restorative process in order to be give a entitlement justification
If for example it could be argued that a thief would not make his victim whole unless incarcerated and compelled to do so then his imprisonment would be The entitlement theory then would seem to sanction only restitution or compensation as an appropriate moral response to wrongdoing	if for example it could be argue that a thief would not make his victim whole unless incarcerate and compel to do so then his imprisonment would be the entitlement theory then would seem to sanction only restitution or compensation as a appropriate moral response to wrongdoing
Punishment when not implemented as a means of either restoring transgressed entitlements or producing recompense for them becomes a morally superfluous exercise	punishment when not implement as a mean of either restore transgress entitlement or produce recompense for them become a morally superfluous exercise
These two points require further elaboration	these two point require far elaboration
First there is the matter of punishment	first there be the matter of punishment
It might be argued that entitlement theory in fact does entail some retributivist component as it must or ought to distinguish between degrees of culpability by adding to compensatory remedies punitive ones as well	it might be argue that entitlement theory in fact do entail some retributivist component as it must or ought to distinguish between degree of culpability by add to compensatory remedy punitive one as well
Surely it may be contended the law should not assign the same sanction for manslaughter as it does for murder is identical the extent of responsibility for each offense differs vastly	surely it may be contend the law should not assign the same sanction for manslaughter as it do for murder be identical the extent of responsibility for each offense differ vastly
Libertarian theory it can be maintained ought to recognize this difference by insinuating a retributive constituent into its conception of criminal justice	libertarian theory it can be maintain ought to recognize this difference by insinuate a retributive constituent into its conception of criminal justice
But while the libertarian theorist is not precluded from acknowledging the full spectrum of moral culpability which can attend any harmful act there is no room for the inclusion of the culpability factor in his formulations of just responses to wrongdoing	but while the libertarian theorist be not preclude from acknowledge the full spectrum of moral culpability which can attend any harmful act there be no room for the inclusion of the culpability factor in his formulation of just response to wrongdoing
Injustice consists wholly in illicit taking or damage	injustice consist wholly in illicit taking or damage
Hence justice must consist exclusively in replacement restoration or compensation from a specific individual or individuals	hence justice must consist exclusively in replacement restoration or compensation from a specific individual or individual
Criminal debt on entitlement grounds can only arise from the nonconsensual taking or alteration by someone of an entitlement that is not his	criminal debt on entitlement ground can only arise from the nonconsensual taking or alteration by someone of a entitlement that be not his
Once that debt is discharged by the wrongdoer any additional forcible taking of objects including his physical person owned by the wrongdoer constitutes the illicit seizure of an unencumbered entitlement and hence is itself a wrongdoing	once that debt be discharge by the wrongdoer any additional forcible taking of object including his physical person own by the wrongdoer constitute the illicit seizure of a unencumbered entitlement and hence be itself a wrongdoing
Punitive reaction to the nonconsensual use of the wrongdoer s entitlements is itself a wrong and as such requires restitutive remedy	punitive reaction to the nonconsensual use of the wrongdoer s entitlement be itself a wrong and as such require restitutive remedy
And if this is true for punishment which seeks retribution from the actor for his moral error then it is true as well for punishment whose purpose is to deter or prevent by incapacitation or forcible rehabilitation the commission of future wrongful acts	and if this be true for punishment which seek retribution from the actor for his moral error then it be true as well for punishment whose purpose be to deter or prevent by incapacitation or forcible rehabilitation the commission of future wrongful act
Therefore entitlement theory not only fails to provide justification for punitive measures which exceed what is required to make rightful restitution andor compensation but it implies the wrongfulness of such measures	therefore entitlement theory not only fail to provide justification for punitive measure which exceed what be require to make rightful restitution andor compensation but it imply the wrongfulness of such measure
Thus the answer to our second question is that the use of punishment as a remedy for wrongdoing is incompatible with libertarian theory	thus the answer to our second question be that the use of punishment as a remedy for wrongdoing be incompatible with libertarian theory
Now this implication is surprising enough suggesting as it does that libertarian theorists must argue for the elimination of the criminal law leaving only tort and contract law in its place	now this implication be surprising enough suggest as it do that libertarian theorist must argue for the elimination of the criminal law leave only tort and contract law in its place
However a still stronger result becomes apparent when one begins to consider what sort of sanction libertarian theory can endorse for murder	however a still strong result become apparent when one begin to consider what sort of sanction libertarian theory can endorse for murder
For what would be restored in the process The life of his victim would not thereby be recovered nor would the murderer s execution restore or repair any of the entitlements of the victim s heirs	for what would be restore in the process the life of his victim would not thereby be recover nor would the murderer s execution restore or repair any of the entitlement of the victim s heir
For these heirs were not entitled to the victim who like all human beings is according to libertarian theory entitled to himself	for these heir be not entitle to the victim who like all human being be according to libertarian theory entitle to himself
Moreover once these heirs have been compensated no further debt remains to be discharged	moreover once these heir have be compensate no far debt remain to be discharge
The execution of the murderer then would not only fail to serve a compensatory purpose it would be wrong as well for it would deprive the murderer of his entitlement to his physical person	the execution of the murderer then would not only fail to serve a compensatory purpose it would be wrong as well for it would deprive the murderer of his entitlement to his physical person
But what would be the basis of such a claim within libertarian theory Perhaps the libertarian could contend that in taking the life of his victim the murderer created a debt which can only be discharged through the taking of his own life	but what would be the basis of such a claim within libertarian theory perhaps the libertarian could contend that in take the life of his victim the murderer create a debt which can only be discharge through the taking of his own life
Similarly the debt can not be literally owed the victim who is obviously in no position to collect	similarly the debt can not be literally owe the victim who be obviously in no position to collect
Nor can the debt be owed to society its members have not been deprived of any of their entitlements through this murder	nor can the debt be owe to society its member have not be deprive of any of their entitlement through this murder
If someone unsuccessfully attempts to murder but nevertheless injures another and his victim requires the transplantation of an organ in order to survive the injury that organ may be wrested from the attacker even if that should jeopardize the assailant s own life	if someone unsuccessfully attempt to murder but nevertheless injure another and his victim require the transplantation of a organ in order to survive the injury that organ may be wrest from the attacker even if that should jeopardize the assailant s own life
If without the transfer of his own life to another the assailant will have successfully deprived another of his existence then the attacker becomes a debtor whose life if need be may be taken to restore the life of his victim	if without the transfer of his own life to another the assailant will have successfully deprive another of his existence then the attacker become a debtor whose life if need be may be take to restore the life of his victim
Given the radical restorationism implied by the libertarian entitlement theory it is not surprising that one of its adherents has defended restitution as a substitute for punishment in the allocation of criminal justice	give the radical restorationism imply by the libertarian entitlement theory it be not surprising that one of its adherent have defend restitution as a substitute for punishment in the allocation of criminal justice
What Randy Barnett in an essay arguing for the elimination of retributivist and utilitarian standards of criminal justice did not do was to explicitly link his restitutionism to the entitlement theory so obviously embraced by him	what randy barnett in a essay argue for the elimination of retributivist and utilitarian standard of criminal justice do not do be to explicitly link his restitutionism to the entitlement theory so obviously embrace by him
What is surprising is that one of his critics also a libertarian entitlement theorist has maintained	what be surprising be that one of his critic also a libertarian entitlement theorist have maintain

Clearly the libertarian entitlement theory alone will neither support nor tolerate punitive remedies	clearly the libertarian entitlement theory alone will neither support nor tolerate punitive remedy
If such remedies are desirable on other ground adherents of the libertarian entitlement theory must import other complementary principles on which to make a defense of them or abandon the entitlement theory altogether	if such remedy be desirable on other ground adherent of the libertarian entitlement theory must import other complementary principle on which to make a defense of them or abandon the entitlement theory altogether
If the former appears unattainable and the latter is unattractive the libertarian theoretician must be content with restitutive or compensatory means of rectifying injustice	if the former appear unattainable and the latter be unattractive the libertarian theoretician must be content with restitutive or compensatory mean of rectify injustice

Do these three formulations imply that individuals in the state of nature must be equal in property holdings however we interpret property holdings Some writers suggest that a condition of equality in the stock of land and produce of the land must exist after an appropriation	do these three formulation imply that individual in the state of nature must be equal in property holding however we interpret property holding some writer suggest that a condition of equality in the stock of land and produce of the land must exist after a appropriation
In all cases hereafter I mean by an appropriation of land a Lockean appropriation performed by mixing one s labor with it	in all case hereafter i mean by a appropriation of land a lockean appropriation perform by mix one s labor with it
Alan Ryan follows other contemporary commentators and translates the Proviso as requiring as much and as good being left to others even though Locke never uses such a formulation	alan ryan follow other contemporary commentator and translate the proviso as require as much and as good be leave to others even though locke never use such a formulation
Vincent Barry requires that in the state of nature two conditions exist the individuals are equal where this second condition clearly refers to some sort of equality of resources 	vincent barry require that in the state of nature two condition exist the individual be equal where this second condition clearly refer to some sort of equality of resources 
This in turn might weaken a broadly Lockean commitment to strong property rights in poststateofnature conditions of relative scarcity ie where the Proviso does not hold	this in turn might weaken a broadly lockean commitment to strong property right in poststateofnature condition of relative scarcity ie where the proviso do not hold
This is precisely the direction taken by Virginia Held Vincent Barry and others as we shall see	this be precisely the direction take by virginia hold vincent barry and others as we shall see
What then could Locke have meant by enough and as good Enough whatever else can not mean an equal amount	what then could locke have mean by enough and as good enough whatever else can not mean a equal amount
It refers to some other characteristic of what by he who has already appropriated land or goods of the land	it refer to some other characteristic of what by he who have already appropriate land or good of the land
It seems to compare what others have before an appropriator call him A appropriates and what those same others have after A s appropriation and whether their position has been worsened	it seem to compare what others have before a appropriator call him a appropriate and what those same others have after a be appropriation and whether their position have be worsen
It could mean that there must be enough left that those who have not yet appropriated land do not have so little left as to make them suffer physical deprivation for lack of property	it could mean that there must be enough leave that those who have not yet appropriate land do not have so little leave as to make them suffer physical deprivation for lack of property
But there is no textual evidence for this	but there be no textual evidence for this
A more demanding requirement would be that others are no worse off for the appropriation	a more demanding requirement would be that others be no bad off for the appropriation
This I believe is clearly what Locke means	this i believe be clearly what locke mean
In the second formulation of the Proviso Locke adds a strong conjunct to enough and as good	in the second formulation of the proviso locke add a strong conjunct to enough and as good
That is there must still be more left than those who have not yet appropriated could use	that be there must still be more left than those who have not yet appropriate could use
So if they had more than they could use before an appropriation and more than they could use after then relative amounts as appropriate are irrelevant 	so if they have more than they could use before a appropriation and more than they could use after then relative amount as appropriate be irrelevant 
The third formulation gives added credibility to this reading because it requires as large a possession left to be appropriated	the third formulation give added credibility to this reading because it require as large a possession leave to be appropriate
And clearly here Locke means not as large as that appropriated by A but as large as was there before the appropriation	and clearly here locke mean not as large as that appropriate by a but as large as be there before the appropriation
But how could as large a possession be left after some of it had been appropriated Obviously only if the amount of land and its produce was practically unlimited so that a single appropriation makes no practical difference to the amount still available	but how could as large a possession be leave after some of it have be appropriate obviously only if the amount of land and its produce be practically unlimited so that a single appropriation make no practical difference to the amount still available
Indeed Locke tells us just this in a passage following the second formulation	indeed locke tell us just this in a passage follow the second formulation
So that in effect there was never less left for others because of his enclosure for himself	so that in effect there be never less left for others because of his enclosure for himself
For he that leaves as much as another can make use of does as good as take nothing at all emphasis added	for he that leave as much as another can make use of do as good as take nothing at all emphasis add

The preposition as must compare ex ante and ex post situations of those having not yet appropriated all those except A	the preposition as must compare ex ante and ex post situation of those have not yet appropriate all those except a
It seems a simple requirement that the quality of the land which is left be the same	it seem a simple requirement that the quality of the land which be leave be the same
This makes an important point because Locke believes in the enormous multiplicative effect of labor upon land	this make a important point because locke believe in the enormous multiplicative effect of labor upon land
One reason why the Proviso can plausibly be effective in the state of nature in addition to the vast amount of land available is that mixing labor with land so increases its value and the rewards reaped from it	one reason why the proviso can plausibly be effective in the state of nature in addition to the vast amount of land available be that mixing labor with land so increase its value and the reward reap from it
Locke begins by saying labor can increase the value of land tenfold then a hundredfold and at one point a thousandfold The point is that of inequality than any slight discrepancies in size of original appropriation	locke begin by say labor can increase the value of land tenfold then a hundredfold and at one point a thousandfold the point be that of inequality than any slight discrepancy in size of original appropriation
Locke however makes clear that he is totally indifferent to even such radical disparities in wealth so that equality per se must be completely irrelevant to him 	locke however make clear that he be totally indifferent to even such radical disparity in wealth so that equality per se must be completely irrelevant to him 
The remarkable power of labor to produce so vast a multiplication of wealth might help explain the force of as good	the remarkable power of labor to produce so vast a multiplication of wealth might help explain the force of as good
Locke clearly thinks of property in Chapter V as real property and its products	locke clearly think of property in chapter xxv as real property and its product
Thus he must require that the acreage left is as responsive to labor inputs as it was before an appropriation else the overwhelming force of labor inputs to create wealth could be lost	thus he must require that the acreage left be as responsive to labor input as it be before a appropriation else the overwhelming force of labor input to create wealth could be lose
I submit then by that as original value to labor improved value	i submit then by that as original value to labor improved value
Concretely for agriculture he means as fertile and arable	concretely for agriculture he mean as fertile and arable
There is yet another way that labor improvement can make up for relatively slight inequalities in sizes of original appropriation	there be yet another way that labor improvement can make up for relatively slight inequality in size of original appropriation
While there is no money and thus no sophisticated commerce we can assume that there is barter and there is some textual evidence of wage employment Locke makes clear that the labormixing appropriators are net benefactors to the rest of mankind	while there be no money and thus no sophisticated commerce we can assume that there be barter and there be some textual evidence of wage employment locke make clear that the labormixing appropriator be net benefactor to the rest of mankind
Barter and wage labor are probably the mechanisms he has in mind In a simple premoney economy barter allows some specialization to emerge producing at least some gains from trade and the division of labor	barter and wage labor be probably the mechanism he have in mind in a simple premoney economy barter allow some specialization to emerge produce at least some gain from trade and the division of labor
This improves the lot of all	this improve the lot of all
It therefore seems clear that Locke s concerns within the state of nature are Paretian	it therefore seem clear that locke s concern within the state of nature be paretian
That is Am I better off or left the same after A appropriates his land or does his appropriation make me worse off	that be be i better off or leave the same after a appropriate his land or do his appropriation make me bad off
Locke s concerns are not egalitarian	locke s concern be not egalitarian
He is not concerned with A This bears powerfully upon arguments which use the force of the Proviso outside the state of nature	he be not concerned with a this bear powerfully upon argument which use the force of the proviso outside the state of nature

A Moral Problem in the Acquisition of Property Outside the State of Nature	a moral problem in the acquisition of property outside the state of nature
Needless to say the state of nature is a fiction in most societies there is no longer a frontier which constitutes such a source of unclaimed property	needless to say the state of nature be a fiction in most society there be no long a frontier which constitute such a source of unclaimed property
It would surely seem then that there is no source of unclaimed new property	it would surely seem then that there be no source of unclaimed new property
If this is correct we can only acquire property from some fixed finite stock all of which is already claimed by our fellows	if this be correct we can only acquire property from some fixed finite stock all of which be already claim by our fellow

Indeed this argument has been made both against the notion of private property as a right and against capitalism as a system dependent upon that right	indeed this argument have be make both against the notion of private property as a right and against capitalism as a system dependent upon that right
Even more serious for this attempt to justify moral rights to property is the dificulty that the Lockean proviso in the contemporary world of overpopulation and scarce resources can almost never be met	even more serious for this attempt to justify moral right to property be the dificulty that the lockean proviso in the contemporary world of overpopulation and scarce resource can almost never be meet
Instead more property for some will almost always bring about less for other emphasis added	instead more property for some will almost always bring about less for others emphasis add
Vincent Barry has taken the same position	vincent barry have take the same position
As they capitalists accumulate more and more property there is less and less for others	as they capitalist accumulate more and more property there be less and less for others
The relative positions of the parties with respect to property is not equal necessity lost Perhaps Locke provided an adequate defense of property in a hypothetical state of nature in which supply is inexhaustible and individuals are equal but that blissful Eden does not exist	the relative position of the party with respect to property be not equal necessity lose perhaps locke provide a adequate defense of property in a hypothetical state of nature in which supply be inexhaustible and individual be equal but that blissful eden do not exist

Note the zerosum nature of property accumulation assumed by both Held and Barry	note the zerosum nature of property accumulation assume by both hold and barry

This analysis if it can be maintained constitutes a devastating moral argument against private property	this analysis if it can be maintain constitute a devastating moral argument against private property
If Held and Barry are correct there are only two kinds of transfers of property	if hold and barry be correct there be only two kind of transfer of property
The first are the sort of justicepreserving transfers of entitlements to property envisioned by Nozick	the first be the sort of justicepreserving transfer of entitlement to property envision by nozick
However for Held and Barry these transactions must be for equal value and can not explain the unequal accumulation of property	however for hold and barry these transaction must be for equal value and can not explain the unequal accumulation of property
Thus you swap something to which you are justly entitled for entitled Such transfers are zerosum in the sense that neither of us gained or lost ie gains andor losses equalled zero The kind of transfers which Held and Barry describe are also zerosum the law calls the conversions	thus you swap something to which you be justly entitle for entitled such transfer be zerosum in the sense that neither of us gain or lose ie gain andor loss equal zero the kind of transfer which hold and barry describe be also zerosum the law call the conversion
More property for some brings about less for others Held tells us	more property for some bring about less for others hold tell us
As one has gained the other has lost says Barry	as one have gain the others have lose say barry
That is I get something from you for nothing they are zerosum because I am ahead some amount and you lose an equal amount 	that is i get something from you for nothing they be zerosum because i be ahead some amount and you lose a equal amount 
With the exception of the unusual case of an intentional gift this kind of transfer is by definition wrongful presumably carried out by force or fraud or at least exploitation of mistake or imprudence	with the exception of the unusual case of a intentional gift this kind of transfer be by definition wrongful presumably carry out by force or fraud or at least exploitation of mistake or imprudence
Thus any inequality in a freemarket society and there is undeniably a great deal condemns the source of the inequality as the result of something morally very similar to theft	thus any inequality in a freemarket society and there be undeniably a great deal condemn the source of the inequality as the result of something morally very similar to theft
Thus this line of argument proceeds the system constitute the source of this inequality	thus this line of argument proceeds the system constitute the source of this inequality
Ergo the system is based upon immoral or at the very least morally unjustified conversions	ergo the system be base upon immoral or at the very least morally unjustified conversion
One reason why it seems clear that Held and Barry assume this zerosum theory is the one example adduced by both	one reason why it seem clear that hold and barry assume this zerosum theory be the one example adduce by both
Barry gives the enclosure movement as a case of capitalists getting rich by taking from others	barry give the enclosure movement as a case of capitalist get rich by take from others
It is the perfect historical example of their theory of inequality being produced by zerosum transfer Indeed that Barry chooses the enclosure movement as the primary example of property accumulation reveals how deep the zerosum notion is in this view	it be the perfect historical example of their theory of inequality be produce by zerosum transfer indeed that barry choose the enclosure movement as the primary example of property accumulation reveal how deep the zerosum notion be in this view

Then Lord Bad encloses appropriates the land as his exclusive property denying its use to Peasants Good Nice and Kind	then lord bad enclose appropriate the land as his exclusive property deny its use to peasant good nice and kind
Antecedently Bad Good Nice and Kind had let us say acres to use	antecedently bad good nice and kind have let us say acre to use

I think we must agree with Barry if we assume custom can be a source of rights which I do that the enclosure movement at least as here simplistically represented constitutes a wrongful as well as a zerosum taking	i think we must agree with barry if we assume custom can be a source of right which i do that the enclosure movement at least as here simplistically represent constitute a wrongful as well as a zerosum take
But what would make Barry and Held as well believe that the enclosure movement is characteristic of capitalist property acquisition or accumulation Indeed prima facie it seems dramatically atypical	but what would make barry and hold as well believe that the enclosure movement be characteristic of capitalist property acquisition or accumulation indeed prima facie it seem dramatically atypical
Property usually changes hands for valuable consideration	property usually change hand for valuable consideration
How could they arrive at this conclusion Let us see	how could they arrive at this conclusion let us see
What is the nature of the wrong in such conversions as the enclosure movement It may well be that the wrong is deontological in nature a violation of a right to property	what be the nature of the wrong in such conversion as the enclosure movement it may well be that the wrong be deontological in nature a violation of a right to property
Where Nozick sees such conversions this is the only reason for their wrongfulness although for Nozick the class of wrongful conversions is much narrower than for Held and Barry But there are ones	where nozick see such conversion this be the only reason for their wrongfulness although for nozick the class of wrongful conversion be much narrow than for hold and barry but there be one
First such transfers will lead to relative inequality	first such transfer will lead to relative inequality
This would be a problem for Held and Barry but not for Locke as we saw nor for Nozick nor for the author Held and Barry are egalitarians with respect to transactions	this would be a problem for hold and barry but not for locke as we see nor for nozick nor for the author hold and barry be egalitarian with respect to transaction

However most would agree Held and Barry included that there is a second and more serious consequential wrong in a world without the frontier ie with a closed and finite stock of property	however most would agree hold and barry include that there be a second and more serious consequential wrong in a world without the frontier ie with a closed and finite stock of property
That is sufficient inequality might well lead to physical deprivation and suffering as it will not in Locke s state of nature since sufficient land and its produce was always present there to prevent it	that is sufficient inequality might well lead to physical deprivation and suffering as it will not in locke s state of nature since sufficient land and its produce be always present there to prevent it
Thus on this account in the closed finite property case I can accumulate two more units of property only by denying them to you and to everyone else on the assumption that antecedently you had their use and enjoyment	thus on this account in the closed finite property case i can accumulate two more unit of property only by deny them to you and to everyone else on the assumption that antecedently you have their use and enjoyment
Think of the enclosure example where great is denied you and very little or none left for you then you might well have so little that you suffer	think of the enclosure example where great be deny you and very little or none left for you then you might well have so little that you suffer
It is the physical deprivation and poverty that results from this kind of unequal distribution which virtually everyone finds objectionable	it be the physical deprivation and poverty that result from this kind of unequal distribution which virtually everyone find objectionable
That Locke found it so is illustrated by his Proviso requiring enough viz at least to avoid deprivation while we interpreted Locke to mean something much stronger than this by enough it certainly includes a prohibition on physical deprivation	that locke find it so be illustrate by his proviso require enough viz at least to avoid deprivation while we interpret locke to mean something much strong than this by enough it certainly include a prohibition on physical deprivation
Let us now state their view explicitly and concisely	let us now state their view explicitly and concisely
The HeldBarry Thesis The accumulation of property outside the state of nature in the hands of one person logically requires the denial of an equal amount of property to others lessening their stock of property by the amount accumulated by the first person	the heldbarry thesis the accumulation of property outside the state of nature in the hand of one person logically require the denial of a equal amount of property to others lessen their stock of property by the amount accumulate by the first person

That just is zerosum in the very same sense as Lord Bad s appropriation denied the appropriated land to Peasants Good Nice and Kind in the enclosure case set out above	that just be zerosum in the very same sense as lord bad s appropriation deny the appropriated land to peasant good nice and kind in the enclosure case set out above
Thus it is your being excluded in this way from enough land where there is nt unappropriated land for you to acquire which might lead to your suffering physical deprivation	thus it be your be exclude in this way from enough land where there be nt unappropriated land for you to acquire which might lead to your suffering physical deprivation
The kind of transfers of property contemplated by Held and Barry being based on the realproperty paradigm are zerosum	the kind of transfer of property contemplate by hold and barry be base on the realproperty paradigm be zerosum
What logical prerequisites must exist in order to have private property characterized by the realproperty paradigm Any property that can be held in private must be excludable as we saw with Blackacre above	what logical prerequisite must exist in order to have private property characterize by the realproperty paradigm any property that can be hold in private must be excludable as we see with blackacre above

It is also central to the legal conception of private property Of course the economist s and the lawyer s notions differ in that the former concerns the practical physical ability and therefore the cost to exclude while the latter has to do with the normative power to exclude	it be also central to the legal conception of private property of course the economist s and the lawyer s notion differ in that the former concern the practical physical ability and therefore the cost to exclude while the latter have to do with the normative power to exclude
As we saw above there is a closely related but distinct characteristic entailed by the zerosum conception of property which is often confused with excludability	as we see above there be a closely relate but distinct characteristic entail by the zerosum conception of property which be often confuse with excludability
If I claim Blackacre as my own excludability will insure that no one else can own use or enjoy without suitable permission that particular piece of land viz Blackacre	if i claim blackacre as my own excludability will insure that no one else can own use or enjoy without suitable permission that particular piece of land viz blackacre

This constitutes a very strong and I would say highly artificial presumption in favor of Held s and Barry s use of Locke s Proviso argument	this constitute a very strong and i would say highly artificial presumption in favor of hold s and barry s use of locke s proviso argument
Thus tangible personal property is subject to the objection that accumulation leads to deprivation ie I can only get more by denying an equal amount to others	thus tangible personal property be subject to the objection that accumulation lead to deprivation ie i can only get more by deny a equal amount to others

Property was created out of nothing but mental labor He did nt even need raw materials as the farmer needs land and seed or the potter needs clay	property be create out of nothing but mental labor he do nt even need raw material as the farmer need land and seed or the potter need clay
Of course he needed a pencil paper a drafting board and a slide rule my friend is an oldfashioned inventor	of course he need a pencil paper a drafting board and a slide rule my friend be a oldfashioned inventor
But these are more like tools	but these be more like tool
He needed no stuff with which to mix his labor	he need no stuff with which to mix his labor
Do my friend s patented ideas meet the exclusion condition required of all private property Yes they do for no one can use his invention without his approval for which he will normally charge a fee a royalty rather than rent but logically identical to one	do my friend be patent idea meet the exclusion condition require of all private property yes they do for no one can use his invention without his approval for which he will normally charge a fee a royalty rather than rent but logically identical to one
So exclusion is both practically possible and normatively effective	so exclusion be both practically possible and normatively effective
Indeed the machinery of the patent law is created precisely to enable him to exclude others from the appropriation or use of any of an inventor s patented ideas	indeed the machinery of the patent law be create precisely to enable him to exclude others from the appropriation or use of any of a inventor be patent idea
That ownership or use of that idea without his permission	that ownership or use of that idea without his permission
To be sure there are seventeen fewer unappropriated ideas available for me to appropriate than before my friend started thinking	to be sure there be seventeen fewer unappropriated idea available for me to appropriate than before my friend start think
But has that lowered the stock of unthoughtof and unappropriated ideas still to be thought up at all Certainly not	but have that lower the stock of unthoughtof and unappropriated idea still to be think up at all certainly not
The number of both notyetthoughtof and notyetappropriated ideas is at least practically unbounded if not infinite	the number of both notyetthoughtof and notyetappropriated idea be at least practically unbounded if not infinite
It was nt ever n and it is nt now n constraint	it be nt ever xxn and it be nt now xxn constraint
Indeed subtracting seventeen from the number of all the ideas which I could still think up and appropriate does not seem to decrease the total number	indeed subtract seventeen from the number of all the idea which i could still think up and appropriate do not seem to decrease the total number
This makes the arithmetic of ideas seem very similar to the arithmetic of aleph zero Thus the finitude condition is violated	this make the arithmetic of idea seem very similar to the arithmetic of aleph zero thus the finitude condition be violate
What about the zerosum condition itself Excludability is enough to ensure that I can not appropriate and can not use without permission any presently extant and patented ideas	what about the zerosum condition itself excludability be enough to ensure that i can not appropriate and can not use without permission any presently extant and patent idea
Moreover if I do receive a patent on an idea there is one fewer idea out of the finite number already thought up and in existence for others to own and use	moreover if i do receive a patent on a idea there be one fewer idea out of the finite number already think up and in existence for others to own and use
If we limit ourselves to the presently extant patented appropriated ideas they behave exactly like Blackacre ie in accord with the realproperty paradigm	if we limit ourselves to the presently extant patented appropriated idea they behave exactly like blackacre ie in accord with the realproperty paradigm
However patented ideas are not like real property without a frontier just because as we have seen there is a source of an infinite or indefinitely large number of new ideas which can be thought of appropriated ex nihilo merely by hard and creative thought	however patent idea be not like real property without a frontier just because as we have see there be a source of a infinite or indefinitely large number of new idea which can be think of appropriate ex nihilo merely by hard and creative think
I do not have to pay anyone for those new ideas and more importantly when I come up with one the number available to you is not thereby decreased	i do not have to pay anyone for those new idea and more importantly when i come up with one the number available to you be not thereby decrease

It is otherwise free as it should be if there is an inexhaustible supply presently unclaimed	it be otherwise free as it should be if there be a inexhaustible supply presently unclaimed
Of course issues of distributive justice implicit in the concerns of Held and Barry are not thereby solved for not all of us are intelligent enough or intelligent in the right way to think up ideas of sufficient novelty and value to be worth protection by patent or copyright	of course issue of distributive justice implicit in the concern of hold and barry be not thereby solve for not all of us be intelligent enough or intelligent in the right way to think up idea of sufficient novelty and value to be worth protection by patent or copyright
Thus we can not all be equal in access to resources	thus we can not all be equal in access to resource
What is even more disturbing for most of us if ideas so construed are the only inexhaustible source of wealth produced by labor is that some of us willing to labor might nonetheless have so little as to suffer physical privation	what be even more disturbing for most of us if idea so construe be the only inexhaustible source of wealth produce by labor be that some of us willing to labor might nonetheless have so little as to suffer physical privation
Held and Barry might also quite rightly point out that there are substantial transaction costs connected with obtaining patents and copyrights	hold and barry might also quite rightly point out that there be substantial transaction cost connect with obtain patent and copyright
Theoretically this can be construed as part of the cost of recording title rather the cost of perspective however it makes very little difference since	theoretically this can be construe as part of the cost of record title rather the cost of perspective however it make very little difference since

The availability of intellectual property may favor the industrious as Locke and the author prefer	the availability of intellectual property may favor the industrious as locke and the author prefer
But it also favors the intelligent and that is not obviously fair	but it also favor the intelligent and that be not obviously fair
Moreover as intelligence can be magnified by education and as the transaction cost of recording title to ideas can be high there is some tendency for such property to be more available to the rich or at least the welloff	moreover as intelligence can be magnify by education and as the transaction cost of record title to idea can be high there be some tendency for such property to be more available to the rich or at least the welloff
There is a response however for there is another source of unappropriated property which seems to be even more available to all than intellectual property	there be a response however for there be another source of unappropriated property which seem to be even more available to all than intellectual property
There is no doubt that the notions of the patent or the copyright constitute a different paradigm of property from that of real property in a nonfrontier situation	there be no doubt that the notion of the patent or the copyright constitute a different paradigm of property from that of real property in a nonfrontier situation
There also is no doubt that it fits the Lockean notion including the Proviso far	there also be no doubt that it fit the lockean notion including the proviso far

The numbers of bulldozers or bicycles or beer bottles are not unbounded in quite the same way as is intellectual property 	the number of bulldozer or bicycle or beer bottle be not unbounded in quite the same way as be intellectual property 
Certainly patents and copyrights are important in our economy but are they more important than all forms of tangible property both real and personal No they are not	certainly patent and copyright be important in our economy but be they more important than all form of tangible property both real and personal no they be not

This last point raises the second objection to the market as an institution appropriate to science given the employment of market mechanisms the value of a contribution to the development of science is disassociated from the external rewards that the institutions that support science assign to the contributor	this last point raise the second objection to the market as a institution appropriate to science give the employment of market mechanism the value of a contribution to the development of science be disassociate from the external reward that the institution that support science assign to the contributor
Because the market value of information and theories is instrumental and is at best only indirectly related to the significance a theory has to the internal development of science its rewards to the contributor to science are not properly related to the significance of the contribution	because the market value of information and theory be instrumental and be at best only indirectly relate to the significance a theory have to the internal development of science its reward to the contributor to science be not properly relate to the significance of the contribution

The egoist assumes a narrow range of goods the biggest share of money honors and bodily pleasures and asks how friends or virtues bring these goods	the egoist assume a narrow range of good the big share of money honor and bodily pleasure and ask how friend or virtue bring these good
In consequence where market mechanisms enter a particularsphere of life the pursuit of goods outside this narrow range of market goods is institutionally defined as an act of altruism	in consequence where market mechanism enter a particularsphere of life the pursuit of good outside this narrow range of market good be institutionally define as a act of altruism

However this term is understood systematic criticisms of the free enterprise system are either explicitly or implicitly criticisms of the privateproperty rights that constitute the framework of that system	however this term be understand systematic criticism of the free enterprise system be either explicitly or implicitly criticism of the privateproperty right that constitute the framework of that system
These rights can be understood as the positive legal rights that constitute actually existing economic systems but only insofar as these rights resemble those that would be found in the hypothetical libertarian society alluded to above	these right can be understand as the positive legal right that constitute actually existing economic system but only insofar as these right resemble those that would be find in the hypothetical libertarian society allude to above
Let us begin with a taxonomy of these criticisms	let us begin with a taxonomy of these criticism
The main function of any economic system is to produce and distribute exchangeable goods and services	the main function of any economic system be to produce and distribute exchangeable good and service
One important kind of complaint against the free enterprise system is that it does not do a very good job at this that is the system is inherently dysfunctional with respect to some range of goods or services	one important kind of complaint against the free enterprise system be that it do not do a very good job at this that is the system be inherently dysfunctional with respect to some range of good or service
The basic idea behind criticisms of this sort is that the system is not producing or distributing the relevant goods or services as efficiently as it could be	the basic idea behind criticism of this sort be that the system be not produce or distribute the relevant good or service as efficiently as it could be
These Efficiency come from a variety of sources	these efficiency come from a variety of source
Welfare economists often charge the freeenterprise system with market failures	welfare economist often charge the freeenterprise system with market failure
Market failures are defects of the free enterprise system associated with externalities or public goods	market failure be defect of the free enterprise system associate with externality or public good
Externalitites are positive or negative effects of voluntary transactions on noncontracting third parties	externalitites be positive or negative effect of voluntary transaction on noncontracting third party
The benefits from a vaccination program and the harms associated with industrial pollution are often cited as examples of positive and negative externalities respectively	the benefit from a vaccination program and the harm associate with industrial pollution be often cite as example of positive and negative externality respectively
The usual charge is that the free enterprise system overproduces goods associated with negative externalities and underproduces goods associated with positive externalities	the usual charge be that the free enterprise system overproduce good associate with negative externality and underproduces good associate with positive externality
For example production of a consumer good that pollutes the atmosphere is at a higher level than it would be if the manufacturer or the consumer had to compensate those who suffer from the pollution	for example production of a consumer good that pollute the atmosphere be at a high level than it would be if the manufacturer or the consumer have to compensate those who suffer from the pollution
Overproduction in this case is overproduction relative to what would take place in an ideal market system	overproduction in this case be overproduction relative to what would take place in a ideal market system
Similarly for underproduction of goods associated with positive externalities	similarly for underproduction of good associate with positive externality
An ideal market system is defined in terms of some very strong assumptions about perfect information welldefined property rights no monopoly there are no uncompensated externalities in this model of an economy	a ideal market system be define in terms of some very strong assumption about perfect information welldefined property right no monopoly there be no uncompensated externality in this model of a economy
In orthodox welfare economics an ideal market system serves as a kind of benchmark against which realworld systems are judged	in orthodox welfare economics a ideal market system serve as a kind of benchmark against which realworld system be judge
The reason for this is that it is a theorem of welfare economics that an ideal market system achieves a Pareto optimal allocation of resources producer and consumer goods this is a distribution in which no one can be made better off without someone else being made worse off	the reason for this be that it be a theorem of welfare economics that a ideal market system achieve a pareto optimal allocation of resource producer and consumer good this be a distribution in which no one can be make better off without someone else be make bad off
The main policy implication of this theorem according to orthodox thinking anyway is that realworld economic systems should be made more like an ideal market system to the extent that this feasible since this would result in distribution of goods and services more closely approximating Pareto optimality	the main policy implication of this theorem according to orthodox thinking anyway be that realworld economic system should be make more like a ideal market system to the extent that this feasible since this would result in distribution of good and service more closely approximate pareto optimality
For example if the state prohibits pollution above a certain level this directly or indirectly lowers production of the good in question this lower production is closer to the level of production that would occur in an ideal market system	for example if the state prohibit pollution above a certain level this directly or indirectly lower production of the good in question this low production be closer to the level of production that would occur in a ideal market system
This means that production is has achieved Pareto optimality	this mean that production be have achieve pareto optimality
For this reason a change in the system of property rights that results in movement toward a Pareto optimal allocation of goods and services is thought to represent an efficiency gain for the system	for this reason a change in the system of property right that result in movement toward a pareto optimal allocation of good and service be think to represent a efficiency gain for the system
A similar strategy is employed with public goods problems	a similar strategy be employ with public good problem
Public goods are defined in terms of nonexcludability or jointness of supply and nonrivalrous consumption	public good be define in terms of nonexcludability or jointness of supply and nonrivalrous consumption
In other words a public good is something nonpayers can not be feasibly excluded from consuming and consumption by one person does not diminish the quantity of the good available to others	in other word a public good be something nonpayers can not be feasibly exclude from consume and consumption by one person do not diminish the quantity of the good available to others
Commonly cited examples of public goods include lighthouses and national defense	commonly cite example of public good include lighthouse and national defense
It is claimed that public goods like goods associated with positive externalities tend to be underproduced in a free enterprise system because roughly of excludability problems	it be claim that public good like good associate with positive externality tend to be underproduced in a free enterprise system because roughly of excludability problem
As in the case of negative externalitites the solution to public goods problems is sought in governmental action	as in the case of negative externalitites the solution to public good problem be seek in governmental action
The state provides the good in question and forces everyone to contribute in virtue of the fact that the good is paid in theory free enterprise systems are inherently dysfunctional insofar as they suffer market failure that is problems associated with negative and positive externalities and public goods problems	the state provide the good in question and force everyone to contribute in virtue of the fact that the good be pay in theory free enterprise system be inherently dysfunctional insofar as they suffer market failure that is problem associate with negative and positive externality and public good problem
These failures are explained by reference to the system of property rights in the means of production characteristic of the free enterprise system	these failure be explain by reference to the system of property right in the mean of production characteristic of the free enterprise system
In the real world however market failures are mitigated by governmental action which is as it should be according to these critics of the free enterprise system	in the real world however market failure be mitigate by governmental action which be as it should be according to these critic of the free enterprise system
The state provides some public goods such as national defense and it reduces negative externalities by for example regulating pollution	the state provide some public good such as national defense and it reduce negative externality by for example regulate pollution
Nevertheless some negative externalities remain and not all public goods problems are solved	nevertheless some negative externality remain and not all public good problem be solve
But perfection is not to be expected	but perfection be not to be expect
Amelioration is however and that is what governmental action is supposed to deliver	amelioration be however and that be what governmental action be supposed to deliver
Charges of market failure constitute one important type of Efficiency Criticism of the free enterprise system	charge of market failure constitute one important type of efficiency criticism of the free enterprise system
Two other types of Efficiency Criticisms are worth mentioning	two other type of efficiency criticism be worth mention
One concerns inefficiencies associated with monopolistic of oligopolistic pricing	one concern inefficiency associate with monopolistic of oligopolistic pricing
The charge is prices are higher and production levels are lower than they would be in an ideal market system which by definition has many suppliers or producers for any given product perfect competition	the charge be price be high and production level be low than they would be in a ideal market system which by definition have many supplier or producer for any given product perfect competition
This market imperfection is supposed to be cured by antitrust policy or by direct governmental regulation of prices or both	this market imperfection be supposed to be cure by antitrust policy or by direct governmental regulation of price or both
The cure may not be complete but it is better than the disease at least according to these critics of the free enterprise system	the cure may not be complete but it be better than the disease at least according to these critic of the free enterprise system
A final type of Efficiency Criticism is that the free enterprise system has certain inherent macrolevel instabilities which are made manifest in the business cycle	a final type of efficiency criticism be that the free enterprise system have certain inherent macrolevel instability which be make manifest in the business cycle
Keynesians for example maintain that the free enterprise system can and has suffered persistent and chronic unemployment of human resources because of insufficient aggregate demand	keynesian for example maintain that the free enterprise system can and have suffer persistent and chronic unemployment of human resource because of insufficient aggregate demand
As in the case of other Efficiency Criticisms state action eg through fiscal or monetary policy is advocated to correct these perceived defects of the free enterprise system	as in the case of other efficiency criticism state action eg through fiscal or monetary policy be advocate to correct these perceived defect of the free enterprise system
These Efficiency Criticisms have provided a theoretical justification for much if not most century	these efficiency criticism have provide a theoretical justification for much if not most century
What all these criticisms have in common is a charge that the free enterprise system a system of private property rights in the means of production is inherently dysfunctional in one way or another	what all these criticism have in common be a charge that the free enterprise system a system of private property right in the mean of production be inherently dysfunctional in one way or another
The remedy for the problems thus identified is always state action	the remedy for the problem thus identify be always state action

The thinking is that if government can change the rules of the free enterprise system or otherwise intervene so that the system s distribution of goods and services more closely approximates Pareto optimality it should do so	the thinking be that if government can change the rule of the free enterprise system or otherwise intervene so that the system s distribution of good and service more closely approximate pareto optimality it should do so
After all it is the rational thing to do on the collective level	after all it be the rational thing to do on the collective level

Antitrust legislation for example did not await midtwentieth century developments in welfare economics	antitrust legislation for example do not await midtwentieth century development in welfare economics
Nevertheless much government regulation and intervention in the free enterprise system has been advocated the system has some inherently dysfunctional features which can be corrected or ameliorated by governmental action that in some way restricts private property rights	nevertheless much government regulation and intervention in the free enterprise system have be advocate the system have some inherently dysfunctional feature which can be correct or ameliorate by governmental action that in some way restrict private property right

The Individual Difference Fallacy is likely to be an especially serious problem for such scales because the items could function as a disguised measure of personality or other psychological characteristics of individuals rather than a true environmental measure	the individual difference fallacy be likely to be a especially serious problem for such scale because the item could function as a disguised measure of personality or other psychological characteristic of individual rather than a true environmental measure
Accordingly Richards used hypothetical data to argue that no analysis using individuals as the units is capable of distinguishing between a valid environmental measure and a disguised test of personality	accordingly richards use hypothetical data to argue that no analysis use individual as the unit be capable of distinguish between a valid environmental measure and a disguised test of personality
Only analyses using environmental settings as the units could make this distinction	only analysis use environmental setting as the unit could make this distinction

The SplitSample Correlation is an analog of a splithalf test reliability based on odd items vs even items	the splitsample correlation be a analog of a splithalf test reliability base on odd item vs even item
To compute one assigns numbers from to n to the individuals within each setting and computes two summary scores for that setting one based on individuals assigned odd numbers and the other on individuals assigned even numbers then summary scores are correlated across environmental settings	to compute one assign number from to xxn to the individual within each setting and compute two summary score for that setting one base on individual assign odd number and the other on individual assign even number then summary score be correlate across environmental setting
Alpha coefficients based on individuals as the units of analysis necessarily from observed or random settings confirming that no individual level analysis can throw any light at all on the setting level reliability of environmental assessment scales	alpha coefficient base on individual as the unit of analysis necessarily from observed or random setting confirm that no individual level analysis can throw any light at all on the setting level reliability of environmental assessment scale
The setting level Alphas for observed settings were quite substantial but so were the Alphas for random settings	the setting level alpha for observed setting be quite substantial but so be the alpha for random setting
Thus a standard reliability analysis with settings as the units also may not distinguish clearly between a valid environmental measure and a disguised measure of personality	thus a standard reliability analysis with setting as the unit also may not distinguish clearly between a valid environmental measure and a disguised measure of personality
The SplitSample Correlations however were high for observed settings but low for random settings	the splitsample correlation however be high for observed setting but low for random setting

Although some students may have assessed more than one classroom the sets of individuals assessing the various classrooms were essentially independent	although some student may have assess more than one classroom the set of individual assess the various classroom be essentially independent
Only classrooms with at least respondents were deemed eligible for this study	only classroom with at least respondent be deem eligible for this study

The numbers for both individual assessments and for environmental settings are large enough to provide highly stable estimates of item statistics	the number for both individual assessment and for environmental setting be large enough to provide highly stable estimate of item statistics
Analyses were based on student responses to abbreviated fouritem versions of six of the Classroom Environment Scales developed by Moos Trickett 	analysis be base on student response to abbreviated fouritem version of six of the classroom environment scale develop by moos trickett 
Therefore the total number of items was 	therefore the total number of item be 
Moos and consist of truefalse questions about the characteristics of the classroom	moos and consist of truefalse question about the characteristic of the classroom
The following specific scales were included Involvement Affiliation Teacher Support Task Orientation Order and Organization Rule Clarity	the following specific scale be include involvement affiliation teacher support task orientation order and organization rule clarity
The psychometric properties of the items in these six scales were examined for three different units of analysis	the psychometric property of the item in these six scale be examine for three different unit of analysis
First individuals ie the student assessments were used as the units of analysis	first individual ie the student assessment be use as the unit of analysis
For this analysis each item was scored or with being assigned to the response associated with higher standing on the characteristic implied by the scale title	for this analysis each item be score or with be assign to the response associate with high standing on the characteristic imply by the scale title
Second observed environmental settings ie the classrooms were used as the units of analysis	second observe environmental setting ie the classroom be use as the unit of analysis
The summary score for each observed setting or classroom or each item was the mean of the item scores for students in that classroom	the summary score for each observed setting or classroom or each item be the mean of the item score for student in that classroom
Because the item scores were scored or these setting summary scores can be interpreted as the probability that an individual in that setting would respond artificial or randomized settings were used as units of analysis	because the item score be score or these set summary score can be interpret as the probability that a individual in that setting would respond artificial or randomize setting be use as unit of analysis
These settings were constructed by sorting the individual assessments into a random order and then dividing them into groups with the same numbers of subjects as the observed classrooms	these setting be construct by sort the individual assessment into a random order and then divide them into group with the same number of subject as the observed classroom
The summary score for each artificial setting on each item was the mean of the item scores for individuals randomly assigned to it	the summary score for each artificial setting on each item be the mean of the item score for individual randomly assign to it
The first step in the statistical analysis was to compute the adjusted partwhole correlation coefficient or item validity between each item and total score on the scale of which it was a part	the first step in the statistical analysis be to compute the adjusted partwhole correlation coefficient or item validity between each item and total score on the scale of which it be a part
The adjustment eliminated the contribution of the item itself to the total score so each adjusted correlation is mathematically equivalent to the zeroorder correlation between the item in question and the total of the other three items in its scale	the adjustment eliminate the contribution of the item itself to the total score so each adjusted correlation be mathematically equivalent to the zeroorder correlation between the item in question and the total of the other three item in its scale
Therefore statistical tests for zero order correlations were applied to these coefficients	therefore statistical test for zero order correlation be apply to these coefficient
The reliability procedures included in the SPSSX statistical package SPSS were used in computing these correlations	the reliability procedure include in the spssx statistical package spss be use in compute these correlation
In addition the SplitSample Correlation Richards was computed for each item	in addition the splitsample correlation richards be compute for each item
SplitSample Correlations for items directly address the central issue of whether or not different individuals agree about the characteristics of given settings on given items	splitsample correlation for item directly address the central issue of whether or not different individual agree about the characteristic of given setting on given item
Table summarizes the statistics for individual items	table summarize the statistics for individual item
Because the numbers of individuals and settings were relatively large even rather small correlations were nominally significant	because the number of individual and setting be relatively large even rather small correlation be nominally significant
Accordingly the absolute magnitude of the various statistics appeared more relevant than their significance level and Table summarizes the central tendency and dispersion of the various statistics across the items	accordingly the absolute magnitude of the various statistics appear more relevant than their significance level and table summarize the central tendency and dispersion of the various statistics across the item
The mean in Table for each statistic except the SplitSample Correlation for random settings would be significant beyond the level if it were a zeroorder correlation based on the numbers of individuals and settings for this study	the mean in table for each statistic except the splitsample correlation for random setting would be significant beyond the level if it be a zeroorder correlation base on the number of individual and setting for this study
The average adjusted partwhole correlation for individuals was typical for item analysis research but necessarily was identical whether the individuals came from the observed settings or from the random settings	the average adjust partwhole correlation for individual be typical for item analysis research but necessarily be identical whether the individual come from the observed setting or from the random setting
This fact provides confirmation that item analyses using individuals items measuring the characteristics of settings and items measuring the characteristics of individuals	this fact provide confirmation that item analysis use individual item measure the characteristic of setting and item measure the characteristic of individual
The average partwhole correlation for observed settings was both fairly high and somewhat higher than the individual level correlation	the average partwhole correlation for observed setting be both fairly high and somewhat high than the individual level correlation
At first glance this result would seem to indicate that to some degree these items were measuring the characteristics of settings	at first glance this result would seem to indicate that to some degree these item be measure the characteristic of setting
Surprisingly however the average partwhole item correlation for random settings also was fairly high and of approximately the same magnitude as the correlation for individuals	surprisingly however the average partwhole item correlation for random setting also be fairly high and of approximately the same magnitude as the correlation for individual
It is unclear why this was the case for theoretically this correlation should be close to zero Richards F tests at the scale level confirmed the adequacy of the randomization Richards 	it be unclear why this be the case for theoretically this correlation should be close to zero richards f test at the scale level confirm the adequacy of the randomization richards 
One possible explanation is that randomization does not absolutely equate settings but merely insures that only chance differences persist	one possible explanation be that randomization do not absolutely equate setting but merely insure that only chance difference persist
Therefore the correlation for random settings will approximate the correlation for randomly chosen individuals	therefore the correlation for random setting will approximate the correlation for randomly choose individual
Whatever the explanation these results clearly indicate that setting level partwhole correlations also can not distinguish unequivocally between items measuring setting characteristics and items measuring settings was fairly substantial however a clear indication that to some degree these items were measuring setting characteristics	whatever the explanation these result clearly indicate that set level partwhole correlation also can not distinguish unequivocally between item measure setting characteristic and item measure setting be fairly substantial however a clear indication that to some degree these item be measure setting characteristic
More important the average SplitSample Correlation for random settings was low	more important the average splitsample correlation for random setting be low
Thus the SplitSample Correlation which was designed specifically for environmental measures appeared capable of distinguishing items which at least in part were measuring setting characteristics from items measuring only individual differences	thus the splitsample correlation which be design specifically for environmental measure appear capable of distinguishing item which at least in part be measure setting characteristic from item measure only individual difference
At the same time both theoretical considerations Richards and the typical properties of ecological correlations Robinson suggest that the SplitSample Correlations for items that are measuring only setting characteristics should be higher than the Correlations obtained in this study	at the same time both theoretical consideration richards and the typical property of ecological correlation robinson suggest that the splitsample correlation for item that be measure only set characteristic should be high than the correlation obtain in this study
Indeed the SplitSample Correlation should be for a pure environmental item with no measurement error Richards 	indeed the splitsample correlation should be for a pure environmental item with no measurement error richards 
The relatively low value obtained here suggests that while these items were to a degree measuring the characteristics of settings to an equal or larger degree they were measuring the characteristics of individuals	the relatively low value obtain here suggest that while these item be to a degree measure the characteristic of setting to a equal or large degree they be measure the characteristic of individual
This conclusion is supported by the results obtained previously at	this conclusion be support by the result obtain previously at
The results confirm the results of an earlier study of scale reliabilities Richards and suggest that substantial changes are needed in the itemselection procedures typically used to construct environmental assessment scales	the result confirm the result of a early study of scale reliability richards and suggest that substantial change be need in the itemselection procedure typically use to construct environmental assessment scale
The typical procedure has been to select items on the basis of item statistics for individuals frequently individuals within a single setting	the typical procedure have be to select item on the basis of item statistics for individual frequently individual within a single setting
This procedure not only is incapable of identifying items that measure the characteristics of environmental settings but also is virtually guaranteed to select items that largely or entirely measure individual differences	this procedure not only be incapable of identify item that measure the characteristic of environmental setting but also be virtually guarantee to select item that largely or entirely measure individual difference
Therefore item analyses based on individuals should be eschewed in future environmental research even as a first step and reports based on such analyses should no longer be welcome in scientific journals	therefore item analysis base on individual should be eschew in future environmental research even as a first step and report base on such analysis should no long be welcome in scientific journal
Even in the initial stages of scale construction environmental settings should be the units of analysis in computing item statistics including item characteristic curves	even in the initial stage of scale construction environmental setting should be the unit of analysis in computing item statistics including item characteristic curve
Moreover the number of settings must be relatively large perhaps as large as the minimum number of individuals needed for a conventional item analysis	moreover the number of setting must be relatively large perhaps as large as the minimum number of individual need for a conventional item analysis
Thus future research aimed at more complex and more expensive than has been customary	thus future research aim at more complex and more expensive than have be customary
Consequently such research will be more difficult	consequently such research will be more difficult
This greater difficulty appears to be the necessary price of obtaining scales that measure environmental characteristics however and researchers should not allow such difficulty to deter them from using the proper units of analysis	this great difficulty appear to be the necessary price of obtain scale that measure environmental characteristic however and researcher should not allow such difficulty to deter them from use the proper unit of analysis
It will not be sufficient however simply to select items on the basis of adjusted partwhole correlations with environmental settings as the units of analysis	it will not be sufficient however simply to select item on the basis of adjusted partwhole correlation with environmental setting as the unit of analysis
Such correlations will be substantial for items that measure environmental characteristics but they also can be substantial for items that reflect only individual differences	such correlation will be substantial for item that measure environmental characteristic but they also can be substantial for item that reflect only individual difference
The itemlevel SplitSample Correlation is needed to distinguish between these two kinds of items	the itemlevel splitsample correlation be need to distinguish between these two kind of item
In constructing environmental scales therefore researchers should select items that have both a high setting level partwhole correlation and a high SplitSample Correlation preferably higher than the SplitSample Correlations obtained here	in construct environmental scale therefore researcher should select item that have both a high setting level partwhole correlation and a high splitsample correlation preferably high than the splitsample correlation obtain here
Because items have never been selected in this way no information currently is available that would guide researchers in constructing such items	because item have never be select in this way no information currently be available that would guide researcher in construct such item
As experience accumulates with possible to identify in advance the type of items most likely to meet both selection criteria	as experience accumulate with possible to identify in advance the type of item most likely to meet both selection criteria
It then would become easier to construct environmental assessment scales that minimize individual differences contamination	it then would become easy to construct environmental assessment scale that minimize individual difference contamination
