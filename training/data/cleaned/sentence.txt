Life and Letters
I do nt remember hearing the phrase white guilt very much before the mids
Growing up black in the s I never had the impression that whites were much disturbed by guilt when it came to blacks
When I would stray into the wrong restaurant in pursuit of a hamburger it did nt occur to me that the waitress was unduly troubled by guilt when she asked me to leave
I can see now that possibly she was but then all I saw was her irritability at having to carry out so unpleasant a task
If there was guilt it was mine for having made an imposition of myself
I can remember feeling a certain sympathy for such people as if I was victimizing them by drawing them out of an innocent anonymity into the unasked for role of racial policemen
Occasionally they came right out and asked me to feel sorry for them
A caddymaster at a country club told my brother and me that he was this white club and that we should try to understand his position put yourselves in my shoes
Our color had brought this man anguish and if a part of that anguish was guilt it was not as immediate to me as my own guilt
I smiled at the man to let him know he should nt feel bad and then began my long walk home
Certainly I also judge him a coward but in that era his cowardice was something I had to absorb
In the s particularly the blackisbeautiful late s this absorption of another s cowardice was no longer necessary
The lines of moral power like plates in the earth had shifted
White guilt became so palpable you could see it on people
At the time what it looked like to my eyes was a remarkable loss of authority
And what whites lost in authority blacks gained
You can not feel guilty about anyone without giving away power to them
Suddenly this huge vulnerability had opened had the power to step right into it
In fact black power all but demanded that you do so
What shocked me in the late s after the helplessness I had felt in the fifties was that guilt had changed the nature of the white man s burden from the administration of inferiors to the uplift of equals from the obligations of dominance to the urgencies of repentance
I think what made the difference between the fifties and sixties at least as far as white guilt was concerned was that whites underwent an archetypal Fall
Because of the immense turmoil of the civil rights movement and later the blackpower movement whites were confronted for more than a decade with their willingness to participate in or comply with the oppression of blacks their indifference to human suffering and denigration their capacity to abide evil for their own benefit and in the defiance of their own sacred principles
The Civil Rights Bill that bestowed equality under the law on blacks was also in Had white society not been wrong there would have been no need for such a bill
In this bill the nation acknowledged its fallenness its lack of racial innocence and confronted the incriminating selfknowledge that it had rationalized for many years a flagrant injustice
Denial is a common way of handling guilt but in the s there was little will left for denial except in the most recalcitrant whites
With this defense lost there was really only one road back to innocence through actions and policies that would bring redemption
In the s the need for white redemption from racial guilt became the most powerful yet unspoken element in America s socialpolicymaking process first giving rise to the Great Society and then to a series of programs policies and laws that sought to make black equality and restitution a national mission
Once America could no longer deny its guilt it went after redemption or at least the look of redemption and did so with a vengeance
Yet today some twenty many measures the gap between blacks and whites is widening rather than narrowing
A University of Chicago study indicates that segregation is more entrenched in American cities today than ever imagined
A National Research Council study notes the status of blacks relative to whites in housing and education has stagnated or regressed since the early seventies
A followup to the famous Kerner Commission Report warns that blacks are as much at risk today of becoming a nation within a nation as we were twenty years ago when the original report was made
I think the white need for redemption has contributed to this tragic situation by shaping our policies regarding blacks in ways that may deliver the look of innocence to society and its institutions but that do very little actually to uplift blacks
The specific effect of this hidden need has been to bend social policy more toward reparation for black oppression than toward the much harder and more mundane work of black uplift and development
Rather than facilitate the development of blacks to achieve parity is a good example have tended to give blacks special entitlements that in many cases are of no use because blacks lack the development that would put us in a position to take advantage of them
I think the reason there has been more entitlement than development is along with black power the unacknowledged white need for redemption not true redemption which would have concentrated policy on black development but the appearance of redemption which requires only that society in the name of development seem to be paying back its former victims with preferences
One of the effects of entitlements I believe has been to encourage in blacks a dependency both on entitlements and on the white guilt that generates them
Even when it serves ideal justice bounty from another man s guilt weakens
While this is not the only factor in black stagnation and regression I believe it is one very potent factor
It is easy enough to say that white guilt too often has the effect what exactly is this guilt and how does it work in American life
I think white guilt in its broad sense springs from a knowledge of illgotten advantage
More precisely it comes from the juxtaposition of this knowledge with the inevitable gratitude one feels for being white rather than black in America
Given the moral instincts of human beings it is all but impossible to enjoy an illgotten advantage much less to feel at least secretly grateful for it without consciously or unconsciously experiencing guilt
If as Kierkegaard writes innocence is ignorance then guilt must always involve knowledge
White Americans know that their historical advantage comes from the subjugation of an entire people
So even for whites today for whom racism is anathema there is no escape from the knowledge that makes for guilt
Racial guilt simply accompanies the condition of being white in America
I do not believe that this guilt is a crushing anguish for most whites but I do believe it constitutes a that is a thread in white life sometimes felt sometimes not but ever present as a potential feeling
In the late s almost any black could charge this vulnerability with enough current for a white person to feel it
I had a friend who had developed this activity into a sort of specialty
I do nt think he meant to be mean though certainly he was mean
I think he was in that hyperbolic era exhilarated by the discovery that his race which had long been a liability now gave him a certain edge that white guilt was the true force behind black power
To feel this power he would sometimes set up what he called race experiments
Once I watched him stop a white businessman in the men s room of a large hotel and convince him to increase his tip to the black attendant from one to twenty dollars
My friend s tactic was very simple even corny
Out of the attendant s earshot he asked the man elderly and very dark man in a starched white smock that made the skin on his neck and face look as leathery as a turtle s
He sat listlessly pathetically on a straightbacked chair next to a small table on which sat a stack of hand towels and a silver plate for tips
Since the attendant offered no service whatever beyond the handing out of towels one could only conclude the hotel management offered his lowly presence as flattery to their patrons as an opportunity for that easy noblesse oblige that could reassure even the harried and weary traveling salesman of his superior station
My friend was quick to make this point to the businessman and to say that no white man would do in this job
But when the businessman put the single back in his wallet and took out a five my friend only sneered
Did he understand the tragedy of a life spent this way of what it must be like to earn one s paltry living as a symbol of inferiority And did he ironically he had just spent the day trying to sell a printing press to the Black Muslims for their newspaper Mohammed Speaks was connected to the deprivation of this man and others like him
But then my friend made a mistake that ended the game
In the heat of argument which until then had only been playfully challenging he inadvertently mentioned his father
This stopped the victim cold and his eyes turned inward
What about your father the businessman asked
My friend replied He had a hard life that s all
How did he have a hard life the businessman asked
Now my friend was on the defensive
I knew he did not get along with his father a bitter man who worked nights in a factory and demanded that the house be dark and silent all day
My friend blamed his father s bitterness on racism but I knew he had not meant to exploit his own pain in this silly experiment
did nt know how to get out of the situation without losing face
Now caught in his own trap he did what he least wanted to do
He gave forth the rage he truly felt to a white stranger in a public men s room
My father never had a chance he said with the kind of anger that could easily turn to tears
He never had a freakin chance
Your father had all the goddamn chances and you know he did
You sell printing presses to black people and make thousands and your father probably lives down in Fat City Florida all because you re white
On and on he went in this vein using against all that was honorable in him his own profound racial pain to extract a flash of guilt from a white man he did nt even know
He got more than a flash
The businessman was touched
His eyes became mournful and finally he simply said You He took a twenty dollar bill from his wallet and walked over and dropped it in the old man s tip plate
When he was gone my friend and I could not look at the old man nor could we look at each other
It is obvious that this was a rather shameful encounter for all concerned my friend and I as his silent accomplice trading on our racial pain tampering with a stranger for no reason and the stranger then buying his way out of the situation for twenty dollars a sum that was generous by one count and cheap by another
It was not an encounter of people but of historical grudges and guilts
Yet when I think about it now twenty years later I see that it had all the elements of a paradigm that I believe has been very much at the heart of racial policymaking in America since the s
My friend did two things that made this businessman vulnerable to his guilt that brought his guilt into man in touch with his own knowledge of his illgotten advantage as a white
The effect of this was to disallow the man any pretense of racial innocence to let him know that even if he was not the sort of white who used the word nigger around the dinner table he still had reason to feel racial guilt
But as disarming as this might have been it was too abstract to do much more than crack open this man s vulnerability to expose him to the logic of white guilt
This was the fivedollar intellectual sort of guilt
The twenty dollars required something more visceral
In achieving this the second thing my friend did was something he had not intended to do something that ultimately brought him as much shame as he was doling out He made a display of his own racial pain and anger
What brought him shame was not the pain and anger but his trading on them for what turned out to be a mere twenty bucks
man s knowledge of illgotten advantage to give credibility and solidity to it by putting a face on it
Here was human testimony a young black beside himself at the thought of his father s racially constricted life
The pain of one man evidenced the knowledge of the other
When the businessman listened to my friend s pain his racial guilt normally only one source of guilt lying dormant among others was called out like a neglected debt he would finally have to settle
An illgotten advantage is not hard to bear it can be marked up to fate until it touches the genuine human pain it has brought into the world
This is the pain that hardens guilty knowledge
Such knowledge is a powerful influence when it becomes conscious
What makes it so powerful is the element of fear that guilt always carries the fear of what the guilty knowledge says about us
Guilt makes us afraid for ourselves and thus generates as much selfpreoccupation as concern for others
The nature the reestablishment of good feeling about oneself
In this sense the fear for the self that is buried in all guilt is a pressure toward selfishness
It can lead us to put our own need for innocence above our concern for the problem that made us feel guilt in the first place
But this fear for the self does not only inspire selfishness it also becomes a pressure to escape the guiltinducing situation
When selfishness and escapism are at work we are no longer interested in the source of our guilt and therefore no longer concerned with an authentic redemption from it
Then we only want the look of redemption the gesture of concern that will give us the appearance of innocence and escape from the situation
Obviously the businessman did not put twenty dollars in the tip plate because he thought it would uplift black Americans
He did it selfishly for the appearance of concern and for the escape it afforded him
This is not to say that guilt is never the right motive it is a very dangerous one because of its tendency to draw us into selfpreoccupation and escapism
Guilt is a civilizing emotion when the fear for the self that it carries is contained a containment that allows guilt to be more selfless and that makes genuine concern possible
I think this was the kind of guilt that along with the other forces made the Civil Rights Bill possible
But since then I believe too many of our social policies related to race have been shaped by the fearful underside of guilt
Black power evoked white guilt and made it a force in American institutions very much in the same way as my friend brought it to life in the businessman
Few people volunteer for guilt
Usually others make us feel it
It was the expression of black anger and pain that hardened the guilty knowledge of white illgotten advantage
And black power whether from militant fringe groups the civil rights establishment or big city political campaigns knew exactly the kind of white guilt of white guilt in which whites fear for their own decency and innocence it wanted the guilt of white selfpreoccupation and escapism
Always at the heart of black power in whatever form has been a profound anger at what was done to blacks and an equally profound feeling that there should be reparations
But a sober white guilt in which fear for the self is still contained seeks a strict fairness the Civil Rights Bill that guaranteed equality under the law
It is of little value when one is after more than fairness
So black power made its mission to have whites fear for their innocence to feel a visceral guilt from which they would have to seek a more profound redemption
In such redemption was the possibility of black reparation
Black power upped the ante on white guilt
With black power all of the elements of the hidden paradigm that shape America s racerelated social policy were in place
Knowledge of illgotten advantage could now be shown and deepened by black power redeem themselves by offering more than fairness by offering forms of reparation and compensation for past injustice
I believe this bent our policies toward racial entitlements at the expense of racial development
In one of the assurances Senator Hubert Humphrey and others had to give Congress to get the landmark Civil Rights Bill passed was that the bill would not in any way require employers to use racial preferences to rectify racial imbalances
But this was before the explosion of black power in the late s before the hidden paradigm was set in motion
After black power racial preferences became the order of the day
If this paradigm brought blacks entitlements it also brought the continuation of the most profound problem in American society the invisibility of blacks as a people
The white guilt that this paradigm elicits is the kind of guilt that preoccupies whites with their own innocence and pressures them toward escapism twenty dollars in the plate and out the door
With this guilt as opposed to the contained guilt of need for quick redemption
Blacks then become a means to this redemption and as such they must be seen as generally less than others
Their needs are special unique different
They are seen exclusively along the dimension of their victimization so that they become different people with whom whites can negotiate entitlements but never fully see as people like themselves
Guilt that preoccupies people with their own innocence blinds them to those who make them feel guilty
This of course is not racism and yet it has the same effect as racism since it makes blacks something of a separate species for whom normal standards and values do not automatically apply
Nowhere is this more evident today than in American universities
At some of America s most elite universities administrators have granted concessions in response to black student demands black power that all but sanction racial separatism on campus black theme dorms black student unions black yearbooks believe administrators sincerely believe in these separatist concessions
Most of them are liberals who see racial separatism as wrong
But black student demands pull administrators into the paradigm of selfpreoccupied white guilt whereby they seek a quick redemption by offering special entitlements that go beyond fairness
As a result black students become all but invisible to them
Though blacks have the lowest grade point average of any racial group in American universities administrators never sit down with them and demand in kind that black students bring their grades up to par
The paradigm of white guilt makes the real problems of black students secondary to the need for white redemption
It also cuts administrators off from their own values which would most certainly discourage racial separatism and encourage higher academic performance for black students
Lastly it makes for escapist policies
There is no difference between giving black students a separate lounge and leaving twenty dollars in the tip plate on the way out the door
What demonstrates more than anything else the degree to by this paradigm is their refusal to lead black students to tell them what they honestly think to insist that they perform at a higher academic level and to ask them to integrate themselves fully into campus life
This marks the difference between selfpreoccupied guilt and the guilt of genuine concern where fear for one s innocence is contained
The former grants entitlements as a means to easy innocence and escape from judgment the latter refuses the entanglements and blindness of selfconcerned guilt and out of honest concern demands black development
Escapist racial policies policies where institutions favor black entitlement over development because of a preoccupation with their own innocence have I believe a dispiriting effect on blacks
Such policies have the effect of transforming whites from victimizers into patronizers and keeping blacks where they have always been dependent on the largesse of whites
This was made evident in a famous statement by President Lyndon Johnson at Howard University in 
You do not take a person who for years bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say You re free to compete with others and justly believe that you have been fair
On its surface this seems to be the most reasonable of statements but on closer examination one can clearly see how it deflects the emphasis away from black responsibility and toward white responsibility
The actors in this statement you whites do not take a person blacks are whites blacks are the passive recipients of white action
The former victimizers are challenged now to be patrons but where is the black challenge This is really a statement to and about white people their guilt their responsibility and their road to redemption
Not only does it not enunciate a black mission but it sees blacks only on the dimension of their victimization hobbled by chains and casts them once again into the role of receivers of white beneficence
Nowhere in this utterance does President Johnson show blacks to run fast once they get to the starting line
This statement which launched Johnson s Great Society had the two everpresent signposts of white guilt white selfpreoccupation and black invisibility
White guilt has influenced many of America s racial policies toward a paternalism that makes it difficult for blacks to find their true mettle or to develop a faith in their own capacity to run as fast as others
The most vivid examples of this are the many forms of preferential treatment that come under the heading of affirmative action an escapist racial policy I believe that offers entitlements rather than development to blacks
A preference is not a training program it teaches no skills instills no values
It only makes a color a passport
But the worst aspect of racial preferences is that they encourage dependency on entitlements rather than on our own initiative a situation that has already led many blacks to believe that we can not have fairness without entitlements
Here one falls into Orwellian doublespeak confusion I believe is an unspoken black doubt about our ability to compete that is covered over by a preoccupation with racial discrimination
Since there are already laws to protect us against discrimination preferences only impute a certain helplessness to blacks that diminishes our selfesteem
The selfpreoccupied form of white guilt that is behind racial preferences always makes us lower so that we can be lifted up
Recently Pennsylvania State University launched a program that pays black students for improving their grades a C to C average brings and anything higher brings 
Here is the sort of guilty kindness that kills
What kind of selfrespect is a black student going to have as he or she reaches out to take for C work when many white students would be embarrassed by so average a performance What better way to drive home the nail of inferiority What more Pavlovian system of conditioning blacks to dependency than shelling out cash for grades Here black students learn to hustle their victimization rather than overcome it while Not all preferential treatment is this insidious but the same dynamic is always at work when skin color brings entitlement
I think effective racial policies can only come from the sort of white guilt where fear for the self is contained so that genuine concern can ultimately emerge
The test for this healthy guilt is simply a heartfelt feeling of concern without any compromise of one s highest values and principles
But how can whites reach this more selfless form of guilt I believe the only way is to slacken one s grip on innocence
Guilt has always been the lazy man s way to innocence I feel guilt because I am innocent and guilt confirms my innocence
It is the compulsion to think always of ourselves as innocent that binds us to selfpreoccupied guilt
Whites in general and particularly those public and private insitutions not necessarily white that make racial policy must not be so preoccupied with their image of innocence or put another way their public relations of good intentions
in racial matters where blacks are viewed simply as American citizens who deserve complete fairness and in some cases developmental assistance but in no case special entitlements based on color
We need social policies that attack poverty rather than black poverty and that instill those values that make for selfreliance
The white message to blacks must be America hurt you badly and that is wrong but entitlements only prolong the hurt while development overcomes it
Selfish white guilt is really selfimportance
It has no humility and it asks for an unreasonable egotistical innocence
Nothing diminishes a black more than this sort of guilt in a white which to my mind amounts to a sort of moral colonialism
We used to say in the s that at least in the South you knew where you stood
I always thought this was a little foolish since I did nt like where I stood there
But I think one of the things we meant by this at the time was that the South had very liberating in an ironical sort of way
It meant there would be no entangling complications with white need
It gave us back ourselves
The selfishly guilty white person is drawn to what blacks least like in themselves their suffering victimization and dependency
This is no good for anyone black or white
By Shelby Steele
SHELBY STEELE is an associate professor of English at San Jose State University
His book The Content of Our Character A New Vision of Race in America will be published this August by St Martin s Press
Section Life and Letters
The prince of wales in his speeches and book A Vision for Britain attacking modernist architects for buildings they have put up in the postwar years in Britain has aroused an uproar among architects
One writer in Architectural Review the leading British architectural journal even finds the source of the Prince s taste in the architecture of Nazi Germany
He reproduces some pictures of new housing from a German publicity handout of and sure enough they show singlefamily homes on their own little plots
Because the Nazis preferred singlefamily houses to apartmenthome blocks he finds a precedent for the Prince
Of course we find the same preference in Pare Lorentz s famous movie The City made for the New York World s Fair in or in the books and articles of the reformers Clarence Stein and Lewis Mumford advocating planned communities of low density for families
And these were no Nazis
But architects give the Prince no takes the Prince to task for colonialism racism and imperialism because he likes classical architecture and would prefer to see more classical elements in contemporary building
In this storm of denunciation the Prince can only find satisfaction in the fact that the ordinary people seem to agree with him and that his critics are hysterical
Which raises a paradox How is it possible that modernist architecture which began with deep social concerns and one of whose themes was proper housing for workers to improve their lot now requires an elitist defense arguing that only properly qualified professionally trained experts should discuss and criticize architecture How did a socially concerned architecture turn out to be condemned fifty years later as soulless bureaucratic and inhuman a critique that receives wide acceptance by ordinary folk who have enthusiastically and overwhelmingly applauded the Prince s attacks on contemporary architecture and by many architects and planners as well
It was in the thirties that modern ideas in architecture first began to filter back Americans returning from Europe began to bring us news of the modern movement
Some of them were mostly interested in the new stripped down unornamented functional aesthetic forms but others were more interested in housing for workers
Catherine Bauer s Modern Housing had a great influence on concerned architects on planners and on the early public housing movement
She brought back pictures of the new housing being built in Europe by socialist or socially concerned governments
We looked at the pictures with admiration
Instead of the messy workingclass districts we knew in American cities with their crowded buildings built right up in a wall against the streets with their mixture of housing and stores and pushcarts and signs with their sidewalks crowded with pedestrians and horses there were not many cars in poor areas then we saw simple blocks of buildings in modern styles oriented to catch the sun with ample space around each block
Yet today these onceadmired building blocks for workers from Germany and knowing when or under what regime they were built most people would prefer those individual homes shown in the Nazi publicity pamphlet
And many architects would agree
Moshe Safdie in his book Form and Purpose shows pictures of Israeli apartment complexes on the hills around Jerusalem built under a social democratic government
And he contrasts them unfavorably with Arab housing built without benefit of modernism or government concern for the poor or housing laws that guarantee subsidized and modern dwelling units to the poor
In other words the product of architectural concern for the working classes does nt evoke much admiration today
What seemed in the s and early postWorld War II decades to be responsive to social needs and indeed was responsive to social needs as far as architects and planners and socially minded governments could discern them at the time now seems to us inhumane soulless bureaucratic
It is a very upsetting development if we are concerned that architects take more account of social considerations when socially minded now appears to us pretty poor stuff
Were we wrong then about what was good housing for the poor and are we right now And if our tastes have changed so radically is it possible that they will change again and that we were right then and are wrong now
Consider a concrete example of how our tastes and judgments about housing for the poor have changed since the thirties
There is an aerial photograph much reproduced in reformist books on housing and urbanism of one of our first housing projects set in the midst of a sea of slums and tenements in Brooklyn
We see from the air the endless grid of streets lined with unbroken housing
We can see in the middle of each block if we look closely something rather fuzzy the backyards behind the tenements of each block
In the middle of the photograph a dozen blocks have been cleared away obliterating tenements and streets and set on this white and empty site are lined up the street grid as if to remind us that the original street grid was set down by soulless marketminded surveyors
These new houses for the workers are sited scientifically to catch the sun or for some other good reason that caused their designers to ignore the original street grid
Around the buildings is an expanse of empty land which will be dedicated to playgrounds and greenery
I recall as a socialminded and socialist youth looking at this picture proud at what had been done worried about how long it would take to clear away the surrounding sea of slums
When that photograph was first published the tenements represented the terrible past the housing project the future
We all know what housing projects represent to us today
Those older buildings if they have survived are now often more desirable not only to poor people but to middleclass people too
What explains this upsetting reversal of taste Do we deal with simple designers idiosyncrasies a and brownstones of New York properly remodeled of course to the housing that was built as part of a great social experiment That social experiment incorporated to the extent this could be done in the practical world of bureaucrats and financial limitations the thinking of socially concerned architects and planners
Is it that we simply and irrationally love strong cornices stoops columns heavy lintels strongly marked sills the occasional decoration that graced even the workers housing of the early twentieth century
If that explains the reversal of taste it would be irresponsible for us to prefer the old
But it turns out that many of the people for whom the subsidized public housing with plenty of open space was built also prefer the old
Now we must avoid the mistake of explaining people s preferences for one kind of housing or another only because of differences in design
People with few choices do nt decide on the basis of design
If we were to ask them they might say the project delinquent families or that they ca nt live near their mothers or they would give some other reason that relates to the social composition of the project or the bureaucratic rules under which it operates
Or if they prefer the project and many do we might find out that it s because it is comparatively so cheap because of its subsidies and not because of its design and more spacious surroundings
Design is nt everything
But design does play a role not only in the distaste of presentday designers and architects and planners for the results of the socially concerned architects and planners of the past but in the preferences of the people with limited choices who reject or accept them today
And so we have our problem Why is it that the sophisticated intelligence of socially minded architects did nt produce satisfactory environments for those with the least choice Even worse Why is it as my example suggests that environments built by commercial builders trying simply to make a buck as environments in their appeal to ordinary people Now here is something one has to ponder
It is all too easy to understand why the environments created by anonymous architects on Greek islands in Italian hill towns in Moroccan cities are so much more attractive to architects and designers today than what either sophisticated modernists or postmodernists do
That problem is a familiar one and we have answers that are more or less satisfactory
The town grew organically over time in one traditional style with one major traditional building material it enclosed a life defined by a traditional culture
What resulted impresses all architects and designers of whatever persuasion
In years of leafing through architectural books and magazines I have never yet seen a picture of one of these Mediterranean urban environments that was used to illustrate a bad environment
Every architect or designer loves them
It is only reformers who are unsophisticated as designers generally native who want to sweep them away because of crowding or dirt or limited air the building blocks that have become the uniform residence of people all over the world
So we understand well enough why these environments have become so attractive to us
We know why or can guess why even the modern displaced Arab who does know about other ways of building who can use a variety of materials who has to build his housing fast rather than over centuries and who may want to accommodate cars seems to build a better environment according to Moshe Safdie than the Israeli government agencies with their advanced Westerntrained architects and designers modern standards uptodateness in all respects
For an architect to lose out to the Arab or any other traditional builder of the vernacular housing of a traditional culture in the way of producing good housing is not so devastating after all we are up against all that traditional wisdom developed over the ages
But to lose out to the commercial builder is another matter and one that can not make the commercial builder beats out the architectdesigner
The question is why and I suspect the answers will teach us more than we can learn from the Mediterranean village or the other wonderful works of the vernacular builder
Consider two further examples of this competition between the commercial builder with no higher ambition than to produce what will sell or rent and the sophisticated architectdesigner
The first comes from England and it is the case of the town of Sunderland a shipbuilding and coalmining town fallen on hard times for some decades in which old housing has been cleared away for new development in the decades since World War II
England we should recall stood in the first few decades after the war at the forefront of planning internationally and at the forefront of Europe in the provision of good housing for the working classes
It was a Mecca for anyone interested in good planning and in sensible replacement of housing stock
The case of Sunderland has been described in a fascinating book by Norman Dennis of course went first and there seems to have been little opposition to clearing it after all all those who lost their housing were guaranteed new wellsubsidized modern housing
By the worst of the slums had been cleared but central government money was still available for going further and planners selected the areas by their standards that should be leveled with the people rehoused in new modern flats
By this time the resistance was severe
Why Consider the houses that were coming down to be replaced by modern flats
They are typical of the row houses for workers of the dreary industrial towns of England
These cottages as they were called in Sunderland were built for the working class by unnamed builders one hundred years ago
Many were rented but most were by this time owned by their inhabitants
The houses sit directly on the sidewalk
There are no trees on the street
There is no front yard
We floor and if there s a second as some have two more windows
There is a tiny backyard with a brick outhouse
What could possess people to prefer these anonymous and styleless dwellings to new flats and ones heavily subsidized to boot But if one looks more closely one sees that one facade has been stuccoed another left in brick
One entry has a flat top another an arched one
Some windows have heavily marked lintels top and bottom
Others have the lintels stuccoed over
At the end of one block in a unit identical to the others is the Gardener s Arms a pub
We can understand some of the reasons why people preferred to stay and some of them have nothing to do with architects or designers
They had lived there a long time
They had their friends there
They had their local stores to shop in their churches and chapels
All this would be hard to replace in the new areas where the center of town with plenty of buses
In the new outlying areas to which they would have to move there were fewer buses running infrequently
And even though I imagine none of us would think much of Sunderland on a Saturday night a center is still a center for convenience for liveliness
Many of them owned their own cottages and could do with them what they liked and arrange them to their taste
They were no longer crowded
But after all this the striking thing is that housing built with ostensibly no attention to personal taste and desire thrown up to cover the most land and make the most money using the materials and technology of the s was considered superior by many of those living in them to the new flats designed by the best planning authorities using good architects
Imagine what the cooking bathing and toileting facilities of such cottages were
The wc s were typically out in the backyard and the cottages had no Greek isles or the Italian hill towns it was ordinary workingclass uninspired housing and yet the residents preferred it
Could they have been provided with something that gave them the advantages of the old houses they had and which eliminated the very striking disadvantages Very likely
But we have some evidence that a taste for a proper modern style on the part of the architects made a close replacement impossible
The local authorities were committed to flats
In discussing with the relevant officers the reasons for choosing flats as a form of development in Sunderland the interviewer was told that highrise blocks are essential to the skyline of the town
Seven blocks of storied flats were built at Gilley Law on the outskirts of the town as a result of an aesthetic choice
""
The mind boggles at the thought of sixteenstory apartment houses in Sunderland where the top density of the area to be cleared twostory houses was only sixtyeight rooms per acre
Most of the rehousing the residents still opposed that
So we can well understand why many of the people of Sunderland preferred to stay in their old houses and their old neighborhoods
They even argued their disadvantages were advantages
The fact that the main window was right on the pavement they said meant more privacy
Passersby do nt get the chance to look in they are past too quickly
""
We understand that everyone prefers a place of his own with his own front and backyard
We also understand that when we build at the high densities of large cities not everyone can have them
But consider a dense city such as Manhattan
We find that even the commercially built housing of New York City that would appear on the face of it much less desirable than the Sunderland cottages also had virtues that new housing could not provide
The plan for Manhattan has been denounced by every sophisticated planner
As Lewis Mumford and others argued the checkerboard plan and avenues coming at fixed intervals each block was the same size and each could be reduced to the same property modules for easy marketing no oddsized lots and modules could be cumulated for larger property sizes
And so the peculiar Manhattan block with its long and narrow street side its short side on a wide avenue broken into TOOLONG building lots
The plan required no sophistication no diagonal streets no adaptation to topography
And it turned out utilizing it for commercial building required no sophistication either
The brownstone town house was invented for the upper middle classes and put up by the thousands the tenement and other apartment houses were invented for the working classes and put up by the thousands
For grandeur a few lots were put together for the town houses of Fifth Avenue and later for huge apartment houses a halfblock or block in size on Park Avenue and on other avenues
No one has ever had a good word for this nondesign tearing it down
Then we discovered that the brownstone provided wonderful living quarters even when it was broken down to house a halfdozen or more families that the tenements once the severe overcrowding was overcome that is generally the single most serious problem in housing for the poor also provided good living space
For a child growing up in these tenements there was really no serious problem except crowding
The street side of the tenement provided life variety play spaces around stoops even play spaces in the streets before the traffic became heavy
Marbles could be rolled along the curbside I was always mystified at how kids could play marbles without a convenient curb along which to roll them
On the other side of the house were the quiet backyards
They even had trees
Despite the crowding in the tenements these backyards completely surrounded by buildings that by law could not occupy the entire building space and cut off on all sides from street and avenue were quiet
of the noise of Manhattan if that is people are not playing their radios
Two kinds of structure have replaced them insofar as they have been replaced for residential purposes rather than commercial and business purposes we have public housing projects built tall to reserve the largest amount of space for greenery and parking and to open up the apartments to more light and air and more crowded unsubsidized apartment houses built on a huge scale compared to the old brownstones and tenements on large plots
The former reflect public decisions partially unconstrained by market costs the latter represent market decisions under a variety of constraints that are more severe than those that limited the earlier buildings
Both I would argue have provided worse living quarters than were provided earlier
The story I have told is not one confined to New York City
Herbert Gans in his wellknown book The Urban Villagers describes the tenements of the West End of Boston the area adjacent to be replaced by tall modern apartment houses
The houses of the West End were quite similar to those in the tenement areas of New York except that the buildings were somewhat lower and smaller
If we look at the pictures in The Urban Villagers we find units not very different from Little Italy in New York or the West Village tenements
Again once the overcrowding of poverty was overcome the people living there found their condition perfectly satisfactory indeed more than satisfactory
They resisted fiercely being driven out of their homes for new development for others
Of course their satisfaction as is the satisfaction of the brownstone and tenement dwellers of New York was not provided only or perhaps not even primarily by the design of their houses
One must take into account that they had lived there a long time and had their shopping places and churches and friends and relatives nearby
They also paid low rents for their older quarters
But I would insist that there were aspects of satisfactions they had one or three neighbors on an entry rather than twenty or thirty they were closer to the ground in three four and fivestory buildings and could watch their children at play or call to them they had enclosed semiprivate open space not in this case for them individually of course but still space in the backyards that provided a different and quiet experience as well as public space which the towersinapark design of public housing as well as unsubsidized apartment towers could not provide
The point is not to praise the commercially minded builder who is of course concerned with cutting costs to the bone and getting the best return on his money
It is rather to force us to ponder the comparison between thoughtlessness and sophistication in design at the point where it should most favor the sophisticated to consider why private building for the incredibly poor workers of the past was superior to the public building of our more prosperous societies for more prosperous people satisfaction seem to have been ignored by the sophisticated
They were cavalier about the characteristics and satisfactions of old neighborhoods
They were all too ready to wipe away what existed and start with a clean slate many preferred to do this and objected to the costs of retaining some of the old and integrating it with the new
They were attached to forms whether the high tower or the flats that look like factories or machines for living
It has been it is my impression not architects but their critics as well as resisting homeowners tenants and residents of old areas who have limited mass clearance and have sparked as much rehabilitation as we have
It was not the architects who advocated rehabilitation though to my mind rehabilitation offers designers wonderful opportunities
Most significantly designers failed to explore just what it is people find attractive in areas and buildings for whose design characteristics not much if anything can be said
How often have we seen those pictures of endless Levittowns little houses lessons to avoid And how often have we contrasted them to their disadvantage with gleaming visions of great towers Let us put to one side for a moment the economic arguments that require density and let us recognize that very often the density and overall cost of singlefamily homes packed closely or lowlying apartments would compare favorably with twentystory apartment towers
I will not enter into the argument of comparative costs which is in any case complicated but we all know that studies have shown that the advantages are not always in one direction and that often an aesthetic choice to quote from the Sunderland investigation a choice by either public authorities designers or commercial builders dictates height
So let us go back to the contrast without worrying about the economics Levittown on one side and on the other striking apartment towers and they have recently been striking indeed serpentine on the outskirts of Paris inverted pyramids on the outskirts of Rome or spiky concentrations the architect or critic may have of the latter they are at least interesting
But let us look at the contrast ten or twenty years after they are completed
In Levittown the trees have grown various types of fences wall in back and front yards some buildings sprout additions on top some on the side with the children gone rooms are being remodeled from bedrooms to libraries and so on and so on
The apartment towers one suspects show no such opportunities for change
How could they since their residents have so little power over their environment The trees will grow and the landscaping perhaps improve if there s money for it but there wo nt be much if people do nt see it as theirs
Finally am I saying the architect ca nt beat Levittown and that there is nothing to his skill his training his taste his occasional genius that makes up for the ordinary crass effort to provide what people want can afford No I would not say that but rather that the architect has not tried hard enough to find out what people liked and like whether in old slums or new developments and to see what his skills could do to satisfy build on and improve upon that even though there are some remarkable and admirable exceptions
I admit it is more fun to explore Greek islands and Italian hill towns than American slums and suburbs but there is as much to learn in the latter as the former
Wherever social scientists examine these things they find a taste that architects on the whole do not find it interesting to satisfy a taste for the lowrise the small scale the unit that gives some privacy some control some access to the ground a small piece of land wholly under one s control
I am not of course describing a universal taste
But for people raising children and indeed many others it is a near universal taste any reason to think that it is necessary or desirable that people be educated against that taste and develop a new taste for a larger or gargantuan scale
On occasion conditions seem to make what most people want impossible particularly in the very largest cities
New tastes are developed and people find it is possible to adapt to tall blocks and greater density many have and many more will have to
Even when we adapt to such necessities there are things to learn from how people live and use space that we have not yet learned
Nor am I convinced that the exigencies of finances or the requirements of ordinances and laws will make it impossible to provide environments people find more satisfactory
The sociologist considering what people like and what they find satisfactory is likely to appear a real spoilsport to architects and designers a rather glum soul who first tells us that they prefer their old buildings any old buildings to new ones and secondly that even when you drive them out nice in something new it tends to be a homey fussy dowdy singlefamily house they prefer rather than sparkling towers of interesting shapes or modernist structures of glass and aluminum
After all architects and designers want to soar both to build and design great things new and not yet imagined things and are we to confine them by what the ordinary man prefers and insists upon
Well to begin with in a modern consumer society the ordinary man will eventually get what he wants unless it is being provided by central government heavily subsidized and being given to him whether he wants it or not as in the case of council housing blocks in England or public housing in the United States
In both countries we are now dynamiting the tall blocks that were once the admired model for family housing only twenty or thirty years ago
But second the architect and designer can still soar because there are many more structures in the world than those required
After all historically the architect and designer has only soared when he built for the rich for the state for the church
He still can if these clients will let him and in addition he now has a very substantial client who wants things big and striking the corporation rearing its towers
Not that he should or could ignore what people want in working environments or convening environments or even worshipping environments but everyone accepts the symbolic role of such structures and one can break out without the need for an economical accommodation of needs
And of course there are other ways of soaring of building big and once again one thinks of the Greek isles and Italian hill towns and Moroccan cities in which an organized approach to building added to bit by bit over time has created environments to which people cling and which delight the eyes and souls of architects and designers
But if we are to expect the accumulation of smallscale environments virtue of the small scale to cumulate into grand structures and environments we probably need more changes in our society than I can envisage
Christopher Alexander and his associates have made a heroic effort to establish such a way of building for our day in which more or less anonymous action produces large and substantial effects and it is an effort that must arouse our sympathy and awe even if we recognize its problems
Perhaps there is still a way for the architect without becoming as so many modern formmakers have insisted the dictator of an environment to provide a process a set of tools a mechanism whereby individual action can cumulate to great harmonious wholes
But the only way of doing that in the absence of dictators is through a steady and dedicated concern with how people live what they want what they find desirable and attractive and what they find troublesome and inconvenient
This has to be done before one builds while one builds after one builds nt it delightful to put everyone into a great triangle or obelisk or a sphere has to collapse under this investigation so be it
We can always put it in drawings
Little by little is I suspect in the modern world the answer not only in building but in public policy where many great schemes have come crashing down
Pondering his study of Sunderland which he began with the easy optimistic belief that welltrained planners and designers know best Norman Dennis was driven to another conclusion
He writes
As Edmund Burke said in another connection the high level of satisfaction in areas like the ones scheduled to be torn down is the result of a choice not of one day or one set of people
""

""
It is made by the peculiar circumstances occasion tempers dispositions and moral civil and social habitudes of the people which disclose themselves only in a long period of time
And again and finally of wisdom when we work only on inanimate matter surely they become part of duty too when the subject of our demolition and construction is not bricks and timber but sentient being
The true lawgiver and I would add the architect and designer too ought to love and respect his kind and to fear himself

Section Life and Letters
In the house of literature there are many anterooms
Let s suppose for instance that we find ourselves in the most public of this stately house s rooms the parlor
While the great writer is busy working upstairs here milling around are the various people who play subsidiary roles in that writer s life in one corner stand family members and close friends in another deep in conference are editors publishers agents also present are journalists photographers proteges miscellaneous admirers and hangerson and perhaps taking notes in an alcove the writer s official biographer
After sampling a canape or two you might gradually become aware of a particular undercurrent of noise drifting through the room an ostensibly polite steady background hum
This is the hum of rumor and speculation about all the extracurricular details crowding behind the solitary work of literary production
It is a hum generated by intense interest most often is the hum in short of the politics of literary celebrity
Now to complicate this parlor game imagine that we are in this crowded room at a particular time the time say right after the great writer has died
The corpse and corpus lie in state elsewhere finished untouchable this is a room for the living and the changeable for murmurs of genuine sorrow and transparent sycophancy for the complex messy business of summing up a life and putting it in perspective
By the window near the table on which rests the sherry stands the person who presides over this scene
She is the person who having seen to the decoration and cleaning of this parlor and the rest of the great writer s house having provided his inspiration raised his children typed his manuscripts offered critical advice protected him from excess publicity and nursed him through his last illness is now in a position to be the subject of this essay the writer s widow Is nt this one of those subjects that prurient biographers are always chewing over insisting that it sheds light whether bright or dim on the author s work Perhaps
But one reason to take a careful look at writers widows is that they themselves are a juicy literary subject
The very word widow is full of drama one thinks immediately of black lace mantillas of legacies and lawyers of hoarded letters and battles over access to them
One thinks of the small but compelling literary subgenre devoted to tales about the wish to control a dead writer s reputation among them The Aspern Papers and Pale Fire
Such a subject speaks to the invariably interesting question of the durability of literary celebrity of the ways a writer s work manages or fails to remain alive to the reading public after his death
Sometimes though not as often as one might think this has something to do with the success of the author s widow in When I speak of the writer s widow as a general phenomenon one might naturally assume that I am thinking only of those dead authors who are male
There have of course been notable literary widowers as well Leonard Woolf and John Middleton Murry the husband of Katherine Mansfield come quickly to mind
There are all kinds of widows and widowers whom I will have for reasons of length to overlook for example widows who have themselves had their own careers in the literary world such as Mary Shelley or Diana Trilling or homosexual partners who have outlived their literary spouses or widows of men involved in arts other than literature such as Gertrud Schoenberg or Olgivanna the widow of Frank Lloyd Wright
I have also overlooked women who performed many of the duties of wife and widow when they were in fact not married to the writer in question one wellknown example is William Wordworth s sister Dorothy whose total dedication to her brother s personal and professional the poet s wife
Literary biography has tended to provide a harsh view of the writer s widow
Often perceived as a suspicious venal shrew arguing endlessly over copyrights and royalties she is traditionally maligned as a stumbling block between the author s oeuvre and his adoring readers
And when she is not maligned the writer s widow is satirized made to look ridiculous for her willingness to be attached Nora Barnaclelike to the underside of an author s career and then when that career is over to submit herself to the unrewarded task of preserving that career in the public imagination
Probably the most famous example of this kind of satire was Somerset Maugham s Cakes and Ale published in 
Although Maugham at first vigorously denied it the book was widely recognized upon publication as a vicious portrait of Thomas Hardy who had died two years earlier and Florence Dugdale Hardy his second wife
In the Saturday Review of Literature J that if Maugham did not intend his readers to be reminded of Hardy then he acted with strange stupidity and a less stupid man than Somerset Maugham never set pen to paper
Priestley went on nearly licking his chops at the prospect to anticipate a cheerful row
And he was not disappointed
Reviews of Cakes and Ale carried titles that expressed the general outrage Trampling on Thomas Hardy s Grave Hitting Below the Shroud Grave Profaned by Literary Ghoul
Maugham of course delighted in the notoriety and watched the sales figures for his book mount as the publicity increased
Maugham s chief satirical objective in Cakes and Ale was to expose the absurdly wide margin between the public s fantasy of an exalted writer s life and the vulgar even pathetic details of that writer s existence
The great author in Cakes and Ale Edward Driffield had been in his youth a rather seaside town of Blackstable actually in Hardy s case Dorchester whose first wife a former barmaid had left him for a bounder
Driffield makes it grandly as a novelist enters fashionable society and marries his young secretary Amy who cares for him until his death at the age of eightyfour
The book s narrator a younger writer named Ashenden who had known Driffield and his first wife at Blackstable when he was a boy describes Driffield near the end of his life
He looked an old old man hanging on to mortality by a thread he wore very white false teeth and they made his smile seem forced and stiff
I had never seen him but bearded and his lips were thin and pallid
He was dressed in a new wellcut suit of blue serge and his low collar two or three sizes too large for him showed a wrinkled scraggy neck
He wore a neat black tie with a pearl in mufti on his summer holiday in Switzerland
It was as clear to readers in as it is today that all these details add up to a fullscale attack on the wifely ambitions of the second Mrs Driffield
Maugham provides a quite horrible picture of helpless old age in which a weakened man is dressed up like a mannequin to impersonate his philistine wife s notion of a Famous Author
That Driffield in his former years had been a slovenly bohemian adds of course to the cruel comedy of his absurd elderly nattiness
Ashenden speaking doubtless for Maugham hardly bothers to sheathe his claws in describing the Driffields house Ferne Court furnished in the acme of good taste with a drawingroom decorated so exactly as you felt a drawingroom in a country house of modest size should be furnished that it was slightly disconcerting
Here Driffield entertains high society in the company of his neatlyturnedout wife so competent and discreetly managing
""
""
""
I wondered wondered if all this amused him or if the amiable civility of his manner masked a hideous boredom
""
It is after the author dies however that Maugham s Amy Driffield comes under heavy vituperative attack
Rather than being condemned for neglecting her husband s reputation Amy Driffield is mocked far more cruelly for her diligence in protecting it
She plays the role of widow as gamely and as unimaginatively as she had played at being Driffield s wife
When a campaign is launched to bury the author in Westminster Abbey Ashenden notes Mrs Driffield sent a dignified letter to the Press in which she expressed her confidence that she was carrying out the dearest wishes of her dead husband in having him buried among the simple people he knew and loved so well
This is Maugham s opportunity to portray Amy Driffield as a perfectly correct and perfectly insufferable snob for Ashenden continues Unless the notabilities of Blackstable have very much changed since my day I do not believe they vastly I afterward learnt they had never been able to abide the second Mrs Driffield
""
Toward the end of the novel Ashenden goes to Ferne Court to visit with Amy Driffield
In his description of her life here as the high priestess of the dead author s cult Maugham s cruelty reaches its apex
The scene was perfectly set notes Ashenden
I do not know why the room seemed so strangely dead it had already the mustiness of a museum
Ferne Court s drawingroom shouts decorum at Ashenden in much the same way as its study had urged preservation
It suited the widow of a distinguished man of letters almost more than it had suited the wife
Those chintzes those bowls of potpourri those Dresden China figures there was about them a faint air of regret they seemed to reflect pensively upon a past of distinction
The novel ends with Ashenden going to visit Driffield s seventyyearold first wife Rosie living in of all places Yonkers New York
At this point Maugham s satirical tone ends and a strange perverse sort of sentimentality takes over as Ashenden reflects on the lusty life of Rosie with whom he had himself long ago been in love
As a final behindtheback slur on Amy Driffield s character Maugham portrays Rosie as much more authentic vibrant and inspirational to Driffield than was his boringly sedulous second wife
When Cakes and Ale first appeared Thomas Hardy had been dead for two years he was eightyseven when he died Florence Hardy his widow was fiftyone
Maugham claimed to have met Hardy on only one occasion at the end of Hardy s life but there was no question in Florence s mind that Maugham was parodying her life as Hardy s widow
It must have pained her in to note the novel s details about her life that were false but no doubt it was much more painful
For my discussion of Florence Hardy I have relied on Michael Millgate s biography Thomas Hardy Oxford University Press Mr Millgate s introduction to The Life and Work of Thomas Hardy by Thomas Hardy University of Georgia Press and The Second Mrs Hardy by Robert Gittings and Jo Manton Heinemann 
""
To appreciate the difficulties of Florence s widowhood it is necessary briefly to rehearse the story of her marriage to Hardy
Florence Dugdale had met Hardy in the Reading Room of the British Museum while he was still married unhappily to his first wife Emma
What very strange marriages literary men seem to make wrote Fanny Stevenson after a visit to Emma and Thomas Hardy this from a woman whose own marriage to Robert Louis Stevenson was itself far from conventional
A former schoolteacher with a humble family background who was now dabbling in journalism Florence agreed to act as Hardy s secretary and became Gate located just southeast of Dorchester
Hardy fell in love with Florence and wooed her for seven years behind Emma s back
When Emma died in Florence lost no time in moving secretly into Max Gate
She and Hardy were soon married which created a minor scandal
All was not bliss
Hardy began perversely to develop an enormous crush on the dead Emma or more exactly on his idealized memory of her
He began to write a series of his loveliest poems dedicated to happy reveries about their early marriage and to his huge sense of loss
So it happened as Robert Gittings and Jo Manton have observed in The Second Mrs Hardy that Florence once Hardy s coveted unavailable love replaced Emma the alltooavailable wife while poor dead Emma with Hardy married to Florence now became the unavailable love object
Somewhat less than perfect though Florence must have found this situation it appears that she went along with it without much fuss more to contend with than the ghost of her husband s first wife
There were conflicts galore beginning no later than the funeral
Hardy s friend Sydney Cockerell whom Hardy had named with Florence as joint trustee of his estate had arranged for a ceremonious burial at Westminster Abbey just as Maugham had written in Cakes and Ale
Yet Hardy had requested that he be buried with his family in Stinsford churchyard near the house where he was born
To Florence s acute dismay a rather gruesome compromise was reached
Hardy s remains were duly cremated and interred in Poets Corner at Westminster Abbey but not before his heart was removed from his body and transferred to Stinsford where it was buried during a second funeral service
Feeling understandably that she had been pushed by Cockerell and his coconspirator the playwright James Barrie into making these unsavory if not to say grisly burial arrangements Florence hastened to establish her dominion over Hardy s literary remains
She patiently typed and retyped the manuscript of Hardy s autobiography while he was alive she was not easily going to give up her right to control the publication of her husband s works now that he was dead
That same year she rushed into publication a first volume of the autobiography changing Hardy s firstperson narrative into the third person and claiming that the book was actually her own biography of her husband
But the narrative was largely Hardy s as he had meant it to be for he had intended this book to stand as the authoritative record of his life
Florence s claim to authorship was not entirely a fiction however for she deleted nearly all of her husband s affectionate references to his first wife Emma and made some lengthy additions of her own additions that as Michael Millgate has said either had been or would have been rejected by Hardy
From the text and from that of the second volume published in and her help with Hardy s writing as well as his wishfully fabricated stories about Emma s friendship with Florence in the years before Emma s death
With equal thoroughness Florence burned every trace of Emma s former presence at Max Gate destroying two locked boudoirs full of her clothes her papers even allegedly her old corsets
So much for Emma
Now Florence tried to rid herself of her cotrustee Cockerell whose ideas for erecting grand public statues of his friend deeply offended her sensibilities
The two executors quarreled bitterly Cockerell calling Florence an inferior woman with a suburban mind shades of Amy Driffield and Florence trying unsuccessfully to give up her trusteeship
Each began to act behind the other s back
In Florence privately printed a forgotten story of her husband s without consulting Cockerell while in he took part in reconsecrating a church as a memorial to Hardy an occasion to which Florence was not invited
Meanwhile the reviews that began praising the author s wife for her discretion
Florence set herself up at Max Gate as the overseer of Hardy s one true memorial the museum that Maugham described with such malicious accuracy
But this was not the end of Florence Hardy s story as it was Amy Driffield s
Without knowing it Florence had been married to a man of substantial wealth
When Hardy died his estate was valued at more than pounds and his royalties and copyrights were worth a fortune
Accustomed to running her household on a shoestring Florence now found herself in a position to act on some of her ambitions to own a car to travel and to have a flat of her own in London
She chose a flat in the same house in which Hardy had once worked a block from the residence of Sir James Barrie
When her longestablished acquaintance with this friend and admirer of her husband s was rekindled in the city Florence poignantly mistook Barrie s neighborly affection all in his early seventies the age Hardy had been when they married and he seemed to need looking after for the strange childlike author of Peter Pan was frequently in poor health
Florence had been Hardy s nurse for years before he died it was natural for her to want to assume the same duties for Barrie
There was no way Florence was ever going to become Lady Barrie no matter how many fond hopes she may have cherished
For Barrie had not to put too fine a point on it a thing for the wives and widows of famous men he liked to flatter them even to give them large gifts of money but he never intended or allowed his excessive attentions to flower into intimacy
When this became painfully clear to Florence she packed up her things and went back to Max Gate
She was forced to conclude that in the eyes of London literary society in general and in the mind of Sir James in her great dead husband and someone regarded as wholly uninteresting in her own right
Florence spent the last years of her life entertaining American academic pilgrims at Max Gate supporting a local hospital and serving as Hardy once had as a Borough Magistrate in Dorchester where she worked to improve child welfare and lowcost housing
When she died in at the age of fiftyeight her ashes were buried next to Hardy s grave in Stinsford churchyard
As Hardy s widow Florence managed to accomplish little in the shaping of his reputation or the publication of his works
That he remains one of the brightest lights of English literature is true largely because the works poetry and novels that were so famous in his lifetime continue to speak to readers sixty years after his death
In most biographies of Hardy Florence is mentioned as only a peripheral figure
Except as the author of his biography she rarely appears in indexes of scholarly studies
Of course she survives Ale in which Maugham gleefully recorded her unimaginative tastes her grim decorum her curatorial zeal
Whether she behaved the way she did because of the demands of her milieu despite the rather daring circumstances in which she and Hardy were married she otherwise operated within the complacent conventions of Edwardian middleclass English life or whether she was incapable of being anything other than the stubbornly loyal protective undemanding soul she was one can not say
Patience Hardy had written in Tess of the DUrbervilles is that blending of moral courage with physical timidity
But if ever a widow has been penalized for behaving exactly as convention dictated that widow was Florence Dugdale Hardy
Being Hardy s widow was at best a mixed blessing at worst a thankless task
Hardy could have been speaking for his wife when he wrote in his bitter poem titled Hap of the purblind Doomsters Casualty and Time who can just as arbitrarily sprinkle While Cakes and Ale has been considered an eminently capable if cruel representation of Florence Hardy it would take a novelist far more powerful than Maugham to capture the drama of Countess Tolstoy s predicament after her husband had died
In its largeness not even Cecil B deMille could have captured it
For the Tolstoys did everything on a scale as spectacular as the history of their huge crumbling country and dying was no exception
It is hard to imagine today when it is so easy to be famous merely for being well known the exact nature and scope of the Tolstoys fame at the time of Leo Tolstoy s death at Astapovo in 
Around that bleak wintry train station were gathered swarms of photographers journalists chief disciples of the Tolstoyan philosophy and members of the great man s family who had chartered a special train to take them there
Conspicuously present was that symbol of modern celebrity the steadily whirring Pathe movie camera
In the middle reaching its end
Sonya Tolstoy was not allowed to see her husband until he was nearly dead for it was thought that the sight of her would hasten his death
The chief reason the eightytwoyearold Tolstoy had taken flight from his estate at Yasnaya Polyana was that he could no longer endure the increasingly titanic battles with his wife of fortyeight years
She had borne him thirteen children patiently copied his manuscripts as he wrote them she copied War and Peace seven separate times and he followed her advice to publish the novel himself in six volumes worked side by side with him in the fields during a countrywide famine managed his estate and farmlands no small task especially after Tolstoy decided to renounce all his interest in property and faithfully if uncomprehendingly stood by him as he underwent the lengthy philosophical conversion that fostered a worldwide cult
By the time the aged ailing Tolstoy made his escape Sonya reminded him of every materialistic tie to the world from which she would not subscribe to some of his most cherished beliefs would not become a vegetarian or resolve as he did to live the simple life of a peasant
Meanwhile Sonya not without cause was looking for some financial recompense for her longterm endurance
She fought and lost an epic battle over the copyrights to Tolstoy s works over the rights to publish his diaries and over his will of which many drafts were made and which put his literary estate in the hands of his chief disciple the relentless and secretive Vladimir Chertkov and Tolstoy s daughter Sasha who was Chertkov s main collaborationist
Sonya was not about to let all of this happen without some fireworks she screamed she spied she cajoled she threatened she even made at least one suicide attempt
Tolstoy simply wanted to be left in peace
One of his most famous Tolstoyan principles was the renunciation of all property and he could not understand why his copyrights and was not as detached from the battle as he pretended
His wife was the one person who could torture him as he was torturing her
Finally after many agitated years when both husband and wife were halfmad with anger he made his desperate illfated escape to Astapovo
At last a few hours before Tolstoy died it was decided that Sonya should be permitted to see him
For a description of the scene that reads like a passage from a novel by Tolstoy himself it would be difficult to match that of Henri Troyat from his wellknown biography
She stopped short swaying in the doorway of the room not daring to go near her husband in front of all these people who hated her
From the doorway she looked at the skeletal little old man with the cavernous cheeks and white beard who was all the love of her life
At last she made up her mind and walked straight up to the bed kissed her Lyovochka on the forgive me
But he did not hear
The funeral train that carried the body of Tolstoy back to Yasnaya Polyana for burial required two cars one for Tolstoy and one for all the journalists photographers and newsreel cameramen who were recording the event
Four thousand people met the train at the Tolstoy estate
The open coffin was put on a table in the house so that mourners could file through to pay their respects
Meanwhile there were demonstrations throughout Russia the incendiary spirit already in the air was fueled by memorials for the writer who had believed so passionately in revolution
As A N Wilson points out in his recent biography Tolstoy seven years after Tolstoy s death when Lenin s Revolution broke out such was the association in the world s mind of Tolstoy with revolution that the Western press erroneously described the events of as a Tolstoyan Revolution
This was fame on a nearly unprecedented scale
If there was no shortage of public grief from a bad conscience for one thing
There are many who believe Sonya Tolstoy was seriously mentally ill by this point whether or not this is true it is nonetheless clear that her remorse and her guilt were real she believed that she was responsible for her husband s death
A month after the funeral she wrote in her diary Have put away husband s things to protect them from moths
""
""
""
It is a torture to go on living
She told her daughter Tatyana that she thought incessantly about Tolstoy and added I treated him badly and it s a torment to me
""
""
""
Surprisingly Sonya now went so far as to become a vegetarian as her husband had wished
By all accounts she behaved in a mild kind distracted way to everyone at the estate as if her former obstinacy had been crushed by grief
But as Tatyana Tolstoy the writer s daughter has written of what people would say and write about her when she was gone she feared for her reputation
As a result she never let slip the slightest opportunity of justifying her words and actions
There was no weapon she would not use in her campaign of selfdefense she was warding off in advance the attacks she knew one day would be made upon her
And she knew by whom
Whom meant Chertkov and his band of Tolstoyans Sonya s sworn enemies
He along with Sasha Tolstoy was now in control of Tolstoy s literary rights and published works
Sonya still retained legal possession of Yasnaya Polyana but Tolstoy had wished Sasha to buy it from her mother and then turn it over to the peasants
In Sasha bought the estate for four hundred thousand rubles giving twothirds of it to the peasants
Sonya kept of the original acres
The year before her house in Moscow was sold to the government with the request that it be made into had established was no longer allowed to produce Tolstoy s works
To make matters worse Tolstoy s other children blamed their mother for allowing Tolstoy to leave everything to Sasha
Most likely Tolstoy had not really intended to torture his wife by excluding her from his will but only wished her to convert to the Tolstoyan faith and renounce her desire to own property
Yet the practicalminded Sonya regarded this understandably as monstrous that her husband expected her not only to raise his children handle his huge estate and social world but also to be a perfect Tolstoyan in word and deed is truly amazing
All the same she felt guilty for her failure and it seems that everybody around her blamed her for her husband s desperate end
The Countess stopped writing in her diary shortly after Tolstoy died claiming that what was of importance was the past and anything concerning the memory of Tolstoy
She insisted that the money from the estate sale to Sasha be divided among her a pension bestowed by the tsar
Continuing to preside quietly over the main house at Yasnaya Polyana she kept everything as it had been while Tolstoy was alive
Outside the peasants running amok with their new wealth began to chop down the large forest around the estate while the impervious Sonya saw that everything was in order at the house
Her relative calm after so many years of Sturm und Drang appeared to her children to be a sign of dementia
It seemed no one was ever again going to remember her as anything other than a madwoman whether a raving or a subdued one
When World War I began Sonya ignored the brief wave of patriotism that swept the country as Russia entered the war
She lived almost completely in her memories
She had nearly lost her eyesight by the time the Bolsheviks took power and helpless she feared an ambush
But the peasants stood guard and protected her through that long summer of 
During the widespread of it was still served at Yasnaya Polyana by Sonya s whitegloved valet at the end of the year however the government took over the estate to transform it into a farming collective
Ironically when strangers moved into the house to organize the collective Sonya s treacherous daughter Sasha returned to become the collective s chairman
Sonya was now in the humiliating position of having to ask for everything she needed from the daughter who had already agreed to divest her of her proper inheritance
Sonya did not surely she could not live through these precarious times for much longer
She died of pneumonia as Tolstoy had in at the age of seventyfive having lived through four tsars two famines several wars and revolution
Food was scarce around the time of her funeral so her many fine old clothes were immediately sold to buy flour for the farming collective
Eight years after Tolstoy had died Sonya was said to have remarked I lived really learned what kind of man he was
This is an astonishing statement but it is not hard to believe if one knows anything at all about Tolstoy s conflictridden quixotic messianic nature
Yet there can be little doubt that she loved him greatly loved him even through her hatred of him through all her doubts about his philosophizing and through his ghastly treatment of her
It took an extremely competent highly intelligent hugely energetic woman to meet the demands of marriage to Count Leo Tolstoy and Sonya Tolstoy was all of these things
Where Florence Hardy rose from undistinguished origins and tried hard to fit into the role of Mrs Hardy Sonya educated and aristocratic knew from the beginning how to be Countess Tolstoy
She was an endlessly capable utterly manipulative woman much more complicated than the simple Florence and her effusive sufferings with all imperial Russia crashing down in the background seem much more grandiose
Yet there were aspects of being Countess Tolstoy that As much as she feared her reputation being slandered after she was dead she loved the glamour of knowing she had been the wife of a genius of being unprecedentedly famous
She was cut out to play her role and she played it with great flair
In a sense Sonya Tolstoy was widowed twice for the ingenious writer with whom she had fallen in love had died figuratively around when Tolstoy abandoned the art of fiction for more lofty philosophical and religious pursuits
The first Tolstoy the artist had been far more tolerant than the second and the demands he made of his wife copying his manuscripts and advising him about their publication she had been only too happy to meet for she understood and revered his genius as a novelist
She was proud of her indispensability to Tolstoy at that time when there were not yet any disciples snooping around stealing her Lyovochka s love and attention there had been only Tolstoy his work his wife be no more marvelous novels only rambling philosophical tracts that were all but incomprehensible to Sonya there would be the inscrutable Chertkov taking over the role of chief helpmate to the the Master and there would be the endless terrible battles between husband and wife who each longed for the predicament to end but who could not until the end tear away from each other
She will remain a millstone around my neck and round the children s till I die Tolstoy wrote in his diary in 
""
If Sonya s power over her husband s literary life expired when Tolstoy renounced literature and resolved to become a saint her power over him in the second phase of his career though threatened was alive in a complex way and shaped by their long years together it was a power that existed beyond mere copyrights and wills which bound them together through the mutual torture session that became ultimately their marriage
Tolstoy had written in War and Peace as pure and complete joy
The Tolstoy marriage was a mixture of luxurious even epic portions of sorrow and joy
When Tolstoy died both the exhilaration of battle and the torment of love were dead to Sonya Tolstoy
One aspect that all literary widows seem to share is an element to a greater or lesser degree of theatricality or roleplaying as though in rising to meet the occasion of widowhood they found it necessary to enhance their personality
While Sonya Tolstoy s role as countess amounted to a star turn in nearly every other widow of a famous writer one can detect similar dramatic instincts
In the year after Edmund Wilson died according to his daughter Rosalind Wilson s widow Elena was described by friends as dashing about being very much Madame lExecutrix and having a happy social time

Nora Joyce the forthright Galway woman who had left Ireland at the age of twenty without looking back to live in exile with James Joyce rather enjoyed after his death in 
She had always been fond of publicity though she was never quite sure what all the fuss over Joyce was about yet as her biographer Brenda Maddox writes As she came to play the part of the Widow Joyce Nora began at last to believe in her husband s genius
If she was nt exactly merry Nora was pleased to give her opinions to all the Joyce worshippers who came to her eager for revelations
To a bibliographer she spoke in the voice that had long proved to be a crowdpleaser the endearingly unsentimental voice of Molly Bloom It is just as well my husband did nt have a literary wife
There had to be somebody to do the cooking and wash the dishes
To Ignazio Silone s wife who asked Nora s opinion of Andr Gide she replied Sure when you ve been married to the greatest writer in the world you do nt remember all the little fellows
And on the predicament of the author s widow They tell me my husband was one of the immortals
I d much rather be receiving some royalties from his books than be the widow of an immortal
""
One literary widow comes to mind whose roleplaying was not a theatrical pose but a matter of survival to whom profits from royalties and copyrights were for decades completely irrelevant since anyone could be arrested merely for distributing and certainly for publishing her husband s work
As late as in Russia there was not yet available a proper edition of her husband s works
Nadezhda Mandelstam widow of the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam took it upon herself to keep his name alive to become a human library of his work through a lifetime of indescribable repression and abuse
It would not be extravagant to claim that she is the most heroic literary widow in modern history
Anybody who has read Mrs Mandelstam s twovolume memoir Hope Against Hope and Hope its excruciating detail
Osip Mandelstam who along with Pasternak is regarded as the greatest twentiethcentury Russian poet could not bear to watch the stunning repression of artistic and personal freedom that terrorized the country after Stalin took control of the Soviet Union at the end of the s
Through his poetry Mandelstam openly challenged the regime by asking if certainly not for death then plainly for exile in the poem denouncing Stalin that led to his arrest he wrote Rather stuff me like a cap in the sleeve Of the Siberian steppes warm furcoat
He was arrested on May 
He died at the end of the year in a transit camp near Vladivostok
The exact date and circumstances of his death are still uncertain
After hints of her husband s death reached Nadezhda Mandelstam she lived as a fugitive always one step ahead of arrest
During World War II she managed to get to Tashkent where she somehow earned a university degree and was certified as live was her determination to preserve the memory of Mandelstam and his poetry in fact for her poetry and Mandelstam came to mean the same thing and when he was condemned to death so in her view was the fate of poetry condemned
Many of his poems she did not venture even to write down for fear of further persecution
Instead she learned them by heart
Mandelstam himself had made her memorize his autobiographical Fourth Prose as he dictated it to her no doubt with a premonition of his own fate
In the s and early s Mrs Mandelstam s twovolume memoir circulated in Russia in samizdat the underground method of distributing unpublished work in typescript and was published abroad in translation
She gave away all the royalties she received to her friends proud that after decades of homelessness fear and poverty she was finally in a position to offer assistance to others
At this time she was at last permitted to live in Moscow where she and had the luxury at last of openly playing the role of the great poet s widow
Often in the tiny kitchen of her apartment there was a crowd of people waiting to see her standing patiently as if in line for bread in a bakery
During the thirty years between the time Osip Mandelstam died and the time of Mrs Mandelstam s bitterly triumphant return to Moscow she witnessed events that one would think were beyond the powers of language to relate
Even so perhaps the most shocking aspect of her memoirs is her insistence that her story is totally unremarkable
If the police did not find me she writes in Hope Abandoned it was because I was like a needle in a haystack an infinitely small particle one of tens of millions of wives of men sent to the camps or killed in the prisons
Some women she claims had even less than the scant information she was able to obtain about the details of their Denisovich was a resort compared with the camps others described to her
Thinking about Mandelstam existing in such a camp was an agony to her
Something like relief came to her when she knew his sufferings were over
When I heard that M had died she wrote I stopped having my nightmares about him
""
Thank God that people are mortal Nadezhda Mandelstam wrote in Hope Against Hope
The only reason one could have to go on living was to remember it all and later tell the story
And in Hope Abandoned she goes on The reader is the final arbiter and it is for him that I kept Mandelstam s poetry and it is to him that I have handed it over
""
""
""
If the verse I have preserved is of some use to people then my life has not been wasted
""
Nadezhda Mandelstam died on December 
Far from having wasted her life of preservation
In many senses she nearly became her husband she adopted what has often been called his inner freedom his defiance and his determination and more prosaically as I am not the first to point out she adopted his style and language in her books
I think there is no greater miracle than time and the phenomenon derived from it memory she once wrote
As we know only too well history is constantly being falsified right in front of our eyes
What greater devotion could a widow display toward her husband than performing this miracle of memory for so many years and at such enormous risk Where I have been concerned up to this point with the degree to which authors widows have managed to control their husbands reputations here is a case in which a widow through sheer heroism was her husband s reputation no less and is the sole reason we are privileged to know and appreciate a conclusion to be drawn a common thread to be tied around the stories of these very different women with their vastly different histories who seem to share only the fact that they each lived with a husband who was also a literary genius They all wanted sovereignty over their husbands work though only one Nadezhda Mandelstam obtained it at a risk that might easily have cost her her life
Other than that fact the only thing these widows have in common is the malignant way in which their predicament seems habitually to be satirized in the public imagination
Florence Hardy s suburban mind Sonya Tolstoy s opera buffa doorslamming at Yasnaya Polyana even as some have characterized her at the end of her life Nadezhda Mandelstam s selfparody of a terminally irascible old crone despite all their efforts these are the ways authors widows are most often destined it appears to be portrayed
Yet as I started to read more about the lives of
For who would not after selfless years of coddling and caring for a difficult man long for a bit of power over his estate for a bit of public recognition of her own Who would not resent being judged as inconsequential as soon as the primary reason for her celebrity had been taken away from her And who could not resist the pleasure of serving as high priestess to worshippers wishing to pay their respects These caretakers of the house of literature while they created no art of their own in many thankless ways encouraged its production and protected it as they thought best
Whether their compensations were worth the price is a question I or perhaps anyone else ca nt presume to answer

Section Life and Letters A Memoir
It is the end of the day and the end of the summer
We sit a family gathered on the screenedin porch looking out over the lake
An afternoon storm has just passed and as the evening sky clears in the west the sinking sun catches the clouds still lowering overhead and suddenly the air about us is bright with gold a fair shimmering that glows on the lake and the yellowing birches and even touches our faces with a radiance not our own
We are stricken with the sudden glory our voices rise and fall in quiet flutterings of delight like dozing birds roused in our evening tree
Wonder exhausts our words and we fall into silence
A moment to remember I tell myself as long as I live
Tomorrow some of the family will leave and in a few days my wife and I will close the cabin for the winter
But for now my infant grandson sits perfect and undiscriminating curiosity that is the privilege of an innocence so lately rocked in fetal waters
His face glows in the golden light
I no innocent return his regard with an interest less pure as I seek in his placid features some resemblance to my own
I am his mother s father but in him I see mainly signs of his father s family my daughter s eyes perhaps which while not my own seem reminiscent of others in my family
It is an old delusion that passes quickly
What comfort for my decline in some blurred impress of myself on my posterity Indeed through the intervening embraces of passion the liquid exchanges of love what dilution of my DNA could still work its way in his veins write my message in his tender flesh What he finds in my face I can not guess
The sun settles lower and I am in shadow
We have been looking at a book together while the family murmurs and soft cheek have been nestled against my chest as I point to the bright pictures and prompt his talk Ooh
""
""
and what is this big animal He looks and jabs the elephant with a moist finger and attacks the problem of speech with sounds that will soon be shaped to a language I know
But restless now he turns his gaze from the book to my face then with motives I can not fathom he slips off my lap and with spraddled legs and sagging diaper lurches away through the golden light
With a sudden catch at my heart I find myself brimming with love and vague premonition
Old bones not my own stir softly inside me
How I wonder might my mother s father have asked these questions and his lineage before him I have thought sometimes of those movie scenes in which the scion of some great family paces the portrait gallery of his ancestors where generation upon generation recedes from the brightly lighted present toward line is to halt at the edge of this century the ocean and an unknown tongue
Across the gulf of history geography and language my people can not speak to me and in my mind s eye is no receding gallery but only the brief reaches of childhood memory
In the foreground stands my mother whose voice I know in the middle distance my grandfather whose voice I hear but can not understand and at his back only a dark and vacant tunnel of time
II
For years I have intermittently tried to reconstruct my grandfather s image from fragments of memory and casual bits of testimony in family lore
Only twice do I remember did he ever even notice me I was eight that summer although there must have been other times earlier that I can not recall
But one day that summer I drew near him as he sat in the glassedin front porch of the little frame house reading as he often did from and was proud of my skill but a glance at the page defeated me as had the alien speech that my mother revived in herself each time we visited
Looking up he gripped my shoulder with a sudden hand and drew me to him
I remember the furrowed face dark and suddenly close the faintly leathery smell of him it was probably the great leatherbound Bible and the faded blue eyes looking into mine
Then with one hand on the page and the other on my shoulder he began to read to me a harsh voice rolling over the strange syllables as his finger moved down the page
Uncomfortable I endured a few moments before I pulled away
This was in Hancock Michigan in 
We were there my mother and I for most of that summer
Usually we came for summer visits of a week or so my father s vacation from our home in southern Michigan near the Indiana border to hillside above Portage Lake and the ship canal facing its sister city of Houghton across the water
But this summer we stayed on while my father went home it was well past the Fourth of July I know because I remember hearing from my bed the celebratory dynamite blasts beyond the edge of town a blasting tradition that remained even though the mines were closed
There had been other visits too at least one in the winter my mother and I when I was three and my father was out of work but I have only shards of memory of those times chiefly of a Christmas tree with actual candles and of a long swooping nighttime sled ride with my mother down the Quincy Hill past my grandparents home and around the corner into Summit Street where my aunt lived
My mother was young then not yet thirty and she pulled me on the sled up the long Quincy Hill to the top where the old mine buildings still intense I can recall it only as a kind of pressure around me and the long glide down the hill toward the streetlights below was a course through cold tangible in the glittering and shadowy air
My mother tried to get me to walk the few blocks back to my grandparents house but I kept sitting down in the snow
Finally she pulled me on the sled
Then at last I was undressed drowsing in front of the warm kitchen range and laid in bed with a hot brick at my feet
Perhaps the dream came that night
Certainly it came from some time well before my age of continuous memory a vivid and curious dream a dream that returned it seems often and that registered itself powerfully not so much in my mind as on my body
I was deep in a cave far beneath my grandfather s house and was trying to escape through a tiny opening a tight tunnel that I tried to wriggle through I I strained to force my way out
Years later in college I identified this as a birth dream some urgent reconstruction of primal experience in the only terms my imagination could then present to me
By the time I understood it it had been neutralized an academic item only and it did not recur I sometimes cited it for my students as an instance of unconscious memory
But I can remember when it did come waking frightened lying awake and wondering what happened next It seemed that I ought somehow to emerge in my grandfather s basement where the family was gathered in the summer kitchen and sit down at the table among them
Well here I am I would say
III
My grandfather was a dark Finn short and spare and in his later years little more than a scrap of twisted leather topped with a shock of irongray hair
His stock was unmixed with the fair and tall Scandinavian type of the other northern are Scandinavian only by accident of geography migration and recent history their ancestral home was central Russia their ancient cousins by another migration became the Magyars of modern Hungary and dark skin and hair and short stature mark these origins in many Finns
Within the culture Suomi is the traditional name for the language and the nation Tacitus the first outsider to record notice of them wrote of a wild and primitive people called Fenni and Finland has been a name imposed on the maps at least since a period of Swedish domination
A later emigration brought many Finns to this country at the turn of the century many to escape Russian domination Finland then being a Russian province and many to find work in the mines and forests of Michigan Wisconsin and Minnesota
Even here they were ethnically distinct and at the bottom of the immigrant hierarchy in some lumber camps the Finns were forced to eat at their own tables the blacks of Scandinavian America How did the Finns come to America Took a bath and floated across on the scum
Doubtless the canard originated in their darker coloring and their determination to stay clean that is in their ritual devotion to the sauna which has become their contribution to American yuppie indulgence
No indulgence for the Finns rather a sauna was such a necessity that it was often the first building erected on the tiny farms they cleared
In the towns neighborhood saunas were quickly established and makeshift home saunas were cobbled into many basements and garages
The sauna bath was a family occasion like Sunday dinner and often a social occasion among friends
My uncle had a summer home on the ship canal that extension of Portage Lake that permits Great Lakes shipping a shortcut through the Keweenaw Peninsula
There was a sauna at the water s edge and on weekend visits it was my grandfather s privilege to start the fire early in the afternoon and to tend it in the stove improvised
It was his privilege too to make the bathing switches not of the traditional birch twigs but of the fragrant tips of white cedar which grew along that shore
I would see the plume of blue from the chimney smell the wood smoke rich on the air while my grandfather moved among the trees cutting cedar tips with his pocketknife
And it was his privilege finally to be the first to enter and bathe no one could stand the heat he could endure alone on the highest bench near the ceiling
Later would come the younger men and last the women and children
The heat entranced me
I sucked it deep into my lungs where it warmed my vitals from the inside out and I clambered to the highest bench where I sat moist and hot and glassyeyed until my alarmed mother pulled me down and scrubbed me with soap and the fragrant cedar switches
The hardy would end with a plunge in the waters of the canal themselves with a sloshing rinse with buckets drawn from the end of the dock
At night in bed and in my pajamas I could still catch faintly the cedar smell on my skin
What specifically drew my grandfather from Finland to Michigan s Upper Peninsula I never learned
Probably the life he left was so hard that anything would have seemed better
He was a farmer but he had served in the Russian army and my mother can remember him demonstrating the manual of arms with a broom
A brother had preceded him to the new world and apparently the news was good enough to persuade my grandfather to take the leap probably about 
He left behind his wife and infant daughter my oldest aunt who would not be able to join him for several years
His brother went back to Finland but my grandfather worked for a time in a Detroit factory before making his way to the north where many Scandinavians had found a climate and a landscape to remind the community of Salo for a while where my mother was born and taken directly to the sauna for her first bath
I have walked those fields near Salo in the few places between rock and swamp it is possible to scrape in the earth and raise a little hay feed a cow or two and coax along a few vegetables in the brief summers
But inevitably my grandfather was drawn into the copper mines in the years before the First World War
By that time he was already middleaged
Great veins of copper run through the rocky ridges of the Keweenaw Peninsula and over one of them was developed the Quincy Mine
The operating capital of course came from investors in the East and there has now been written an official history of the mine which is long on the accomplishments of the investors and managers but short on the lives of the men who mined the ore
The mine had already a long record of intermittently profitable operations by the time my grandfather the mine and began the grueling daily underground labor to see what profit he might wring from the rock
It must have been frighteningly unnatural work to begin so late in his life
As a farmer he had risen in dark and worked through the brightness of day to the night again but now darkness claimed him the day round
The workday was twelve hours
In the winter he would see daylight only on Sundays
Few of the Finns were originally miners only the immigrants from Wales and Cornwall brought their profession with them along with the Cornish pastie the halfmoonshaped meat pie that could be heated in morning and remain warm in the lunch pail until midday
The Finns soon adopted these with their new work and for twenty and more years my grandfather left each morning with his hot lunch pail for the climb up the hill to the Quincy Mine to the daily descent into the pit
It was brutal work
Only as my own body loses its resilience in middle age have been
From time to time the workers struck of course my mother s earliest memory is of abandoned lunch pails along Quincy Hill where the violence of the strike intercepted those who were trying to go to work before they could reach the mine
Sometimes a man would come home with his arm hanging limp his shoulder dislocated from swinging a pick or sledge a capable wife would put her man on the kitchen floor and with one foot braced each against his neck and armpit pull and ease the shoulder joint back into place
Shafts would sometimes collapse and the falling rock would shoot the compressed air out the opening of the mine shaft in a great air blast heard in the homes below
And then the families would wait my mother can remember lying with her ear to the basement floor hoping to hear the miners hundreds of feet below
Other dangers came more slowly and insidiously
My grandfather wheezed with what was called miners bronchitis probably silicosis years to kill him
IV
How can I reconstruct his later life The Quincy Mine closed in the Depression a victim of declining demand and the cheaper production from the openpit mines of Montana and Arizona
Social Security was legislated in time to give him a small retirement income
In his entire life he never drove an automobile used a telephone sent a telegram or owned a radio
His Bible and the Finnishlanguage newspaper were his sole windows on the world
Most of his family and his wife s had remained in Finland and now he was doubly isolated for his children had married and left home flowing into the mainstream of Englishspeaking life
He and my grandmother never learned English the Finnishspeaking community was vital enough to hold them enclosed all their lives
I never understood a word either of them ever said to me except that my grandmother could approximate my name Veeli she would call Veeli boyga I can still recognize vowels although it is empty of meaning for me
The talk during those summer visits surged back and forth between the two languages as my mother and my aunts deferred in turn to their parents and to the children and husbands who spoke no Finn
Mostly we gathered for meals in the basement which became a summer kitchen with a door into the backyard
My grandmother was voluble and merry but my grandfather would sit at one end of the table usually silent unless spoken to while the conversation flowed mainly among the women in both languages
He was not so much sunk in the silence of the listener or spectator as he was withdrawn elsewhere
There is some claim a distinctive Finnish gaze in which some Finns simply are not with you for a while their eyes focused somewhere beyond you on an inner horizon
My grandfather had it as he drifted back perhaps beyond the long curve of the globe and the receding years to some remote gatherings of did in mine
Returning he would drink his coffee from his saucer sometimes sucking it through a cube of sugar held in his teeth
It was the only indulgence I ever saw in his life
Late in that summer a truckload of slabwood was dumped in the backyard and in the afternoons he would split firewood to stovesize pieces and carry them into the basement to stack against the wall
My mother told me that by the time of cold weather he would have the basement filled from floor to ceiling with wood for the kitchen cookstove the only heat the house would have
I sat one afternoon on the back steps watching him
He would balance the thin wide piece of slabwood on the splitting block and with precise strokes of his ax reduce it to a few pieces of cookstove size tossing them into a pile at one side
He gave no sign he knew I was there
I got out my pocketknife and began to whittle on one of the odd pieces of a few dimes extorted from my mother and had three blades and a celluloid grip in a swirl of blue brown and red
I thought it powerfully beautiful
Then I was aware of my grandfather standing over me his dark hand thrust out
In the palm lay his knife larger and ancient it seemed but with a handle in the same swirl of blue and brown and red
A smile cracked across his face and there was a pattern of lines etched there I had never seen before
For a moment we looked at each other I still seated he leaning on his ax his other hand extended
Then he reached for a bushel basket nearby picked up a few kindling chips from the ground around the splitting block and motioned me to take over
After I had filled the kindling box in the basement I helped him carry in the split wood for the stove and stack it against the wall
Our work finished we stepped together backyard
I felt a hand on my shoulder his voice cracked and rasped
Veeli he said
Veeli boyga
""
I never saw him again
We did not make a visit the next year then World War II began travel was restricted and he died in late winter two years after
My grandmother followed him a few winters later
I remember the telegrams the vacancy of my mother s absence for a week or so the unintelligibility of a death so remote
Memories of my grandfather drifted to the margins of my consciousness for many years except for a few provocations
I knew that he and I bore the same middle name
An older cousin once happened to remark that of all the cousins I most resembled him
And I remembered years earlier hearing her father say that my grandfather was in his way a very learned man a lay scholar of the Bible
As the two observations coalesced I felt a line of him not only my name my facial structure my coloring but my love of the book and of the word if not his faith in the Book and the Word
And I never knew until my wife told me how characteristic were my moments of abstraction when she would pass her hand between my gaze and my own inner horizon
But as the fullness of time brought me my children s children I could feel him stalking nearer within me and as I looked out over my own privileged life I could look in more and more upon the bafflement resignation and consolations that must have been his
Now has age brought me full circle to find my grandfather in myself as I seek myself in my grandson
V
So fortyodd years after I returned this past summer to find that little frame house on the street rising up to the old mine
For more than a decade I have had a summer cabin in the north half a thoughts prevented my return to my grandparents house
It was I finally understood something I had been putting off for a long time
The house itself had been so altered by successive remodelings that at first I did not find it but instead found the one next door which was identical except that the floor plan was reversed in it I met a man older than myself who remembered my uncle
No one was at home at the unrecognizable house next door so I went on up the hill to the site of the Quincy Mine which now had become a historical exhibit to attract tourists one of which I was
There I confronted at a remove of two generations something of the reality of that killing life of the hardrock miner
A pleasant young man guided our tour group from the gift shop into the hoist room still housing the great steam hoist the heart of the old Quincy operation and the glory of the presentday museum
It was a impressive even now in its repose towering three stories above the floor we stood upon
The guide s voice drifted away into the silence overhead and I tried to imagine the din of this room years ago
Clanking and hissing as huge pressures of steam fed through its cylinders the hoist turned a great doubleconed drum that reeled and unreeled miles of steel cable through a towerandpulley system high overhead to the mine shaft itself a hundred yards away
Here it was that my grandfather had gone underground with others like himself in small cars connected to the great hoist by the long and lengthening umbilical cord on which their lives depended
They dropped not straight down as on an elevator but down on rails at a steep angle into the hillside cable cars under controlled descent
Down they would roll in their little cars leaning back against the slope as the cable lowered them a mile or more back down the hill they had just walked up to work but now beneath the very rock face with their drills and hammers and pickaxes fighting off the dark with their carbide lamps and heaving the ore into cars that were hauled back up the track they had come down
The deeper shafts were baled of seeping water by special cars that scooped huge dripping loads from the flooded chambers and discharged them at the mine head
At the end of the shift the men were retrieved a more precious cargo drawn back up the dripping shafts and delivered to the day or night to walk back down the hill to their homes below
Old photographs of the mining crews stare back at me from the museum walls anonymous faces sullen and apprehensive of men young and in their middle age
I could not have recognized my grandfather had he been among them
The abandoned shafts are inaccessible now closed for safety and much of the network of low tunnels and narrow chambers the miners groped through by their flaring lamps now lies dark and silent under tons of settled retired grateful no doubt not to have to face the daily entombment that the old job entailed
The younger men drifted into different jobs or left town and the town itself ceased to grow declined found a new stability of a lower order sustaining itself on tourists a little lumbering a growing college across the lake
No one s sons and grandsons would become miners and no one s daughters would marry into the mines my aunts and uncle and mother all left in time finding their way to college and jobs in the southern part of the state
The copper ore is still there but too deep to be produced at a profit
Thus to the slow fluctuations of economic law do I owe my own good fortune not to have been a miner s son as well as grandson and not to have gone into the mines myself
Further on up the peninsula is the older Delaware Mine now open to the public its first level only it
Down wooden steps at a steep angle we descend a mere sixty feet or so but the chill the damp the dripping rock the smell of enclosed moisture drive into my bones a sudden realization of what the grave must be
A string of dim lights lets the tourist see more clearly than the miners ever did the sloping caverns and narrow tunnels where they worked their days away
From one vantage point we can see the water flooding the levels below a tossed pebble plunks into the dark water ripples spread away into blackness
Our guide turns out the lights for a moment and jokingly gets us to see a ghost some persistence on the retina of the vanished light
Other ghosts stir in me in the flooded tunnels hundreds of feet below here and at Quincy and at all the abandoned mines of this ancient and rocky land ghostly miners toil slowly like deepsea divers in depths no one will ever see again at one with rock and water and my neck and shoulders a bursting of my lungs as I strain upward and outward through dark waterfilled tunnels toward some light at the back of my mind
Our guide turns on the light and in a selfconscious shuffle our group begins the climb back to the surface our claustrophobia palpable among us
We have been underground for twenty minutes
The chill is still deep in my body and I think I understand what my grandfather sought to drive out with the fiercest heat of the sauna
Later my wife and I found our way to the small cemetery on the hillside above the lake where my grandfather lay buried my grandmother beside him
It was a hot day for Hancock we sweat in our summer clothes
Part of the cemetery the newer part was neat and well tended it had been endowed for perpetual care the grounds keeper explained
The older section was overgrown and unkempt formerly families had tended the plots but two generations had grown one to remember their dead
The grounds keeper consulted a rusty box of file cards and led us to the plot in his pickup truck from the truck bed he pulled out a power mower and cut away the weeds and brambles over a small granite marker set flush with the earth
Names and year of death only
My oldest aunt had laid the marker I assumed the summer after my grandmother s death
To dig the winter ground is deadly hard work and even today winter dead are stored for spring burial and brought to the cemetery tiers of coffins on a flatbed truck to be lowered into an earth now soft enough to receive them
My mother had never been able to visit the grave so for her sake we took a picture
My wife borrowed a yellow rose from a nearby memorial basket and laid it across the stone
Standing at his feet feeling the tug of mortality at my bones I thought of my grandfather lying still and patient in waiting in sure and certain hope of the resurrection
The old dream flickered again behind my eyes and for a moment he surfaces in my arms like a drowned man I sink like one into his and I am dreaming of my grandfather dreaming my dream
Deep beneath the earth in dark waterfilled caves we struggle upward together in tight embrace toward the day
But as quickly as they coalesce the dreams diverge and something has been exchanged
The dream of birth remains with him and I am left with another I like less well
I stoop to return the rose to its rightful place
The summer sun is hot on my shoulders but it does not reach deep enough to soothe a shudder at my heart
VI
How those early days have marked me I understand only as I age
After my grandmother s death my mother never returned to her childhood home
Even now she is reluctant to talk of the old times and I can
In later years I have lived in California in the Northwest and in the South but in time an inner compass asserted itself and I turned my face again and again to the North
A modest affluence and a profession neither of which my grandfather could have imagined permit me to spend my summers reading and writing in a summer home on a lake where I have a leisure beyond his conception for the book and the word
But I do not spend my winters in this land nor do I want to
My daughter brings my grandson to visit on vacation
On my lap he will sit turning pages of book after book with me and I know that as he struggles toward words over bright pictures he will grasp a language that we share
The love of the book and of the word is grounded here
And I wonder what dreams from his childhood will connect him to me
Perhaps he will dream of great gray elephants swaying through birch groves bathed to time of dark passages but I doubt that this is a dream of birth
The sun has passed from the lake and as we sit in the gathering darkness voices fall silent and the evening chill descends on us
My grandson has clambered back up into my chair and lies sleeping against my chest I have wrapped my arms about him against the cold and we rest in a bonded warmth in the darkening night air
I am suddenly aware that my wife stands by my chair puts her hand on my arm
Why do nt you start a fire she says
She takes the child from me with practiced grasp he starts slightly then sinks into deeper sleep
I stir myself to lay kindling in the Franklin stove and soon the family drifts inside as the firelight leaps and glints about the room
I go outside for more wood where it is stacked in the crawl space beneath the porch the stove is our only source of heat exercise a recreation just so edged with necessity as to flavor the labor with both pleasure and virtue
No one as yet sits on the steps whittling with his pocketknife waiting to gather chips
I gauge the size of the crawl space in my mind it has never been filled but a small person can stand upright in it and might get back into places too narrow for me to reach
My arms loaded with wood I pause to look out over the darkening lake
For years we have talked of building a sauna
A friend has given me a makeshift stove welded up from scrap metal and I have plans for the building on paper
Perhaps I will stake it out next summer
There is plenty of firewood and birch trees aplenty for the traditional birch switches
But I have my eye on a stand of white cedars just down the road and as I turn back into the glowing cabin I wonder how much of the ancient heat I for those who will follow me

Section REAPPRAISAL
My starting point is a query put to me by an editor
Andr Gide
""
""
seems from here in America rather small and beside the point
Is that how it looks from where you are
""
""
Odd with homosexuality now something like a small political movement one would have thought much more would have been made of Gide who very early uncloseted himself
Gide does seem by now some forty years after his death a relatively forgotten figure although there is still of course a Gidian academic industry
During the second half of his long career he was the best known of all contemporary French writers
As the house genius of La Nouvelle Revue Franaise he was at the center of French literary life and he was also widely known throughout Europe as was confirmed by his being awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 
Although he always claimed to be primarily an artist three main subjects of general human interest outside sports religion sex and politics
Gide had grown up as a fervent Protestant and it took him a long time and much heart searching to work his way through to agnosticism
He was a married man who eventually felt an obligation to proclaim his homosexuality
After being largely indifferent to politics in his earlier years he became a prominent anticolonialist as a consequence of a trip to the Congo
When the Nazi threat loomed he threw in his lot with the Communists but only to recant almost immediately after a visit to the Soviet Union enlightened him about the shortcomings of Stalinism
Gide s very topicality as a writer involved in so many contemporary issues meant that once he was dead and circumstances began to change his celebrity would inevitably begin to wane at least until the emergence of some consensus about the quality durable or otherwise of his literary works
My feeling is that such a consensus has sexual issue it has to be emphasized that in his day Gide was seen as a general liberator rather than as a specialist defender of homosexual rights
When I was a student in France before the war he was very popular with most young people who read his little book Les Nourritures terrestres as a sort of pagan New Testament calling on them to revolt against the religious and moral conventions of French bourgeois society and to achieve the fullest possible expression of their individual temperaments
The students I knew did nt pay much attention to Gide s homosexuality that was just a personal quirk that he was entitled to indulge in if he felt so inclined
What interested them was the slogan Familles je vous hais and the general thrill of liberation from the stuffiness of French conformism
Gide preached spontaneity nakedness in the sun appreciation of the joys of the moment and exposure to exotic cultural influences beyond the borders of France
It seemed to me that different ways G B Shaw H G Wells and especially D H Lawrence had done for the English
If he appeared rather more subtle and elegant than the English writers this was because he could nt help being in himself an exquisite product of the high bourgeois culture he was subverting not to mention his quixotic charm as a rentier prepared to saw off the branch he was sitting on
I respected his attempt at honesty I thought his influence to be all for the good provided some of his suggestions were not taken too literally but my northern workingclass cynicism made me doubt whether he could have been so lyrically free and so willing to trust nature rather than culture had he not been permanently cushioned by a private income which is a cultural not a natural circumstance
To do Gide justice he eventually realized this himself as can be seen from some late diary entries but by then his philosophy such as it is had been figure out for themselves how far they could live by it in the workaday world
Not only was Gide thought of primarily as a general liberator none of his enthusiastic readers so far as I know ever espoused his homosexual cause
In any case he launched it rather late in life he was already fiftythree when he took the bold step of publishing Corydon his theoretical defense of homosexuality and fiftysix when he admitted his own involvement in his autobiography Si le grain ne meurt
The opposition understandably was fierce he was at once condemned by orthodox Catholics and coldshouldered by other contemporaries
There is a famous anecdote about Paul Claudel who had hoped to convert him from Protestantism to Catholicism pointing one mealtime to a pan in which something was being flambed and proclaiming That is how Gide will sizzle in Hell Gide s homosexual friends showed no eagerness to risk public obloquy while the heterosexual ones tended to turn a deplored it in private
One friend whom I met after the war had been careful to keep his son out of reach of Gide s attentions
Another told me it was rather a strain accompanying the great man to the cinema because he would keep changing his seat to sidle up to some promising youth glimpsed in the shadows
This was said with a rueful smile as if Gide s elderly promiscuity were an embarrassing but forgivable weakness
No doubt Gide s frankness encouraged a later generation of French writers Roland Barthes Michel Foucault Michel Tournier Mathieu Galley and others to accept their homosexuality more willingly than they might otherwise have done but either through discretion or a lack of conviction none of them has written as explicitly in his own defense as Gide did
Nor has any of them discussed Gide s apologia at any length
All in all Gide in spite of his liberating influence has not been the homosexual beacon one might have expected
that what he practiced and advocated was pederasty
This is different in kind from the equal partnership between consenting adults which I take to be the dominant militant form of male homosexuality at the present time
There is no suggestion anywhere in Gide s writings that he ever had a sexual relationship with a person of his own age apart from some hankypanky under the dining room table with the concierge s son when they were both toddlers
His first experiences were with Arab adolescents or preadolescents in North Africa as he explains in his autobiography
He was in his early twenties at the time and in a state of heightened sensibility because of incipient tuberculosis
With his friend Paul Laurens he was sharing the favors of a female prostitute when he discovered that he derived more sensual and lyrical satisfaction from consorting with an Arab boy who offered his services
What these services were exactly is not explained
Gide mentions incidentally that he had a horror of sodomy and he frequently states without defining the term
Since he also says that he could prolong the ecstasy on his own after his Arab partner had left him one must suppose that his idea of sexual bliss was some form of mutual or simultaneous masturbation
Although he had favorites among the Arab boys their identities were not important since they were interchangeable this fits in with his repeated assertion that he felt love for his wife but only desire for boys
His diary shows that he later went on to find sexual satisfaction in many other places besides Africa Italy Corsica Paris Marseille and so forth
He admits somewhere that one of the reasons why he could never settle for any length of time at Cuverville the country house in Normandy where his wife lived was the difficulty of finding opportunities for sex in an area where he was well known
Indeed a constant theme in his diary is the need to get away from Cuverville he must have been one of the most who lived least often in his own home
His comments on his roving sex life vary and are not always as lyrical as the account of his first experiences given in the autobiography
Sometimes his chief feeling is one of relief at being purged of desire so that he can turn his mind to other things
Occasionally he expresses revulsion at the indignity of looking for satisfaction in the back streets of big cities and wishes that he had not got used to the nomadic life which is difficult to reconcile with steady concentration on literary work
But one important moral point that he never mentions anywhere so far as I can discover is that most if not all of these casual encounters must have been based on payment
His sex life presumably depended for a large part on prostitution and on what would legally count at least in Europe as corruption of minors even if the minors in question were willing to oblige
Perhaps Gide just took it for both parties or perhaps he was concentrating so singlemindedly on his own pleasure that he remained oblivious of the moral issue as it concerned the boy prostitutes
Apparently his behavior never got him into trouble in France where in any case la police des moeurs is chary of pursuing eminent literary figures but the fact remains that the morality of adolescent prostitution is an issue that the advocates of this kind of homosexuality should logically consider
Also while Gide s pederasty may never have crossed the border into pedophilia the dividing line between the two practices is probably uncertain and therefore needs to be discussed
Whether Gide s conscience was absolutely clear on this point remains an open question the diary contains many curious references to his being egged on by the Devil but whether these are genuine twinges of remorse or just ironical asides to himself it is impossible to say they may not even be connected with the sexual issue
When he published Corydon in after years of cogitation friends it found no ardent supporters and it has never been one of his widely discussed texts
The explanation may be that it was immediately overshadowed by Si le grain ne meurt which tells his personal story in the most limpid classical way without any intrusion of theoretical considerations
Although he always claimed that the value of Corydon would eventually be recognized it still strikes me today as a muddled unevenly argued little book
Since as a homosexual he had not yet come out it is not a direct statement it takes the form of a dialogue in which a sniffy carping narrator is asking a selfconfessed pederast Corydon to justify his proclivities
From the start Corydon is naively presented as a distinguished figure greatly superior to his interlocutor in manner intelligence and knowledge
His first response is to describe how he discovered his homosexuality
He was engaged to be married to a girl whom he loved so deeply that she to Gide s own frequently expressed spiritual attachment to Madeleine Rondeau the cousin who became his wife
In spite of some disturbing intimations Corydon assumed that his indifference to other women was a sign of his chaste devotion to his fiancee
Then during his courtship he noticed that his betrothed s young brother Alexis was becoming increasingly attached to him
Eventually Alexis made open advances Corydon spurned them indignantly as being effeminate and urged Alexis to seek salvation in the love of a good woman
But Alexis after giving final expression to his feelings in a letter committed suicide thus revealing to Corydon both the authenticity of homoerotic emotion and his own latent tendencies
Corydon broke off his engagement and decided to devote himself to proving to other homosexuals like Alexis had done that what they may feel ashamed of as an anomaly is in fact an innocent natural appetite that has always existed
We are not told how the lady concerned reacted to these events still young
""
This little fiction seems to be a romantic transposition of Gide s first encounter with the Arab boy
It is a fact attested by various sources that in all sexual relationships an adult may be enticed into involvement by a precocious child or adolescent
But it still remains to be shown in what sense homosexuality is natural
""
The simple answer that Corydon gives in the first place is as might be expected that no human tendency can be outside Nature Nature taken in the widest sense is just that which is
Corydon adds oddly enough that the only unnatural thing he recognizes is the work of art
This seems illogical because if it is in man s nature to produce art then art itself is only an extension of human nature and its supposed artificiality is just Nature at one remove
However be that as it may I am not sure that Corydon or Gide ever sees clearly that Nature is could equally well invoke it to justify his undoubtedly inherent impulses
In the eighteenth century when the idea of Nature was at its most fashionable the Marquis de Sade did precisely this he stood the Rousseauistic concept of good Nature on its head and argued with mad conviction that strong individuals have a right or even a duty to work out their aggressive natures to the full particularly as regards sex
Gide is not one of the hysterical modern admirers of Sade but as I shall argue later he has some neoSadian or neoNietzschean features that complicate his attempt to extend the range of virtuous Nature without going so far as to abolish morality altogether
Next Corydon proceeds to emphasize the complexities of sexuality in the vegetable and animal kingdoms
This is a vast and complicated subject that he summarizes very rapidly with the obvious intention of destroying the illusion that there is any neat arrangement in Nature for the sure conjunction of man and woman
The division into takes innumerable forms
Basically however the female is the essential partner who ensures the continuity of the race the male who evolved to supply genetic variety is an addition a sport even a luxury
One might have thought that GideCorydon who was so well versed in the Bible would have pointed out that this is a striking reversal of the Adam s rib story which derives the female from the male but he does nt do so
""
Secondly Corydon says the sexual instinct is not focused primarily on reproduction
The initial prompting is towards pleasure and procreation is a byproduct
Because the sexual process is such a hitormiss affair Nature overinsures by supplying more eggs and far more male seed than is technically necessary
The notion that there is any simple balance between male and female either in the animal species or in the human race has according to Corydon to be abandoned
In addition to the supposedly normal be found
Homosexuality is one of them it has always existed not only among humans but also among some animals even when the opportunity for heterosexual behavior is present
Incidentally if there is no reliable balance in Nature this means that Papageno s charming aria in The Magic Flute Ein Mann ein Weib ein Weib ein Mann is not expressing a simple natural truth as one might suppose but a secondary socially conditioned aspiration or idealization
""
This first zoological part of the thesis boils down to saying that homosexuality is a recurrent phenomenon in the jumbled wasteful processes of Nature and just has to be accepted in the first place as one of the given mysteries
This is no doubt very true but as I have already suggested the same can be said initially about all human tendencies of whatever kind including those of inverts a term that CorydonGide always uses disparagingly
Morality only begins at the of Nature favoring some and suppressing others in the supposed interest of the general good
As it happens Gide formulates Corydon s naturalistic claim more bluntly in a short diary entry In the name of what God or what ideal do you forbid me to live according to my nature If the Marquis de Sade had put this question the humanistic answer would have been God does nt come into it
It is antisocial to torture prostitutes even if your nature urges you to do so
Homosexuality is not so clear a case since it does not necessarily involve physical persecution of the other partner
But if Nature is as indefinite as Gide says pederasty may be infectious or habitforming with debatable consequences for the good of society or the happiness of the individual
Contemporary European society has on the whole moved to the position of recognizing homosexual relations between consenting adults as an innocent fulfillment of their nature but there is still a question mark against to deal with this
He prefaces his consideration of the social aspect of the problem by repeating the point about desire not being primarily geared to reproduction
He presents sexual arousal in the first place as a sort of extension of universal narcissism I believe excuse my boldness that in both sexes homosexuality is more spontaneous more naive than heterosexuality
Heterosexual activity he says has almost to be learned witness the legend of Daphnis and Chloe in which the young man can not perform properly until he has been initiated by an older woman
No wonder then that in certain periods of civilization and particularly in ancient Greece pederasty was considered at least as normal an outlet for the superfluity of male desire as heterosexuality and was regulated accordingly
Also given that the male principle represents sport and luxury in Nature it is not surprising that homosexuality should have been especially present in times of great artistic production such as the Renaissance in Florence or himself whether Florentine or Shakespearian homosexuality was of the adult kind or not
He just assumes that pederasty is the dominant form of the deviance and warming to his theme argues that a bisexual society on the model of ancient Greece is preferable to the officially heterosexual society of Western Europe where young men are exposed to the dangers of female prostitution of vulgar company and disease
I think that a friend even in the most Greek sense of the word is more advisable for an adolescent than a female lover
""
""
""
I maintain that peace in the home family respectability and the health of husband and wife were more securely preserved by Greek sexual mores than they are by ours
He was writing of course at a time when syphilis was still the sexual plague not AIDS
Under the Greek system Corydon explains young men were subject to the civilizing influence of an older male lover roughly from the ages of thirteen to twentythree and explain what happened after that were most grown men permanently converted to heterosexuality or while founding a family did they repeat the cycle by taking a young lover on the side Nor does Corydon tell us what the women thought of this particularly the young girls deprived of their male contemporaries between the ages of thirteen and twentythree
It makes one reflect that Socrates Xanthippe may have had a good feminist reason for being a shrew
And while Corydon accords the female the honor of being the guarantor of the species this does not prevent him from expressing himself as an unconscious male chauvinist and he makes some strange remarks about both women and young men
If the adolescent falls into the hands of a woman this may spell disaster for him alas There are only too many examples of this
But since at such a tender age an adolescent can only be a fairly mediocre lover it is fortunately unnatural that a woman should fall in love with him the helpful role played by the mature lady in the Daphnis and Chloe legend
Second it is an odd opinion to have been penned by Gide a great admirer of Racine whose Phdre is all about the fierce naturally unnatural passion of an older woman for an adolescent unless of course Racine was a closet queen and Phaedra a male lover in disguise but neither Gide nor anyone else so far as I know has ever suggested this
Third if an adolescent is a mediocre lover with a woman in what sense can he be a satisfactory one with a man unless the younger partner is expected to play no more than a totally passive role
This second part of Corydon is so open to criticism that one can easily understand why the book has had little influence
There may well be a valid case for pederasty or at least for extending freedom of sexual choice to all individuals from puberty onwards s idealized picture of Greek sexuality is not altogether borne out by such specialist studies as those of J K Dover and in any case it disregards the historical change in the status of women
It goes far beyond the usual claim of modern homosexuals that they are a minority entitled to the same rights as the heterosexual majority
And even if we accept that Gide may have been reacting to the defects and hypocrisies of latenineteenthcentury society it seems incredible that he should advocate the segregation of boys and girls at a time when their sexual drive is at its strongest and a fair proportion of them mate for life
Perhaps he was tempted to be provocative and paradoxical since he was hiding behind the persona of Corydon
Even so the book remains very unsatisfactory surprisingly so given Andr Gide s general ability
In his direct confessional writings such as Si le grain ne meurt and the diary Gide is predominantly descriptive not propagandist and the picture he gives of his probably numerically limited category of pederasts
His main peculiarity was not as it happened his interest in boys but the fact that he combined this interest with the platonic adoration of his cousin Madeleine whom he had known since childhood and had always assumed he would marry
The chaste semireligious fixation on an idealized female figure it might be called the Beatrice Complex is a variety of neocourtly love that occurs in the makeup of a number of other latenineteenthcentury French authors notably Paul Claudel and AlainFournier neither of whom however was homosexual
In Gide s case it was particularly strong and coincided with his early religious fervor
One may wonder to what extent if any he saw the young Madeleine as a real woman of flesh and blood he writes about her as if she were part religious icon and part nonsexual mother substitute
After his first homosexual experiences he consulted a doctor who assured him that marriage would cure him of him why she hesitated is not made clear but she eventually did so shortly after his mother s death
Sexually the marriage was a failure from the start
He does nt say whether he actually tried to consummate it but in the extraordinary confession he wrote after Madeleine s death Et nunc manet in te he reveals that he regularly consorted with boys during their Mediterranean honeymoon leaving her to amuse herself as she thought fit
It may be that she was frigid having been affected in adolescence by her mother s infidelity to her father
Gide gives two brilliantly written accounts of this family crisis one in his autobiography and the other in the novel La Porte troite but he was obviously unable to help Madeleine to get over its effects if effects there were
In La Porte troite he piously deplores the cruel blow inflicted on the heroine by her mother s behavior but he does nt seem to have reflected at that stage pain
Late in life Gide confided in Albert Camus that he had been ignorant that women have sexual urges and needs
This is hard to credit since female sexual desire is a common enough theme in French literature and in French schoolboy conversation
Perhaps he meant that he had put Madeleine on such a pedestal that he could nt imagine her to have ordinary appetites
He certainly keeps repeating that his deep love for her was in no way diminished by his pagan lust for boys as if there were no common denominator between the two feelings
However it is not easy to understand what he meant by love since he also says that he and she never once discussed the sexual question
What confidence can there have been between them and in what sense was he a loving husband if he could proclaim his homosexuality and put her into an acutely embarrassing position as his wife without first asking her permission to do so In Et nunc manet in te and well he might
Whatever his courage in coming out he must have known that he was pursuing his chosen course with Sadian or Nietzschean ruthlessness as far as she was concerned indeed he transparently admits as much both by the contents and the title of the novel LImmoraliste and this can not enhance his acceptability as a model in the cause of homosexuality
There are two further complications in Gide s peculiar sexuality
About the time of the war he broke his own rule about only desiring boys by actually falling in love with one at least for a time
This was Marc Allgret who figures in the diary and more prominently in Les Cahiers de la Petite Dame the Boswelllike account of Gide kept by his lifelong friend Mme Tho van Rysselberghe
The relationship with Marc Allgret was probably the nearest Gide ever came to the Greek ideal of mature mentor and loverpupil as described in Corydon which he must have have been the last straw for Madeleine and when against her wishes Gide accompanied Marc on a visit to England she took her revenge by burning all the letters he had ever written to her
He presents this as a terrible tragedy because he claimed to have put the best of himself into the correspondence but how could he if he had never been frank with her and adds It was as if she had killed our child a strange phrase that implies that he saw his writing as the fruit of his womb that she had served to fertilize through a curious inversion of roles
One can not help suspecting that consciously or unconsciously he got his own back later in fact soon afterwards by having a real child with Mme Tho s unmarried daughter Elizabeth
This act of procreation by a famous homosexual remains completely mysterious the great confessionalist himself is mute on the subject and those of his friends whom I heard no indication that he was in love with Elizabeth and even if he were politely acceding to her request to have a child he must have known that Madeleine would be bitterly hurt so once again his morality appears very uncertain
It is almost as if at times he were conscientiously trying to be wicked in order to prove to himself that he was free beyond good and evil
As Mme Tho records in her deadpan way even at the height of his involvement with Marc and during the fateful stay in Grantchester he seduced another boy at the school that Marc was attending the boy told his parents and there was a slight scandal which had to be hushed up
When Marc reproachfully asked Why did you do it Uncle Gide he received the significant reply Par acquit de conscience to soothe or clear my conscience
In other words Gide was so intent on experiencing life to the full every passing whim without allowing moral considerations to intervene
This corresponds to a principle enunciated in Les Nourritures terrestres act before considering whether your action is good or bad
The recommendation is only valid as a reaction against too oppressively moralistic a society it is what the French call a boutade a deliberately paradoxical halftruth but it degenerates into nonsense outside a context of rigid conventionalism
This Gidian itch to flout morality irresponsibly is given its strongest expression in the comic novel Les Caves du Vatican where the dashing young hero Lafcadio a recognizable descendant of Stendhal s Julien Sorel and Dostoyevsky s Raskolnikov lays a wager with himself that he will have the nerve to throw an unsuspecting elderly stranger out of a train window
He wins his bet thus demonstrating the socalled acte gratuit or pure expression of individual freedom
This famous episode anticipated by several years the no less famous sentence in Le Manifeste Surraliste about the essential Surrealist act being The philosophical point is the same in both cases the arbitrary act is in reality an emotional response to the strain of living in the Absurd world where there are no given rules of behavior but only the endless exasperating search for moral compromises
Being emotional the act is in fact neither arbitrary nor gratuitous it is a willfully irrational explosive consequence of a passionate egotistical relationship with the self
From the point of view of traditional humanism it could be called sophisticated imaginative hooliganism harmless enough as long as it remains on the fictional level and even useful as marking the absolute zero of morality
Gide the celebrated reforming humanist may have been incomprehensibly cruel to his wife but he can not actually have been in favor of throwing people out of train windows writing before in the relative security of la belle poque he no doubt saw himself as moving back the frontiers of complacent humanism by means of an amusing credit for doing so
However writing some thirty years later during the horrors of the Second World War Simone Weil who had no sense of humor was perfectly justified in pointing out that the acte gratuit is a pseudophilosophical alibi for every kind of viciousness great and small
Generally speaking then we can say that Gide had the courage to raise moral issues rather than the ability to suggest useful answers
Certainly in the sexual area neither his theories nor his personal conduct were coherently exemplary and this no doubt helps to explain why he has not become an international hero of homosexuality
Not that he ever really aspired to this role in spite of his intermittent proselytizing
He could collapse on occasion into complete skepticism about his moral convictions as is shown by the disarming diary entry
Je ne suis quun petit garcon qui samuse double dun pasteur protestant qui lennuie
I am just a little boy having fun with a final reason for Gide s ambiguous position on the homosexual scene is that none of his literary works is openly homosexual apart from the late novel Les FauxMonnayeurs and even that is only very discreetly so
Les Nourritures terrestes his little pagan bible is full of diffuse eroticism which remains unspecific
At the height of his fame in the twenties and thirties his reputation as a serious novelist rested on three rcits or novellas LImmoraliste La Porte troite and La Symphonie Pastorale which are all written ostensibly from the heterosexual angle
With hindsight all three can now be read as transpositions of his personal sexual problem although this could not be known to his readers at the time of publication
In each book the narrator is a version of Gide himself and Madeleine appears in a different guise in each
All three stories end tragically and in the first two the Madeleine figure dies
I sometimes wonder if he killed off his wife symbolically three if not four times long before she actually died
LImmoraliste follows the events of Gide s early life quite closely
The narrator Michel is a studious young man just beginning on a successful career as a scholar and recently married to a girl he has known since childhood
During their honeymoon in Tunisia he discovers he has tuberculosis and is immobilized in a village hotel where he nearly dies
When he is at a low ebb his wife Marceline happens to bring an Arab boy into his room to distract his attention from his illness
The sight of the healthy young body inspires him with a desire to recover and there follows a long ecstatic period of convalescence during which Michel awakens to the life of the senses so different from his bookish past
Marceline looks after him tenderly but he derives his main stimulus from affectionate but apparently platonic dalliance with Arab complete that upon returning to his country estate in France he can not play the part of the respectable landowner but hobnobs with the lusty peasant lads who poach his own game
Meanwhile he has made Marceline pregnant but she loses the child through a miscarriage which undermines her health
Michel becomes impatient with the restraints of French polite society and longs again for the desert
This time as they move south it is Marceline who becomes tubercular
He is so obsessed with getting away from civilization that he presses on regardless and she unable to bear the strain dies
Michel summons three of his old schoolfriends to the Arab village where he has temporarily settled he tells them his story and asks them if he has behaved badly they surprisingly leave the question open
It must be obvious to any reader that Michel is a monster of selfishness or in the grip of an ungovernable urge
In any case the Nietzschean title
Nevertheless the conclusion of the book is almost comically sanctimonious in its attempt to halfexonerate the hero
Given the dishonesty of the work about the sexual motive it should be a failure but apart from a few overprecious sentences it is so beautifully written and gives such a subtle and rounded picture of the spoiled introspective bourgeois discovering the natural life and being naively transported by it that it has a kind of classic quality
Gide achieves such marvelously precise expression not only of the hero s sensual awakening but also of his selfishness and selfdeception that one can both despise Michel and admire him for delineating himself so completely
One may wish that Gide had gone still further and told the whole truth but the book as it stands is a compromise that works effectively on a certain level although of course it makes no contribution to the homosexual cause
La Porte troite forms a pair with LImmoraliste Gide s quest for selffulfillment whatever the consequences the later appears at first sight to be an extreme elaboration on the theme of Madeleine s recessiveness
The work is still further removed from overt discussion of the sexual question although the title can be given a Freudian interpretation that Gide may or may not have intended
He probably knew nothing about Freud when he wrote the book but he later remarked in his diary that the imbecile of genius had discovered the obvious that he himself had always been aware of
In the story the gate is both a garden gate where the hero and heroine have more than one significant meeting and the strait gate of Luke leading to the virtuous life
Since the theme is the hero s inability to persuade the heroine to renounce her virginity and marry him there is an implied third narrow gate which is particularly difficult of access
The story is another version of the Gide Madeleine relationship
Jrme is childhood whose mother has been unfaithful
This time the heroine is two years older than the hero as was the case in real life
At first they commune in their Christian piety and in their shared enthusiasm for literature and music
When stimulated by the example of a more worldly fellow student Jrme begins to think of marriage and wants to become engaged Alissa puts him off saying at first that she is too old for him and can not be sure that his love will last
She also argues that they are already so intimately bound together by their common love of God that there is no urgency for marriage
From the first it is clear that her attachment to Jrme is in conflict with saintly aspirations
Her next excuse is that she does nt want to get married before her younger sister Juliette
She has in fact discovered that Juliette is in love with Jrme and her motive this time is noble selfsacrifice
When Juliette realizes this de convenance with another suitor and the marriage turns out to be happy
But still Alissa keeps putting Jrme off and with time she gradually turns herself into a sort of lay nun devoted to stultifying good works
In the end she wastes away leaving behind a diary that reveals that she has never resolved the tension between human and divine love
The major weakness of the book which Gide later recognized in a diary entry but without tracing it back to his own sexuality is the passive role played by Jrme
If he had any physical passion for Alissa he would try to overcome her resistance instead of meekly obeying her every whim and allowing her to destroy herself
He is not a man but a sexless blank
Alissa I take to be an extreme development of the negative element that was probably present in Madeleine and at the same time a reflection of Gide s own early mystical fervor and its subsequent withering
However the work is still apparently read in some quarters as a genuinely religious book
I find it too selfconsciously sublime as well as distasteful in its bland avoidance of the sexual roots of the case but it has a certain interest as a study of generalized anorexia nervosa at the opposite pole from the eager appetite for life in LImmoraliste
""
If LImmoraliste was the thesis and La Porte troite the antithesis La Symphonie Pastorale can be seen as the synthesis
At first it may appear quite unconnected with the GideMadeleine issue but this is only because the symbolism is indirect
The narrator is a Swiss pastor in a remote mountain district and he is full of pious expressions of goodwill as he copes with his parish his five children and his rather crotchety wife Amlie
His parsonical tone is not unlike that of the Vicar of Wakefield and we know from Gide s diary that he had read Goldsmith s novel
One day when peasant woman he discovers in her cottage a blind apparently imbecilic girl her niece who is left alone in the world
With Christian charity he brings the girl home much to the displeasure of Amlie who however accepts the situation
They call the girl Gertrude
When the pastor realizes that she is not subnormal but only undeveloped because her deaf old aunt has never been able to communicate with her he embarks with enthusiasm on her education
She blossoms into a pretty sensitive creature whom he instructs in the beauty of life with a passion he has never lavished on his own children
In particular he is careful to shield her from all intimations of evil hence I suppose the relevance of the Beethoven symphony that he takes Gertrude to hear in Neuchtel in this middleperiod Beethoven work evil as represented by the thunderstorm is set between movements celebrating the goodness of God and the beneficence of Nature
Evil breaks into the story however is in love with Gertrude and wants to marry her
He is amazed at his own jealousy and equally taken aback when Gertrude tells him that she has refused Jacques because she is in love with him the pastor and he with her
They seal their love with a kiss and perhaps more
Meanwhile a doctorfriend has suggested that Gertrude s blindness might be cured by an operation
The restoration of her sight brings disaster
She realizes the sorrow she has brought to Amlie and that Jacques not the pastor is the loveobject she saw in her mind s eye
Overwhelmed by the revelation of evil she throws herself into a river and although rescued dies of pneumonia after a last explanation
Jacques disgusted with his father s sentimental laxity enters into holy orders and becomes a Catholic priest
The pastor and Amlie are left sorrowfully reciting the Lord s Prayer together
This novella which can be read at a sitting is of verbal music composed in the most mellifluous and exquisitely modulated French and ironically contradicting the optimism of Beethoven s symphony by the placing of evil at the end instead of in the middle of the pastoral structure
The pastor is clearly a parody of Gide himself with his semipious semipagan enthusiasms his roving spirit and his didactic urge
Amlie is the longsuffering Madeleine an almost silent witness to the vagaries of her husband s temperament
Gertrude can stand for any of the boys with whom Gide became infatuated to his wife s sorrow and whom he helped or harmed by his attentions
If this reading is plausible and I think it is it shows that Gide can not in the last resort be accused of insensitivity or of having only the simplistic attitude to pederasty he sometimes expresses
All the delicate satire of the tale is directed by the Gidefigure against himself the selfdeceiving pastor blinder than the blind girl and who while constantly quoting the New Testament In other words the pastor is after Michel and Jrme a third embodiment of the author s problem and this time he comes to realize that he is in a web of human relationships that has been wrecked by the unconscious egotism with which he has pursued a natural impulse
In addition to being lyrical and humorous the book is genuinely tragic in a way LImmoraliste and La Porte troite are not
It is a nonpartisan work of art which holds the moral issue in balance without resolving it and although homosexuality was no doubt the key issue behind its composition it can be appreciated without any reference to that subject
Here Gide has completely succeeded in transposing the particular into the general which as he I think rightly says is the function of art
With the writing of La Symphonie Pastorale Gide appears to have finally exorcized his problem as a married homosexual unable to separate from his wife or to discuss the problem did not go away but he had sloughed off his worry about it and it ceased to be a source of literary inspiration
If at an early stage he had behaved like another nineteenthcentury homosexual the English art historian John Addington Symonds who after fathering a number of children decided that heterosexuality was not for him and came to an amicable arrangement with his wife French literature would probably have been the poorer by at least three books
Such are the quirks of creativity
But the slackening of the guilty tension did not lead to Gide s emergence as a specifically homosexual novelist
In his last major work of fiction Les FauxMonnayeurs sexual deviance is openly present but surprisingly enough in the muted form of a minor tendency halfvirtuous and halfwicked in a predominantly heterosexual society
The book is a summa encompassing all of Gide s different styles the lyrical the Absurdisthumorous and the analytical and touching religion as a source of good and as a hypocritical alibi the question of realism in art and above all as the title indicates the problem of authentic living
I am not sure that it is a total success but it is his most ambitious creation and a book with great qualities
It consists of a complex interweaving of various different stories involving a score or more of characters and can not be summarized in a few words
Suffice it to say that it again contains a Gidefigure the novelist and compulsive diarist Edouard
It is never openly stated that Edouard is a pederast although unmarried he may have had physical relations with women but as the story begins he is interested in an adolescent Olivier whom he has just got to know and who is the son of his halfsister Pauline
This may reflect the fact that Marc Allgret was related to Gide perhaps incest is relatively unimportant within homosexuality since it return is tremulously enthusiastic about Edouard but misinterpreting the latter s behavior in a fit of pique becomes involved with Comte de Passavant a fashionable superficial man of letters with a homosexual reputation and who is presented in fact as a bad homosexual
According to gossip the model here was Cocteau who had shown an interest in Marc but the character seems very different from Cocteau
Passavant wants to found a new deliberately scandalous literary paper of which Olivier is to be editor although he is just out of school
It is implied that Olivier s appointment like the new wardrobe Passavant has supplied is a reward for services rendered
In the end nothing comes of the project
Olivier gets drunk at the launching party becomes involved in a brawl sees through Passavant s phoniness and appeals for help to Edouard who happens to be present
Edouard carries him off presumably to bed
During the night unhinged Olivier tries to gas himself in the bathroom
He is found in time by Edouard and nursed back to health
Rather reluctantly Pauline accepts the situation because she thinks that Edouard will have a better influence on her son than Passavant
We are not told about the reaction of Olivier s father a prominent magistrate nor do we see any subsequent development of the EdouardOlivier liaison
Although the pederastic idyll is handled with delicate springlike lyricism it is only a very small element in the book and we are even left in doubt about how far it is physical
Besides Olivier is a rather dim figure with no particular quality apart from his beauty which is frequently mentioned and he is outshone by his heterosexual schoolfriend Bernard with whom Edouard has some interesting intellectual discussions and who is an altogether more rounded personality
There is also a hint that Olivier may be only a very temporary sex object soon to be replaced by a younger boy in whom of the book
If this is so Gide is suggesting that the pederastic relationship can never be taken very far by the adult since it depends less on the personal identity of the loved one than on his attraction as a provisional embodiment of youthful charm in short a pederast is probably more in love with youth and beauty than with any particular individual and this is hardly an attitude that lends itself to a crusading development
At no point indeed does Edouard speak out in favor of homosexuality although he argues about many other subjects
Perhaps Gide as he is sometimes inclined to do is deliberately teasing the reader who at this point might have expected a triumphant hymn to homosexuality from so scandalous an author
Or perhaps he had reached a stage when he accepted his deviance with relative serenity as being appropriate for himself but no longer had any strong conviction about it being as morally pure or as universally valid as he once thought
In either must find Les FauxMonnayeurs whatever the book s other virtues of little representational value to the cause

E Pluribus Plures
QUESTIONS OF RACE ETHNICITY AND RELIGION have been a perennial source of conflict in American education
The schools have often attracted the zealous attention of those who wish to influence the future as well as those who wish to change the way we view the past
In our history the schools have been not only an institution in which to teach young people skills and knowledge but an arena where interest groups fight to preserve their values or to revise the judgments of history or to bring about fundamental social change
In the nineteenth century Protestants and Catholics battled over which version of the Bible should be used in school or whether the Bible should be used at all
In recent decades bitter racial disputesprovoked by policies of racial segregation and discriminationhave generated turmoil in the streets and in the schools
The secularization of the schools during the past century has prompted attacks on the curricula and textbooks and library books by fundamentalist Christians who object to whatever science
Given the diversity of American society it has been impossible to insulate the schools from pressures that result from differences and tensions among groups
When people differ about basic values sooner or later those disagreements turn up in battles about how schools are organized or what the schools should teach
sometimes these battles remove a terrible injustice like racial segregation
Sometimes however interest groups politicize the curriculum and attempt to impose their views on teachers school officials and textbook publishers
Across the country even now interest groups are pressuring local school boards to remove myths and fables and other imaginative literature from children s readers and to inject the teaching of creationism in biology
When groups cross the line into extremism advancing their own agenda without regard to reason or to others they threaten public education itself making it difficult to teach any issues honestly and making the entire curriculum vulnerable to political campaigns
For many years the public schools attempted to neutralize controversies over race religion or hoped that the schools could remain outside politics this was of course a vain hope since the schools were pursuing policies based on race religion and ethnicity
Nonetheless such divisive questions were usually excluded from the curriculum
The textbooks minimized problems among groups and taught a sanitized version of history
Race religion and ethnicity were presented as minor elements in the American saga slavery was treated as an episode immigration as a sidebar and women were largely absent
The textbooks concentrated on presidents wars national politics and issues of state
An occasional great black or great woman received mention but the main narrative paid little attention to minority groups and women
With the ethnic revival of the Os this approach to the teaching of history came under fire because the history of national leadersvirtually all of whom were white AngloSaxon and maleignored the place in American history of those who were none of the above
The traditional history American society which presumed that everyone in the American melting pot would eventually lose or abandon those ethnic characteristics that distinguished them from mainstream Americans
The ethnic revival demonstrated that many groups did not want to be assimilated or melted
Ethnic studies programs popped up on campuses to teach not only that black is beautiful but also that every other variety of ethnicity is beautiful as well everyone who had roots began to look for them so that they too could recover that ancestral part of themselves that had not been homogenized
As ethnicity became an accepted subject for study in the late Os textbooks were assailed for their failure to portray blacks accurately within a few years the textbooks in wide use were carefully screened to eliminate bias against minority groups and women
At the same time new scholarship about the history of women blacks and various ethnic minorities found its way into the textbooks
At first the multicultural content was awkwardly incorporated as little boxes on the side social historians like Stephan Thernstrom Mary Beth Norton Gary Nash Winthrop Jordan and Leon Litwack themselves wrote textbooks and the main narrative itself began to reflect a broadened historical understanding of race ethnicity and class in the American past
Consequently today s history textbooks routinely incorporate the experiences of women blacks American Indians and various immigrant groups
Although most high school textbooks are deeply unsatisfactory they still largely neglect religion they are too long too encyclopedic too superficial and lacking in narrative flow they are far more sensitive to pluralism than their predecessors
For example the latest edition of Todd and Curti s Triumph of the American Nation the most popular high school history text has significantly increased its coverage of blacks in America including profiles of Phillis Wheatley the poet James Armistead a revolutionary war spy for Lafayette Benjamin Banneker a selftaught scientist and mathematician Hiram Revels the first black to serve in the Congress lynching and racism
Even better as a textbook treatment is Jordan and Litwack s The United States which skillfully synthesizes the historical experiences of blacks Indians immigrants women and other groups into the mainstream of American social and political history
The latest generation of textbooks bluntly acknowledges the racism of the past describing the struggle for equality by racial minorities while identifying individuals who achieved success as political leaders doctors lawyers scholars entrepreneurs teachers and scientists
As a result of the political and social changes of recent decades cultural pluralism is now generally recognized as an organizing principle of this society
In contrast to the idea of the melting pot which promised to erase ethnic and group differences children now learn that variety is the spice of life
They learn that America has provided a haven for many different groups and has allowed them to maintain their cultural heritage or to assimilate oras is often the caseto do both the choice is theirs not the state s norms of a free society that differences among groups are a national resource rather than a problem to be solved
Indeed the unique feature of the United States is that its common culture has been formed by the interaction of its subsidiary cultures
It is a culture that has been influenced over time by immigrants American Indians Africans slave and free and by their descendants
American music art literature language food clothing sports holidays and customs all show the effects of the commingling of diverse cultures in one nation
Paradoxical though it may seem the United States has a common culture that is multicultural
Our schools and our institutions of higher learning have in recent years begun to embrace what Catherine R Stimpson of Rutgers University has called cultural democracy a recognition that we must listen to a diversity of voices in order to understand our culture past and present
This understanding of the pluralistic nature of American culture has taken a long and has led to major revisions in what children are taught and what they read in school
The new history isindeed must bea wartsandall history it demands an unflinching examination of racism and discrimination in our history
Making these changes is difficult raises tempers and ignites controversies but gives a more interesting and accurate account of American history
Accomplishing these changes is valuable because there is also a useful lesson for the rest of the world in America s relatively successful experience as a pluralistic society
Throughout human history the clash of different cultures races ethnic groups and religions has often been the cause of bitter hatred civil conflict and international war
The ethnic tensions that now are tearing apart Lebanon Sri Lanka Kashmir and various republics of the Soviet Union remind us of the costs of unfettered group rivalry
Thus it is a matter of more than domestic importance that we closely examine and try to understand that part of our national history in which different groups competed together in relative peace and even achieved a sense of common nationhood
Alas these painstaking efforts to expand the understanding of American culture into a richer and more varied tapestry have taken a new turn and not for the better
Almost any idea carried to its extreme can be made pernicious and this is what is happening now to multiculturalism
Today pluralistic multiculturalism must contend with a new particularistic multiculturalism
The pluralists seek a richer common culture the particularists insist that no common culture is possible or desirable
The new particularism is entering the curriculum in a number of school systems across the country
Advocates of particularism propose an ethnocentric curriculum to raise the selfesteem and academic achievement of children from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds
Without any evidence they claim that children from minority backgrounds will do well in school only if they are immersed in a positive prideful version of their ancestral culture
If children are of for example Fredonian ancestry they must hear that Fredonians were
If they learn about great Fredonians and if their studies use Fredonian examples and Fredonian concepts they will do well in school
If they do not they will have low selfesteem and will do badly
At first glance this appears akin to the celebratory activities associated with Black History Month or Women s History Month when schoolchildren learn about the achievements of blacks and women
But the point of those celebrations is to demonstrate that neither race nor gender is an obstacle to high achievement
They teach all children that everyone regardless of their race religion gender ethnicity or family origin can achieve selffulfillment honor and dignity in society if they aim high and work hard
By contrast the particularistic version of multiculturalism is unabashedly filiopietistic and deterministic
It teaches children that their identity is determined by their cultural genes
That something in their blood or their race memory or their cultural DNA defines who they are and what they may achieve
That the culture even though they were born here
That American culture is Eurocentric and therefore hostile to anyone whose ancestors are not European
Perhaps the most invidious implication of particularism is that racial and ethnic minorities are not and should not try to be part of American culture it implies that American culture belongs only to those who are white and European it implies that those who are neither white nor European are alienated from American culture by virtue of their race or ethnicity it implies that the only culture they do belong to or can ever belong to is the culture of their ancestors even if their families have lived in this country for generations
The war on socalled Eurocentrism is intended to foster selfesteem among those who are not of European descent
But how in fact is selfesteem developed How is the sense of one s own possibilities one s potential choices developed Certainly the school curriculum plays a relatively small role as compared to the influence of family community that curriculum influences what children think of themselves it should encourage children of all racial and ethnic groups to believe that they are part of this society and that they should develop their talents and minds to the fullest
It is enormously inspiring for example to learn about men and women from diverse backgrounds who overcame poverty discrimination physical handicaps and other obstacles to achieve success in a variety of fields
Behind every such biography of accomplishment is a story of heroism perseverance and selfdiscipline
Learning these stories will encourage a healthy spirit of pluralism of mutual respect and of selfrespect among children of different backgrounds
The children of American society today will live their lives in a racially and culturally diverse nation and their education should prepare them to do so
The pluralist approach to multiculturalism promotes a broader interpretation of the common American culture and seeks due recognition for the ways that the nation s many racial ethnic and cultural groups have transformed the national culture
The pluralists say all of us the US is us and we remake it in every generation
But particularists have no interest in extending or revising American culture indeed they deny that a common culture exists
Particularists reject any accommodation among groups any interactions that blur the distinct lines between them
The brand of history that they espouse is one in which everyone is either a descendant of victims or oppressors
By doing so ancient hatreds are fanned and recreated in each new generation
Particularism has its intellectual roots in the ideology of ethnic separatism and in the black nationalist movement
In the particularist analysis the nation has five cultures African American Asian American European American LatinoHispanic and Native American
The huge cultural historical religious and linguistic differences within these categories are ignored as is the considerable intermarriage among these groups as are the linkages like gender class sexual orientation and religion that cut across these five groups
No serious scholar would the same culture or that all Asians are part of the same culture or that all people of LatinAmerican descent are of the same culture or that all people of African descent are of the same culture
Any categorization this broad is essentially meaningless and useless
Several districts including Detroit Atlanta and Washington DC are developing an Afrocentric curriculum
Afrocentricity has been described in a book of the same name by Molefi Kete Asante of Temple University
The Afrocentric curriculum puts Africa at the center of the student s universe
African Americans must move away from an sic Eurocentric framework because it is difficult to create freely when you use someone else s motifs styles images and perspectives
Because they are not Africans white teachers can not inspire in our children the visions necessary for them to overcome limitations
Asante recommends that African Americans choose an African name as he did reject European dress embrace African religion not Islam or He scorns the idea of universality as a form of Eurocentric arrogance
The Eurocentrist he says thinks of Beethoven or Bach as classical but the Afrocentrist thinks of Ellington or Coltrane as classical the Eurocentrist lauds Shakespeare or Twain while the Afrocentrist prefers Baraka Shange or Abiola
Asante is critical of black artists like Arthur Mitchell and Alvin Ailey who ignore Afrocentricity
Likewise he speaks contemptuously of a group of black university students who spurned the Afrocentrism of the local Black Student Union and formed an organization called Interrace Such madness is the direct consequence of selfhatred obligatory attitudes false assumptions about society and stupidity
""
The conflict between pluralism and particularism turns on the issue of universalism
Professor Asante warns his readers against the lure of universalism Do not be captured by a sense of universality given to you by the Eurocentric viewpoint such a viewpoint is contradictory to your own ultimate reality
He insists that there is no alternative to Eurocentrism Afrocentrism and with the Roman playwright Terence I am a man nothing human is alien to me
A contemporary Terence would say I am a person or might be a woman but the point remains the same You do nt have to be black to love Zora Neale Hurston s fiction or Langston Hughes s poetry or Duke Ellington s music
In a pluralist curriculum we expect children to learn a broad and humane culture to learn about the ideas and art and animating spirit of many cultures
We expect that children whatever their color will be inspired by the courage of people like Helen Keller Vaclav Havel Harriet Tubman and Feng Lizhe
We expect that their response to literature will be determined by the ideas and images it evokes not by the skin color of the writer
But particularists insist that children can learn only from the experiences of people from the same race
Particularism is a bad idea whose time has come
It is also a fashion by organizations and individuals with a political and professional interest in strengthening ethnic power bases in the university in the education profession and in society itself
One can scarcely pick up an educational journal without learning about a school district that is converting to an ethnocentric curriculum in an attempt to give selfesteem to children from racial minorities
A statefunded project in a Sacramento high school is teaching young black males to think like Africans and to develop the African Mind Model Technique in order to free themselves of the racism of American culture
A popular black rap singer KRSOne complained in an oped article in the New York Times that the schools should be teaching blacks about their cultural heritage instead of trying to make everyone Americans
It s like trying to teach a dog to be a cat he wrote
KRSOne railed about having to learn about Thomas Jefferson and the Civil War which had nothing to do he said with black history
Pluralism can easily the potential uses in the classroom of the Mayan contribution to mathematics
The Mayan example was popularized in a movie called Stand and Deliver about a charismatic Bolivianborn mathematics teacher in Los Angeles who inspired his students who are Hispanic to learn calculus
He told them that their ancestors invented the concept of zero but that was nt all he did
He used imagination to put across mathematical concepts
He required them to do homework and to go to school on Saturdays and during the Christmas holidays so that they might pass the Advanced Placement mathematics examination for college entry
The teacher s reference to the Mayans mathematical genius was a valid instructional device It was an attentiongetter and would have interested even students who were not Hispanic
But the Mayan example would have had little effect without the teacher s insistence that the class study hard for a difficult examination
Ethnic educators have seized upon the Mayan contribution to mathematics as the key to simultaneously boosting the ethnic pride of Hispanic children and attacking Eurocentrism to science and mathematics if they study Mayan mathematics the Mayan calendar and Mayan astronomy
Children in primary grades are to be taught that the Mayans were first to discover the zero and that Europeans learned it long afterwards from the Arabs who had learned it in India
This will help them see that Europeans were latecomers in the discovery of great ideas
Botany is to be learned by study of the agricultural techniques of the Aztecs a subject of somewhat limited relevance to children in urban areas
Furthermore ethnobotanical classifications of plants are to be substituted for the Eurocentric Linnaean system
At first glance it may seem curious that Hispanic children are deemed to have no cultural affinity with Spain but to acknowledge the cultural tie would confuse the ideological assault on Eurocentrism
This proposal suggests some questions Is there any evidence that the teaching of culturally relevant science and mathematics will draw MexicanAmerican children to the study of these subjects Will MexicanAmerican children lose interest or selfesteem if they than Mayans Are children who learn in this way prepared to study the science and mathematics that are taught in American colleges and universities and that are needed for advanced study in these fields Are they even prepared to study the science and mathematics taught in Mexican universities If the class is half MexicanAmerican and half something else will only the MexicanAmerican children study in a Mayan and Aztec mode or will all the children But should nt all children study what is culturally relevant for them How will we train teachers who have command of so many different systems of mathematics and science
The efficacy of particularist proposals seems to be less important to their sponsors than their value as ideological weapons with which to criticize existing disciplines for their alleged Eurocentric bias
In a recent article titled The Ethnocentric Basis of Social Science Knowledge Production in the Review of Research in Education John Stanfield of Yale University argues that neither social science nor science are objective studies that both instead are EuroAmerican knowledge systems that science and reason are somehow superior to magic and witchcraft he writes is the product of EuroAmerican ethnocentrism
According to Stanfield current fears about the misuse of science for instance the nuclear arms race global pollution and the powerplays of Third World nations the Arab oil boycott and the AmericanIranian hostage crisis have made Western people more aware of nonscientific cognitive styles
These last events are beginning to demonstrate politically that which has begun to be understood in intellectual circles namely that modes of social knowledge such as theology science and magic are different not inferior or superior
They represent different ways of perceiving defining and organizing knowledge of life experiences
One wonders If Professor Stanfield broke his leg would he go to a theologian a doctor or a magician
Every field of study it seems has been tainted by Eurocentrism which was defined by a professor at Manchester University George Ghevarughese Joseph in Race Professor Joseph argues that the history of science and technologyand in particular of mathematicsin nonEuropean societies was distorted by racist Europeans who wanted to establish the dominance of European forms of knowledge
The racists he writes traditionally traced mathematics to the Greeks then claimed that it reached its full development in Europe
These are simply Eurocentric myths to sustain an imperialistracist ideology says Professor Joseph since mathematics was found in Egypt Babylonia Mesopotamia and India long before the Greeks were supposed to have developed it
Professor Joseph points out too that Arab scientists should be credited with major discoveries traditionally attributed to William Harvey Isaac Newton Charles Darwin and Sir Francis Bacon
But he is not concerned only to argue historical issues his purpose is to bring all of these different mathematical traditions into the school classroom so that children might study for example traditional African designs Indian rangoli patterns and Islamic art and the language and counting systems found across the world
time when American mathematics educators are trying to overhaul present practices because of the poor performance of American children on national and international assessments
Mathematics educators are attempting to change the teaching of their subject so that children can see its uses in everyday life
There would seem to be an incipient conflict between those who want to introduce reallife applications of mathematics and those who want to teach the mathematical systems used by ancient cultures
I suspect that most mathematics teachers would enjoy doing a bit of both if there were time or student interest
But any widespread movement to replace modern mathematics with ancient ethnic mathematics runs the risk of disaster in a field that is struggling to update existing curricula
If as seems likely ancient mathematics is taught mainly to minority children the gap between them and middleclass white children is apt to grow
It is worth noting that children in Korea who score highest in mathematics on international assessments do not study ancient Korean mathematics
Particularism is akin to cultural Lysenkoism cultural traits are inherited
It implies a dubious dangerous form of cultural predestination
Children are taught that if their ancestors could do it so could they
But what happens if a child is from a cultural group that made no significant contribution to science or mathematics Does this mean that children from that background must find a culturally appropriate field in which to strive How does a teacher find the right cultural buttons for children of mixed heritage And how in the world will teachers use this technique when the children in their classes are drawn from many different cultures as is usually the case By the time that every culture gets its due there may be no time left to teach the subject itself
This explosion of filiopietism which we should remember comes from adults not from students is reminiscent of the period some years ago when the Russians claimed that they had invented everything first as we now know this nationalistic braggadocio did little for their selfesteem and nothing for on how little social prestige has been accorded in this country to immigrants from Greece and Italy even though the achievements of their ancestors were at the heart of the classical curriculum
Filiopietism and ethnic boosterism lead to all sorts of odd practices
In New York State for example the curriculum guide for eleventh grade American history lists three foundations for the United States Constitution as follows PREFORMATTED TABLE
Those who are unfamiliar with the Haudenosaunee political system might wonder what it is particularly since educational authorities in New York State rank it as equal in importance to the European Enlightenment and suggest that it strongly influenced not only colonial leaders but the leading intellectuals of Europe
The Haudenosaunee political system was the Iroquois confederation of five later six Indian tribes in upper New York State which conducted war and civil affairs through a council of chiefs each with one vote
In Benjamin Franklin proposed a colonial union at a conference in Albany his plan said to be inspired colonies
Today Indian activists believe that the Iroquois Confederation was the model for the American Constitution and the New York State Department of Education has decided that they are right
That no other state sees fit to give the American Indians equal billing with the European Enlightenment may be owing to the fact that the Indians in New York State numbering less than forty thousand have been more politically effective than elsewhere or that other states have not yet learned about this method of reducing Eurocentrism in their American history classes
Particularism can easily be carried to extremes
Students of Fredonian descent must hear that their ancestors were seminal in the development of all human civilization and that without the Fredonian contribution we would all be living in caves or trees bereft of art technology and culture
To explain why Fredonians today are in modest circumstances given their historic eminence children are taught that somewhere long ago another culture stole the Fredonians achievements palmed them off as their own encountered this argument almost twenty years ago when I was a graduate student
I shared a small office with a young professor and I listened as she patiently explained to a student why she had given him a D on a term paper
In his paper he argued that the Arabs had stolen mathematics from the Nubians in the desert long ago I forget in which century this theft allegedly occurred
She tried to explain to him about the necessity of historical evidence
He was unconvinced since he believed that he had uncovered a great truth that was beyond proof
The part I could nt understand was how anyone could lose knowledge by sharing it
After all cultures are constantly influencing one another exchanging ideas and art and technology and the exchange usually is enriching not depleting
Today there are a number of books and articles advancing controversial theories about the origins of civilization
An important work The African Origin of Civilization Myth or Reality by Senegalese scholar black civilization that all races are descended from the black race and that the achievements of western civilization originated in Egypt
The views of Diop and other Africanists have been condensed into an everyman s paperback titled What They Never Told You in History Class by Indus khamit Kush
This latter book claims that Moses Jesus Buddha Mohammed and Vishnu were Africans that the first Indians Chinese Hebrews Greeks Romans Britains and Americans were Africans and that the first mathematicians scientists astronomers and physicians were Africans
A debate currently raging among some classicists is whether the Greeks stole the philosophy art and religion of the ancient Egyptians and whether the ancient Egyptians were black Africans
George G M James s Stolen Legacy insists that the Greeks stole the Legacy of the African Continent and called it theIr own
James argues that the civilization of Greece the vaunted foundation of European culture owed everything it knew and did to its African not in Greece and Rome but in Egypt and ultimately in black Africa
Similar speculation was fueled by the publication in of Martin Bernal s Black Athena The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization Volume The Fabrication of Ancient Greece although the controversy predates Bernal s book
In a fascinating foray into the politics of knowledge Bernal attributes the preference of Western European scholars for Greece over Egypt as the fount of knowledge to nearly two centuries of racism and Europocentrism but he is uncertain about the color of the ancient Egyptians
However a review of Bernal s book last year in the Village Voice began What color were the ancient Egyptians Blacker than Mubarak baby
The same article claimed that white racist archeologists chiseled the noses off ancient Egyptian statues so that future generations would not see the typically African facial characteristics
The debate reached the pages of the Biblical Archeology Review last year in an article titled Were the Ancient Egyptians Black Yurco argues that some Egyptian rulers were black others were not and that the ancient Egyptians did not think in these terms
The issue wrote Yurco is a chimera cultural baggage from our own society that can only be imposed artificially on ancient Egyptian society
""
Most educationists are not even aware of the debate about whether the ancient Egyptians were black or white but they are very sensitive to charges that the schools curricula are Eurocentric and they are eager to rid the schools of the taint of Eurocentrism
It is hardly surprising that America s schools would recognize strong cultural ties with Europe since our nation s political religious educational and economic institutions were created chiefly by people of European descent our government was shaped by European ideas and nearly percent of the people who live here are of European descent
The particularists treat all of this history as a racist bias toward Europe rather than as the matteroffact consequences of European immigration
Even American education if it is centered on anything is centered on itself
It is Americentric
Most American students today have never studied any world history they know very little about Europe and even less about the rest of the world
Their minds are rooted solidly in the here and now
When the Berlin Wall was opened in the fall of journalists discovered that most American teenagers had no idea what it was nor why its opening was Such a big deal
Nonetheless Eurocentrism provides a better target than Americentrism
In school districts where most children are black and Hispanic there has been a growing tendency to embrace particularism rather than pluralism
Many of the children in these districts perform poorly in academic classes and leave school without graduating
They would fare better in school if they had welleducated and wellpaid teachers small classes good materials encouragement at home and school summer academic programs protection from the drugs and crime that ravage their neighborhoods and higher and timeconsuming remedies that must also engage the larger society beyond the school
The lure of particularism is that it offers a less complicated anodyne one in which the children s academic deficiencies may be addressedor set asideby inflating their racial pride
The danger of this remedy is that it will detract attention from the real needs of schools and the real interests of children while simultaneously arousing distorted race pride in children of all races increasing racial antagonism and producing fresh recruits for white and black racist groups
The particularist critique gained a major forum in New York in with the release of a report called A Curriculum of Inclusion produced by a task force created by the State Commissioner of Education Thomas Sobol
In soon after his appointment Sobol appointed a Task Force on Minorities to review the state s curriculum for instances of bias
He did this not because there had been complaints about bias in the curriculum but becauseas a newly appointed state commissioner whose previous job had Scarsdalehe wanted to demonstrate his sensitivity to minority concerns
The Sobol task force was composed of representatives of African American Hispanic Asian American and American Indian groups
The task force engaged four consultants one from each of the aforementioned racial or ethnic minorities to review nearly one hundred teachers guides prepared by the state
These guides define the state s curriculum usually as a list of facts and concepts to be taught along with model activities
The primary focus of the consultants not surprisingly was the history and social studies curriculum
As it happened the history curriculum had been extensively revised in to make it multicultural in both American and world history
In the revision the time given to Western Europe was reduced to onequarter of one year as part of a twoyear global studies sequence in which equal time was allotted to seven major world regions including Africa and Latin America
As a result of the revisions in American and world history historysocial studies curricula in the country
Dozens of social studies teachers and consultants had participated and the final draft was reviewed by such historians as Eric Foner of Columbia University the late Hazel Hertzberg of Teachers College Columbia University and Christopher Lasch of the University of Rochester
The curriculum was overloaded with facts almost to the point of numbing students with details and trivia but it was not insensitive to ethnicity in American history or unduly devoted to European history
But the Sobol task force decided that this curriculum was biased and Eurocentric
The first sentence of the task force report summarizes its major thesis African Americans Asian Americans Puerto Ricans Latinos and Native Americans have all been the victims of an intellectual and educational oppression that has characterized the culture and institutions of the United States and the European American world for centuries
The task force report was remarkable in that it vigorously denounced bias without identifying a single instance of bias in the curricular guides under review
Instead the every difference of opinion or interpretation as an example of racial bias
The AfricanAmerican consultant for example excoriates the curriculum for its White AngloSaxon WASP value system and norms its deepseated pathologies of racial hatred and its white nationalism he decries as bias the fact that children study Egypt as part of the Middle East instead of as part of Africa
Perhaps Egypt should be studied as part of the African unit geographically it is located on the African continent but placing it in one region rather than the other is not what most people think of as racism or bias
The Latino consultant criticizes the use of the term SpanishAmerican War instead of SpanishCubanAmerican War
The Native American consultant complains that tribal languages are classified as foreign languages
""
The report is consistently Europhobic
It repeatedly expresses negative judgments on European Americans and on everything Western and European
All people with a white skin are referred to says the report is uniquely responsible for producing aggressive individuals who were ready to discover invade and conquer foreign land because of greed racism and national egoism
All white people are held collectively guilty for the historical crimes of slavery and racism
There is no mention of the AngloSaxons who opposed slavery and racism
Nor does the report acknowledge that some whites have been victims of discrimination and oppression
The African American consultant writes of the Constitution There is something vulgar and revolting in glorifying a process that heaped undeserved rewards on a segment of the population while oppressing the majority

The New York task force proposal is not merely about the reconstruction of what is taught
It goes a step further to suggest that the history curriculum may be used to ensure that children from Native American Puerto RicanLatino Asian American and African American cultures will have higher selfesteem and selfrespect while children from European cultures will have a less arrogant perspective of being part of
In February Commissioner Sobol asked the New York Board of Regents to endorse a sweeping revision of the history curriculum to make it more multicultural
His recommendations were couched in measured tones not in the angry rhetoric of his task force
The board supported his request unanimously
It remains to be seen whether New York pursues the particularist path marked out by the Commissioner s advisory group or finds its way to the concept of pluralism within a democratic tradition
The rising tide of particularism encourages the politicization of all curricula in the schools
If education bureaucrats bend to the political and ideological winds as is their wont we can anticipate a generation of struggle over the content of the curriculum in mathematics science literature and history
Demands for culturally relevant studies for ethnostudies of all kinds will open the classroom to unending battles over whose version is taught who gets credit for what and which ethnointerpretation is appropriate
Only recently have districts begun to resist the demands and some have not yet begun to do so
The spread of particularism throws into question the very idea of American public education
Public schools exist to teach children the general skills and knowledge that they need to succeed in American society and the specific skills and knowledge that they need in order to function as American citizens
They receive public support because they have a public function
Historically the public schools were known as common schools because they were schools for all even if the children of all the people did not attend them
Over the years the courts have found that it was unconstitutional to teach religion in the common schools or to separate children on the basis of their race in the common schools
In their curriculum their hiring practices and their general philosophy the public schools must not discriminate against or give preference to any racial or ethnic group
Yet they are permitted to accommodate cultural diversity by for example serving food that is culturally appropriate or community
However they should not be expected to teach children to view the world through an ethnocentric perspective that rejects or ignores the common culture
For generations those groups that wanted to inculcate their religion or their ethnic heritage have instituted private schoolsafter school on weekends or on a fulltime basis
There children learn with others of the same groupGreeks Poles Germans Japanese Chinese Jews Lutherans Catholics and so onand are taught by people from the same group
Valuable as this exclusive experience has been for those who choose it this has not been the role of public education
One of the primary purposes of public education has been to create a national community a definition of citizenship and culture that is both expansive and inclusive
The curriculum in public schools must be based on whatever knowledge and practices have been determined to be best by TOOLONG teachers and scholarswho are competent to make these judgments
Professional societies must be prepared to defend the integrity of their disciplines to examine disputes over curriculum and to render judgment in order to help school officials fend off improper political pressure
Where genuine controversies exist they should be taught and debated in the classroom
Was Egypt a black civilization Why not raise the question read the arguments of the different sides in the debate show slides of Egyptian pharoahs and queens read books about life in ancient Egypt invite guest scholars from the local university and visit museums with Egyptian collections If scholars disagree students should know it
One great advantage of this approach is that students will see that history is a lively study that textbooks are fallible that historians disagree that the writing of history is influenced by the historian s politics and ideology that history is written by people who make choices among alternative facts and interpretations and that history changes as new facts are uncovered and new interpretations win adherents
They will also learn that cultures and civilizations constantly interact exchange ideas and influence one another a myth
Another advantage is that students might once again study ancient history which has all but disappeared from the curricula of American schools
California recently introduced a required sixth grade course in ancient civilizations but ancient history is otherwise terra incognita in American education
""
The multicultural controversy may do wonders for the study of history which has been neglected for years in American schools
At this time only half of our high school graduates ever study any world history
Any serious attempt to broaden students knowledge of Africa Europe Asia and Latin America will require at least two and possibly three years of world history a requirement thus far only in California
American history too will need more time than the oneyear highschool survey course
Those of us who have insisted for years on the importance of history in the curriculum may not be ready to assent to its redemptive power but hope that our new allies will ultimately join a constructive dialogue that strengthens the controversies arise educators must adhere to the principle of E Pluribus Unum
That is they must maintain a balance between the demands of the onethe nation of which we are common citizensand the manythe varied histories of the American people
It is not necessary to denigrate either the one or the many
Pluralism is a positive value but it is also important that we preserve a sense of an American communitya society and a culture to which we all belong
If there is no overall community with an agreedupon vision of liberty and justice if all we have is a collection of racial and ethnic cultures lacking any common bonds then we have no means to mobilize public opinion on behalf of people who are not members of our particular group
We have for example no reason to support public education
If there is no larger community then each group will want to teach its own children in its own way and public education ceases to exist
History should not be pride
No race has a monopoly on virtue
If anything a study of history should inspire humility rather than pride
People of every racial group have committed terrible crimes often against others of the same group
Whether one looks at the history of Europe or Africa or Latin America or Asia every continent offers examples of inhumanity
Slavery has existed in civilizations around the world for centuries
Examples of genocide can be found around the world throughout history from ancient times right through to our own day
Governments and cultures sometimes by edict sometimes simply following tradition have practiced not only slavery but human sacrifice infanticide cliterodectomy and mass murder
If we teach children this they might recognize how absurd both racial hatred and racial chauvinism are
What must be preserved in the study of history is the spirit of inquiry the readiness to open new questions and to pursue new understandings
History at its best is a search for truth
The controversy rather than through imposition of fixed beliefs and immutable facts
Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of school history is its tendency to become Official History a sanctified version of the Truth taught by the state to captive audiences and embedded in beautiful massmarket textbooks as holy writ
When Official History is written by committees responding to political pressures rather than by scholars synthesizing the best available research then the errors of the past are replaced by the politically fashionable errors of the present
It may be difficult to teach children that history is both important and uncertain and that even the best historians never have all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle but it is necessary to do so
If state education departments permit the revision of their history courses and textbooks to become an exercise in power politics then the entire process of statelevel curriculummaking becomes suspect as does public education itself
The question of selfesteem is extraordinarily complex and it goes well beyond the content of the curriculum
Most of what we variety of life experiences not only in school
Nonetheless it has been important for blacksand for other racial groupsto learn about the history of slavery and of the civil rights movement it has been important for blacks to know that their ancestors actively resisted enslavement and actively pursued equality and it has been important for blacks and others to learn about black men and women who fought courageously against racism and who provide models of courage persistence and intellect
These are instances where the content of the curriculum reflects sound scholarship and at the same time probably lessens racial prejudice and provides inspiration for those who are descendants of slaves
But knowing about the travails and triumphs of one s forebears does not necessarily translate into either selfesteem or personal accomplishment
For most children selfesteemthe selfconfidence that grows out of having reached a goalcomes not from hearing about the monuments of their ancestors but as a consequence of what they are able to do and accomplish through their own efforts
As I reflected on these issues a talented black runner
She said that her model is Mikhail Baryshnikov
She admires him because he is a magnificent athlete
He is not black he is not female he is not Americanborn he is not even a runner
But he inspires her because of the way he trained and used his body
When I read this I thought how narrowminded it is to believe that people can be inspired only by those who are exactly like them in race and ethnicity

LIKE MANY PEOPLE NOW IN THEIR THIRTIES I grew up in the long shadow cast by the Second World War
A green wool uniform hung in our cedar closet and accounts of the Pacific island campaigns were part of the casual family conversations during Saturday errands or cleanings of the garage
At an early age I knew my father had served with the marines that the fighting had taken place on remote Pacific islands and that the destruction of Hiroshima had saved American forces from a deadly assault on the Japanese mainland
Legends or so they seemed were woven around distant places like the Solomon Islands Espiritu Santo and New Britain
In other families similar stories must have been told about the Normandy beaches Cassino and night flights over Ploesti
These war stories were vivid scenes in the tableau that explained not just something about my father but what it was to fight in a war
In the early s television made it easy to imagine the track small units on their way to either Berlin or Tokyo
German and Japanese soldiers died by the hundreds in a manner that portrayed war as no more difficult than a cattle roundup or in the case of snipers a fox hunt
By that time John Wayne was devoting less effort to the defeat of the Japanese
But other actors such as Cliff Robertson in PT portrayed the Pacific campaigns as updated versions of chivalrous guests
Armies were never depicted as faceless industrial machines or as capable of such blunders as Tarawa or Peleliu
Instead they were squads or torpedo boats like that skippered by Lt John Kennedy which inevitably survived tough scapes behind enemy lines
No wonder Vietnam proved such a disappointment
Did nt the North Vietnamese realize their role in the epic of Americans at arms
Although I warmed to Hollywood s romance of the war won with errant knights I noticed my father gave it a cool reception
As I now recollect he never took me to humor for movielot combat
But he did talk freely about the war
And from our conversations about what it was like to survive an air raid or lead an assault I inferred that the best way to fathom war was to read about it
Even my father s answers to my boyish questions about bombs and bullets contained allusions to literature
Before I was able to finish fulllength books I knew that the key to understanding jungle warfare lay in The Thin Red Line by James Jones or that Erich M Remarque s All Quiet on the Western Front applied to trenches on Okinawa as well as to those in France
The memoirs of generals were written by publicists and were probably unreliable
The only way to understand what had happened was to hear it from someone who was there
Truth it seemed could be picked up from a radiant that grew weaker the farther you got from the front lines
Just as our conversations of war touched on its literature so there on DDay and led a rifle company through four months of the campaign which included a bayonet charge on the banks of the Tenaru River
But he refused either to romanticize the fighting or to wallow in selfpity for having been sent there
If anything his narratives were and still are laced with ironic detachment as if survivalthen and nowrequired a separation from the brutality of the warfare or the misery of the conditions
Because Guadalcanal in our family acquired the position of a mythological site it never occurred to me that I might go there
Not only was it a dark land of giants but it lay in the South Pacific among the farflung archipelago that stretched from Honolulu to Australia
I never included it even in my travel daydreams until I was given William Manchester s Goodbye Darkness
The inscription from my father read Someday you will travel among these islands and form your own memories of the distant battle sites
""
I found the Manchester in the autobiographies of Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves
But Manchester was remembering not the trenches along the Somme but the island warfare that had loomed so large in my childhood imagination
He also retraced the steps taken by the marines on their way from New Guinea to Okinawa
Until Manchester proved otherwise I had thought Gog and Magog more accessible than Guadalcanal Cape Gloucester or the Palaus
But with relative ease he had flown to Honiara the capital of Guadalcanal and hiked across the battlefield as if he were visiting Bull Run or Spotsylvania
His writing mixed a travel account with a wartime memoir and a history of the Pacific campaign such that it takes a careful reader to figure out that Manchester was nt the only marine to have seen action in all the campaigns
But I chose to overlook such narrative liberties
Manchester had given me confidence that someday I might travel among these islands
""
My chance to visit Guadalcanal came after a business trip to Australia that ended with Port Moresby is seven hundred miles east of Guadalcanal although the flights between them tend to be on islandhoppers
I finished my work late on a Tuesday
The next morning instead of starting the slow trip home to New York I put in a AM wakeup call in time to catch a AM flight to Guadalcanal
The only taxi in front of the Port Moresby Travelodge needed a rollstart for the engine to engage
In the predawn blackness the driver coaxed his Holden sedan around hairpin coastal turns and through yellow lights
Port Moresby has little to recommend it especially in the middle of the night
Downtown is a disjointed mix of highrise apartments suburban office blocks and openfront stores that attract midday idlers
Like Juneau Alaska it is a landlocked capital surrounded by jagged forbidding mountains
The landscape is dry and dusty and the one beach in town is avoided because crime is endemic
The inner harbor with some rusting hulks and a The plot would involve the alcoholism of a diplomat s wife who would be unable to escape the confines of the club let alone the city or the country
I had some doubts about leaving myself as the driver nursed the engine at lonely streetlights
But we made the airport with time to spare
Air Niugini flight number climbed to cruising altitude above the Owen Stanley Range where lowlevel clouds whisked among labyrinthine valleys
Among those ridges at the start of the Second World War Australian troops had defeated the Japanese in bitter jungle fighting along the Kokoda Trail
The day before in Moresby I had driven to the Bomana War Cemetery that lies in the foothills of the Owen Stanleys
The cemetery was the familiar symmetrical pattern of white headstones set against neatly tended grass
All had engraved poetic inscriptions or simple family farewells suggesting an orderly end
But the hills in the distance where most of the men had died in the handtohand fighting had the look of a tropical Bougainville down The Slot to Guadalcanal
On either side of the plane were small clusters of tropical islands whose names form a roster of Second World War battles Vella Lavella New Georgia the Russells Savo Island and Tulagi
At its simplest the campaign in the Solomons was to control this turquoise corridor that came to represent the left flank of the Japanese march to New Zealand and Australia
Nowhere in the world did the US suffer the naval defeats that it sustained off Guadalcanal in waters that came to be known as Iron Bottom Sound
Eventually American firepower exhausted the enemy
But with a few twists of fate the Japanese fleets in The Slot could easily have crossed the T on the idea of the American century
Guadalcanal is one of those places at least in literature that rarely makes a good impression
Jack London who sailed there on the ketch Snark wrote If I were a king the worst punishment I could inflict upon my enemies would Manchester remembers his first emotions as mixed I thought of Baudelaire fleurs du mal
It was a vision of beauty but of evil In between were thick steamy matted almost impenetrable screens of cassia liana vines and twisted creepers masked here and there by mangrove swamps and clumps of bamboo The forest seemed almost faunal arrogant malevolent cruel
My father described his first impression in an account of the battle that was published in American Heritage At first light we stood along the rail and looked out across the calm violet water
There lay the island dark and impassively sinister shrouded in an early morning haze pinpricked by bright orange flashes of shell fire from our ships
""
For me Guadalcanal appeared as rocky jungle whose inhospitable mountaintops were encased in clouds
We made landfall over Cape Esperance the northwestern tip of the island and flew parallel to the coastal road
From a map in a history I was reading Point and the mouth of the Iluplaces of battle that I previously imagined as remote in many ways as Cold Harbor Ypres or Kasserine Pass
I was also struck by the island s colors the warmth of an azure sea against a stark green jungle
In my mind Guadalcanal was a blackandwhite photograph that showed men coming ashore or hiking jungle trails
The sea and the underbrush were always gray
I cleared customs at Henderson International Airport a name that tickles my father who knew it only as Henderson Field a muddy landing strip that was the prize of battle
In the waiting room was a brass plaque that listed the winners at Guadalcanal of the Congressional Medal of Honor
Names such as Archer Vandergrift who was the commanding general or Merritt Edson a battalion commander I knew well from my reading but to the other passengers who filed out carrying scuba gear and tennis rackets this might have been an intersection in a New England town and about deeds accomplished at the Wilderness
On the bus ride into town I was seated next to an American I judged to be in his early seventies
He wore khakis a sun hat and betrayed none of the hesitance of a firsttime visitor
He had been on Guadalcanal during the war although after the fighting and pointed out such landmarks as the original control tower at Henderson Field Kukum airstrip and the Lunga River which you cross on the twentyminute ride into Honiara
To see the battlefields he said I would need both a car and a driver
To get around he added I should buy some topographical maps from the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands which was a short walk from the hotel
Honiara looks like one of those Caribbean towns that travel guides recommend for a halfday s shopping
It has schools a few oil tanks government buildings lots of little boys riding in the back of pickup trucks and the Mendana Hotel
The local businessmen with briefcases at their ankles and American veterans on trips of remembrance
Many of the Americans wore Hawaiian shirts gim me caps and name tags that bore the insignia of their travel brigades
I found it difficult to recognize these men as the dashing soldiers of my childhood imagination as I am sure it is hard for many of them to fit together their lives then and now
Chatting with some of them in the lobby and at the bar made me remember meeting a World War I veteran in a Yugoslavian village in 
He spoke no English but we were trying to understand each other when he abruptly left the conversation only to return moments later carrying a large framed picture
It showed the same man in his early twenties with dark hair a thin moustache and military trim
You see his melancholic expression conveyed I have nt always been what you re seeing today
""
After lunch I bought the maps was Paul
I wondered why I needed a driver at all until we crossed the Lunga River and plunged into a coconut plantation on small dirt trails
I have always thought of Guadalcanal as Gettysburg in the Pacifican improbable place for the collision of two industrial armies
At Gettysburg today it is hard to see the battlefields for the monuments
But Guadalcanal as my friend on the bus had pointed out is unmarked
I had my topographical surveys a military history a guide and a rented car and still it was difficult to navigate through the Lever Brothers plantation which was the original perimeter
The island does nt have a visitors center driving tours battlefield signs or gift shops
Hence unlike the geometric symmetry of Civil War history as presented by the Department of the Interior what remains vivid at Guadalcanal even at midday is the fog of war
On one of these cart trails near Henderson Field we came across another car full of Americans man about my age said that his father was out in the thicket looking for his foxhole
Before long the father emerged breathless to declare that he had found the foxhole where he had lived for the worst six months of the Campaign
I asked a few questions about the island then and now but instead of an answer what I got was a monologue
The father recounted landing on the island his part in the campaign how he survived the importance of air power the sweep of the Pacific campaign and on and on
Great interest on my part turned to tedium until after twenty minutes I walked back to my car
Paul the driver was more polite and got another five minutes on what General MacArthur had been up to in New Guinea
I am sure the father had spent a conventional life and functioned normally
But either the heat or his return to Guadalcanal had moved the plates along some dormant emotional fault line
I regretted my phrase when he would talk of the war s effect and how for some it had scrambled their brains
We threaded our way through the coconut plantation to Henderson Field now a long asphalt runway and then drove east to Red Beach where the marines and among them my father first landed
The popular image of amphibious landings in the Pacific has marines hitting beaches edged with thick jungle
Fortyeight years ago that might have been Red Beach but now it is a thin strip of sand that gives way to scrubby grass the occasional palm tree and a saw mill
I had expected a marker a few plaques maybe a map with arrows showing what had happened which is typical of the American battlefields in Europe but instead we parked near a rubbish heap and walked to the beach through the yard of a seaside house
To reconstruct events meant spreading the topographical maps in the sand and digging through the books and articles I had jammed into a s steps because he has written two accounts of the battle
Immediately after the campaign probably in January of he wrote his company s report
It was forgotten until the summer of when one of his men sent him a copy with a note I was cleaning out an old foot locker recently and ran across the enclosed documents Thank you for the good example you set for this year old country boy from Alabama
Before my trip my father handed me a copy but added a critique of his own literary style
This is written he said as if to place the writing along the spectrum of Guadalcanal prose in that dry military style
It has all the usual battlefield cliche s about achieving objectives and engaging the enemy
But I know it pleased him that the report had resurfaced
I also had my father s article from American Heritage which he wrote in the summer of at the prompting of who had heard his account of the battle and urged him to set it down on paper
The narrator of the company report is a young first lieutenant who records the action in a style now preferred in corporate memos
For example he describes the landing We penetrated from the beach to a distance of yards inland and crossed a tributary of the Ilu without opposition Darkness found the company deep in the jungle at the headwaters of the At firing broke out on the left flank which was answered ineffectively
Pfc Oscar Grover was killed
""
The writer in American Heritage by contrast speaks in the voice I know to be my father s and the detachment of forty years gives the narrative what Paul Fussell has described as the irony of war
Guadalcanal is not sixty minutes of wellplayed football but an unending series of long days journeys that are followed by terrifying nights
The landing and the move inland are not previews of John Wayne at war that are confusing illogical random and fatal
No orders came until just before nightfall when we were told to move on again
We followed the company to our right leaving the high grass and pushing through the jungle single file
Darkness came swiftly and I thought this was an extraordinary way to be going anywhere toward a possible enemy position in the dead of night
When the command came to halt the men flopped down on either side of the trail
Shortly thereafter as we lay together in the blackness came our first experience of pure terror
Without warning a cacophony of small arms fire enveloped us
A Japanese ambush But the shots were coming at pointblank range
Too close We were firing at each other
I do nt know how I made my voice heard above the din but the platoon leaders and noncoms took up the cry Cease fire
Shaken and exhausted we lay silent until the dawn installment of the price we were to pay
From Red Beach where I was standing it took my father s company two days to advance through the jungle and seize the airstrip
Then the company took a position on the perimeter about a mile inland and prepared for the Japanese counterattack
His company report indicates Outposts were manned on along the east end of the air field
But writing forty years later he remembers There were gaps of hundreds of yards between the fortified positions of our units
The only thing that enabled us to survive the battles that were to come was the incredible luck that inspired the Japanese always to attack at those points where we were dug in instead of the vast empty spaces where we were not
""
Back in the car Paul and I wandered among some of these empty spaces looking for the site of the Battle of Tenaru
It actually occurred on a spit of the Ilu a nearby river but confusion continues fifty years later
Paul knew Red Beach and Henderson Field but not the Battle of the Tenaru
Nor did his knowledge of jungle streams match that of the topographical maps
Again I was angered that our Pentagon dollars had never included signs to remember a pivotal battle in the Pacific
Belleau Wood along the Marne is decorated with monuments and maps of the World War I marine victory but part of Red Beach is a junkyard and the only way to find the Ilu spit is with topographical surveys
I was eager to find it because that is where Americans first defeated Japanese infantry and where my father led a bayonet charge into enemy lines
Many times I had heard the story of how the Japanese had sent the Ichiki Battalion along the beach to attack and they thought destroy the US defensive positions around the airfield
Instead it was unable to ford the socalled Tenaru and was enveloped by a battalion that included my father s company
Of the bayonet charge he later swirling gunsmoke lunging stabbing and smashing with bayonets and rifle butts
In the battle the entire Japanese battalion about nine hundred men died
A famous Second World War photograph of the Tenaru shows rows of dead Japanese soldiers pressed into the sand as if they have washed ashore in a deadly tide
It echoes A Harvest of Death Timothy OSullivan s photograph of Union dead in a misty Gettysburg field
After a long walk through dense shoreline bush I finally stood at the mouth of the Tenaru and recalled the disturbing end to this familiar story
After the fighting had ceased a Japanese soldier playing dead threw a hand grenade at several American soldiers including my father who later wrote Miraculously we were unhurt by the blast we rushed at him and as dErrico covered him with his rifle I placed my automatic pistol to his head and pulled the trigger
""
Although such action was the ingredient of the movies to visit a place where my father had killed a man
Casualties in war are easier to fathom when they come in broad engagements and end up in body counts
To contribute to my unease whenever my father tells this story he adds that he went through the man s wallet and found a snapshot of his wife and two children smiling before a lacquered screen
Even when I was young such a postscript changed the account from a gung ho war story to one that saw in every one of the war dead a distant family
For my father the wallet picture may have been the only time on Guadalcanal that he saw the Japanese as something other than a hated foe capable of every treachery
As he later wrote Hacking our way through the jungle we tended to think of the enemy as wily Orientals at home in this nightmarish terrain
We forgot that they were young men from crowded cities like Tokyo and farmland like Kyushu just as we were city boys Both my father s company report and the magazine article are remarkable for the way they describe death in individual terms
The fighting on Guadalcanal lasted six months
Thirty thousand men on both sides were killed
Under such conditions I would expect a battlefield report to describe casualties just as Nathaniel Hawthorne had described the death of the stranger in The Ambitious Guest His name and person utterly unknown his history his way of life his plans a mystery never to be solved
Instead each death or wounding is treated with an empathy I never imagined to be part of troop movements in the Second World War
As a result the report reads like a log from a beleaguered clipper ship or Daniel DeFoe s Journal from a Plague Year
At a low level bombing attack was sustained in which Private Dan R Hunt was killed and Private Andrew J Thomason wounded Subsequently dysentery heavily affected the health of the Company
Private Thomas J Knichel died of the disease August shrapnel
In the ensuing fire fight Private John C Green was killed
The idea of war as the sum of specific deaths was also a recurring theme among the early war stories that I can remember
It formed the antidote to my favorable impression of war as a variation on professional football
In particular the death that seared my conscience was that of Bob Fowler who served as lieutenant with my father on Guadalcanal
Millions died in the Second World War but his death was the only one that seemed like the loss of a family member
By the age of seven I knew that my father s closest friend Bob Fowler had died as it was put on the last day of the war
I remember wondering in a childish way why he had not known the war was about to end and laid low
His picture in the family album shows a boyish man in his early twenties with sharp exuberant features and a British documentary on East Africa
My father always referred to him by his nickname Swifty which added to the legend
In the report Bob Fowler often gets singled out for special mention as if he were a favorite son or brother The enemy was compelled to retire upon receiving fire from the light machine guns in the weapons platoon commanded by Lt Fowler
After capturing Mahile Lt Fowler was ordered to move east and investigate a small native mission
Lt Fowler made a three day combat patrol to wipe out an enemy field piece which had been registering in the sector
He personally accounted for a Japanese officer
But the Bob Fowler described often to my sisters and me was not a ferocious warrior or grizzled marine so much as a cheerful warmhearted friend who somehow had the ability to endure the horrors of war and maintain a genial disposition
Although I knew Bob Fowler had died mythically on the last day of the war to my knowledge
Bob Fowler had left the First Marines after the campaign on New Britain returned to the United States to take command of his own company and died while fighting on Okinawa
More than once I heard my father say I always felt that if he had stayed with me I could have gotten him through
Anyone who comes home from any war returns with many regrets and for my father they focused on the death of Bob Fowler
It was as if the war had a purpose and meaning until that point after which all the fighting became a variation on the senselessness that destroyed the Warsaw ghetto
The story ended there until I discovered in Goodbye Darkness that the company Bob Fowler had commanded was William Manchester s
And in Manchester s book is an account of how Fowler died
Manchester includes it in a passage that elaborates on James Jones s belief of how easy it is in war to slip over the thin red line father had warned me that war is grisly beyond imagining
Now I believed him
Bob Fowler F Company s popular towheaded commander had bled to death after being hit in the spleen
His orderly who adored him snatched up a submachine gun and unforgivably massacred a line of unarmed Japanese soldiers who had just surrendered
I actually read the passage to my father strangely enough at a Memorial Day family barbecue
He was eager to hear what had happened and I simply started reading aloud
When I finished the passage he flushed red and swore sharply and uncharacteristically in front of the group God damn it to hell while stinging the seat cushion with his palm
Obviously he had never heard the story and it was painful to think of his friend bleeding to death helplessly
Nor did he want to hear that Bob Fowler s death had been the cause of an atrocity
The cry was a brief scream of reason that recoiled at so many the Italian campaign Ernie Pyle wrote a celebrated newspaper column about the death of another company commander Henry Waskow
In Wartime Paul Fussell uses that column to deflate Pyle as a sentimental propagandist who never let too many facts of war get in the way of his messages to the American heartland
But that column described to me the numbing agony of what it was like to lose a friend in the war
It could just as easily I sensed have been written about the death of Bob Fowler
E B Sledge a memoirist Fussell much admires wrote similarly about the death of his marine captain Our company commander represented stability and direction in a world of violence death and destruction
Now his life had been snuffed out
We felt forlorn and lost
It was the worst grief I endured during the entire war
The intervening years have nt lessened it any
Or as Pyle quotes one of the soldiers passing the corpse of Captain Waskow My driver Paul and I left the mouth of the Ilu and drove south of Henderson Field to see Edson s Bloody Ridge and the terrain of the upper Lunga River
From this savage noman s land the Japanese had launched repeated attacks against the airstrip
Edson s Ridge a whaleshaped hillcrest was another of the fortified positions that the Japanese were unlucky to strike
Even though a few of the enemy broke through to the airfield most were killed or turned away in handtohand night combat that my father remembers as a distant flarelit rumble in which to his great relief his company was spared any action
Edson s Ridge overlooks the airfield and the expanse of Iron Bottom Sound
If Guadalcanal was Gettysburg in the Pacific this was Little Round Top
It is capped with one of the few historical markers on the island a white obelisk as modest as the rock in the Pennsylvania woods that remembers the th Maine
But the rest of Guadalcanal that we saw except for the at least historically
The only way to imagine what happened even with a guide was to evoke the books written about the island
It turned a trip to a battlefield into one of those walking tours that visits the houses of great writers
Guadalcanal has inspired a small library of fiction and nonfiction much of which lined the shelves where I grew up
In early almost before the fighting had ended Guadalcanal Diary by Richard Tregaskis and Into the Valley by John Hersey were published helping to fuel the legend that was growing
Samuel Eliot Morison devoted a volume to the importance of its sea battles in his naval history of the war
James Jones used Guadalcanal as the setting for The Thin Red Line although he created a fictional landscape
As he wrote in the foreword To have used a completely made up island would have been to lose all of these special qualities which the name Guadalcanal evoked for my generation
""
I
He writes about a rifle companyeven a C Companyduring the early months of the campaign
He got it right is the phrase that conveys the adulation
He describes the company with the clinical pinpoint accuracy that Herman Melville uses to convey life aboard a whaler
Men foul themselves in fear laugh at ghastly wounds inflicted on the enemy learn to fight as if this were one of the Indian wars and when they least expect to show courage or cowardice
And Jones writes in the crisp purposeful language that is the best expression of the clarity of American thought at midcentury
The prose is brutal sardonic pessimistic witty and always to the point
The intervening years may have softened the tone but the voice I hear in Jones is one that at times I can recognize in my father s accounts of the war
Unfortunately I came to Jones after reading a number of Vietnam novels that he inspired
As a result the familiar
Incompetent command is a given in Vietnam novels hardly the revelation that it must have been in Jones
I had expected The Thin Red Line to be the definitive book on Guadalcanal
Instead I found it dated
I could appreciate Jones as one of the masters of war fiction and that this was a novel about more than a South Pacific battle
But it belonged to a generation that was not mine
Mostly I am drawn to the books that in some way tell me literally what it was like for my father on the island
Often these are memoirs like that by Manchester or another by Herbert Merillat whose diary of the fighting published in Gaudalcanal Remembered fleshed out incidents of the battle that I only knew in fragments
Of the Henderson Field shelling on the night of October Merillat wrote The shelter shook as if set in jelly
Although With the Old Breed is not about Guadalcanal E B Sledge s on Peleliu and Okinawa are so vivid that they encompass the earlier battle as Siegfried Sassoon s remembrances of the Somme stand also for Passchendaele and Verdun
But it is not only memoirs and novels that can explain to a son his father s war
Acts of War by the Sandhurst historian Richard Holmes describes the sociology of battle with each chapter covering a subject such as what it is like to endure artillery fire alcohol and combat why men desert or what it is to be wounded
The writing is a lively juxtaposition of literary allusions and eyewitness accounts
In explaining that men fight not out of hatred of the enemy but to maintain the respect of their peers Holmes marshals evidence from Vietnam the Falklands the Civil War and even the holy wars
He writes that the death of a friend is often what ignites an atrocity and quotes among his examples the passage from Manchester on the death of Bob Fowler
That there were bad books mentioned was Guadalcanal Diary written by Richard Tregaskis a newspaperman
He landed with the marines in the early waves spent almost two months on the island and then returned home to write what became a bestseller and a popular movie
Tregaskis s shortcoming was that as a reporter he was free to leave the island at any time
Everyone else had to stick around until they were killed wounded taken prisoner or relieved
In a stock story about Tregaskis my father recalls seeing him once from a distance riding in a general s jeep
That was strike two how could a general understand anything about the front lines After a while Tregaskis evolved into a cautionary tale
He inhabited one world interviewing generals and riding around in jeeps in the other were the men of my father s company some being shot and others dying of dysentery
The fable divided the world between observers and participants
We had no choice we world
It also laid bare one of the great paradoxes of the war
I am sure my father hated the miseries of Guadalcanal and longed to leave the place
But if leaving meant letting down his men or departing the arena for the box seats then he was happy to stay
Ironically another correspondent John Hersey wrote a book that my father praises as the finest on the fighting along the Matanikau River where Paul and I ended our drive
The subtitle of Into the Valley is A Skirmish of the Marines and it is to war what the Elements of Style is to writinga concise primer
The Matanikau flows into the Sealark Channel through what is now Honiara
But during the war it marked the western edge of the wild frontier between the Americans and the Japanese
My father still shudders ever so slightly when discussing it
He likes to quote Daniel Boone s phrase about Kentucky a dark and bloody land
Merillat was like diving into a dark stagnant pool and that it was a maze of ridges fringed with scallops ofjungle
""
The Matanikau does not have the jungle look of a rain forest but it does look like an angry sea where the waves have petrified into sharp hills
Such a landscape offered each side wonderful opportunities for ambushes and Into the Valley describes one that engulfs a company of marines
Pinned down and bloodied the men retreat perhaps not with the haste of those in the Red Badge of Courage but in the same direction
During a lull Hersey asks a group of soldiers what they are fighting for
No one really wants to answer the question
Nor does anyone advance any theories on the geopolitical balance in Asia
Finally one whispers Jesus what I d give for a piece of blueberry pie
Hersey does his best to extrapolate that what the men are really fighting for is to get the Into the Valley was reissued in Hersey returns to this passage If you ask how a nation could win a war whose soldiers would opt for apple pie rather than a chance for heroic death I would be inclined to answer that this is one of the main reasons why our side won
There was a lifesaving skepticism and irony embedded in the confused courage of men bred to free choice
""
In his own writing my father never says why he is fighting
Like many he was drafted and decided to enlist in the marines as an officer before being swept into the asmy as a private
He talks about getting it over about getting home as if he is on an extended business trip
But he also often draws a connection between his enlistment and two childhood summers spent on a bicycle in Germany
By chance he saw Hitler beside the illuminated columns at Nuremburg and Jesse Owens win at the Olympics
He also saw from one year to the were riding and he would speak about how he believed war was inevitableand given what he was seeing probably necessary
Almost stronger than my father s reasons for joining are his impulses to speak about what happened during the fighting
Over the years we have had numerous conversations about the war
They come up at odd times and go into great detail about this action or that officer
Part of his eagerness to talk must be to keep alive memories of those like Bob Fowler or to make sense of eventslike the fighting along the Matanikauthat at the time must have seemed senseless
But it also seems akin to the need among Holocaust survivors to bear witness to make it clear what all wars are about
Hersey who saw not only Guadalcanal but the ruins of Hiroshima and Warsaw reflected in the foreword of Into the Valley One of the things I learned was that war makes no national or racial or ideological distinctions as it degrades human beings
""
I have about his war experiences
Paul Fussell writes that many veterans were numb after the war and reluctant to tell the truth about what happened to them
Fussell believes that a consequence of such silence is a national illusion about the reality of combat
Now fifty years later he writes in Wartime there has been so much talk about The Good War the Justified War the Necessary War and the like that the young and the innocent could get the impression that it was really not such a bad thing after all
It s thus necessary to observe that it was a war and nothing else and thus stupid and sadistic
Ironically it was my father s war stories that first created and later took away a most cherished childhood illusion that of the Good War
That evening at the Mendana Hotel I was conscious of how my time on Guadalcanal had differed from that of my father
Tired from the long hot day I and sleep in an airconditioned room
I did not have to flop alongside a trail or wonder if an artillery shell would find me in an inadequate foxhole
I had even greater admiration for anyone who spent time on the island even the maligned Tregaskis
Darkness spread quickly after sunset as did the mosquitoes that followed me on an afterdinner walk I took to a bridge over the Matanikau
Looking along the cavernous riverbank I was reminded of the last sentence in Wuthering Heights when the narrator standing over a grave site in the moor wonders how anyone could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth
On the way back I passed a few pieces of rusting artillery in front of municipal buildings
Otherwise nothing is a reminder of the battles or makes the connection between this stream and a similar one at Antietam
In the semiofficial history of monuments and driving tours it appears a blank slate
Only books such as Manchester s and Hersey served here keep it alive

The Case of Toynbee Hall
JANE ADDAMS VISITED LONDON for the first time in November 
She was escorted through the slums of the East End by a city missionary as she referred to himperhaps a member of the London City Mission which had been preaching and practicing the social gospel in the East End for halfacentury or perhaps of the more recent Salvation Army an offshoot of the Christian Mission
In any case this was Jane Addams s first encounter with what her guide called the submerged tenth
""
Writing of this incident in her memoir Twenty Years at HullHouse Miss Addams recalled the satisfaction of the guide in uttering the then new phrase as she put it the submerged tenth
In fact the phrase did not become current until seven years later with the publication of General Booth s In Darkest England
Miss Addams did not then meet General Booth the founder did she then meet other prominent members of the London philanthropic community who could have enlightened her about the submerged tenth the Reverend Barnett vicar of St Jude s in Whitechapel who was at that very time planning the establishment of Toynbee Hall which was to be the model for her own Hull House or Octavia Hill whose housing project was in effect a social work program or Charles Loch and Helen Bosanquet who practiced the new science of charity developed by the Charity Organisation Society or Charles Booth no relation to General Booth who had not yet begun his monumental Life and Labour of the People in London but who had just written a private testament affirming his faith in the Comtian Religion of Humanity or Beatrice Webb who was also smitten by that Comtian ideal and was about to embark on her apprenticeship first in social work and then in social research or any of the other men of intellect and property of course in the familiar generic sense whose social consciousness had been aroused and who were devoting their livesliterally their lives not merely their moneyto the service of humanity
On subsequent visits to England Miss Addams was to meet many of these people but never the one person whom she might have found especially congenial Arnold Toynbee
This was most regrettableregrettable not only that she never met the man who inspired Toynbee Hall and thus Hull House but that she could not meet him because he had died earlier that year at the tragically young age of thirty
Shortly before his death Toynbee had delivered a lecture criticizing Henry George s Progress and Poverty
The lecture concluded with a passionate mea culpa
Wethe middle classes I mean not merely the very richwe have neglected you instead of justice we have offered you charity and instead of sympathy we have offered you hard and unreal advice but I think we are changing
I think that many of us would spend our lives in your service
You haveI say it clearly and advisedlyyou have to forgive us for we have wronged you we have sinned against you grievouslynot knowing always but still we have sinned and let us confess it but if you will forgive usnay whether you will forgive us or notwe will serve you we will devote our lives to your service and we can not do more
These words are often quoted as if they came at the very end of the lecture
In fact they were followed by a few sentences in which Toynbee asked for a quid pro quo from the working classes
We will ask you to remember thisthat we work for you in the hope and trust that if you get material civilisation if you get a better life you will really lead a better life
If that is you get material civilisation remember that it is not an end in itself
Remember that man like but like the trees and plants he must grow upwards towards the heavens
If you will only keep to the love of your fellow men and to great ideals then we shall find our happiness in helping you but if you do not then our reparation will be in vain
Today these passages are likely to offend or embarrass us
We may find them mawkish hypocritical condescending at the very least unpersuasive and unrealistic
To try to understand them as contemporaries did is to come to terms with a culture and society very different from oursand to come to terms also with attitudes and assumptions on our own part which may inhibit such an understanding
There are two criticisms commonly made of Victorian philanthropy
The older more familiar criticism is that such philanthropy is obsolete and irrelevant that social problems can not be solved or even remedied by small private voluntary efforts but require either substantial legislative and administrative action by the state or radical institutional this view is not only irrelevant but counterproductive since it distracts attention from any real solution or remedy
Moreover the argument continues it was as obsolete in Victorian times as it is today for industrialism from the beginning and certainly by the end of the nineteenth century created problems that were beyond the scope of individuals
Unemployment for example was not the result of a failure of character on the part of workers or a failure of compassion on the part of employers
And it could not be solved or even alleviated by welldisciplined workers or wellintentioned employers or wellwishing philanthropists
More recently criticism has taken a different turn
The gravamen of the charge now is that philanthropy by its very nature is a selfserving exercise on the part of philanthropists at the expense of those whom they are ostensibly serving
Philanthropy now stands condemned not only as ineffectualthat is the least of its offensesbut as hypocritical even immoral
In place of the original etymological meaning of word is now identified with the love of self
Thus philanthropy is seen as a means of promoting the social status of the philanthropist who is pleased to serve on boards and attend charity balls in the company of titled or royal personages and to receive tokens of gratitude and recognition preferably in the form of a knighthood or peerage
Or it is seen as the occasion for cultivating social connections that result in tangible economic rewards
Or as a way of enhancing the philanthropist s selfesteem and selfapprobation as others respect him more so he respects himself more
Or as a means a relatively painless means of atoning for his sense of guilt possibly for riches unethically acquired
Or as a passport to heaven a record of good works and virtues perhaps to offset some palpably bad works and vices
Or as an opportunity to flaunt one s power and person even to flaunt one s goodness and selflessness
Or as a combination of these motives and many others one can has the effect of impugning the character of philanthropists but not necessarily discrediting their work they may have done good in spite of themselves
But there is another dimension to this argument which does reflect upon the work itself
If philanthropy is seen as serving the interests of individual philanthropists so it may be seen as serving the interests of their class the middle class or bourgeoisie as a Marxist would say
Among historians this thesis goes under the name of social control
In professing to help the poorin encouraging the virtues and habits of sobriety thrift prudence diligence cleanliness orderliness selfdiscipline selfreliancethe philanthropists it is said were imposing upon the poor values that were alien to them and inimical to them
Since they were not workingclass but middleclass values the values of the hegemonic culture as it is said they violated the indigenous workingclass culture
And in violating that culture they undermined the class consciousness and class identity required struggle
Moreover these bourgeois values not only deprived the poor of the means of liberation and emancipation they made them conspire in their own enslavement and exploitation by instilling in them a work ethic designed to make them more productive members of the labor force and more docile members of society
Philanthropy in short was an insidious exercise in social control means of controlling the lower classes and ensuring the hegemony of the upper classes
It is almost impossible to refute this social control thesis empirically
There is no evidence one can adduce that can not be interpreted in these invidious terms
If one philanthropist promoted an educational reform it was because educated workers were more efficient and profitable than uneducated ones and if another opposed that reform it was to keep the poor in a state of ignorance and submission
It is a nowin situation
The only rebuttal is the formal logical one that a theory which can explain anything and everything and which
There is another more fruitful way of addressing this issue by example rather than argument
For instance it has been said is no proof
Yet it is in a wayor as close to proof as history often provides
Such an example is Toynbee Hall one of the philanthropic monuments of lateVictorian England
The first thing to be said about Toynbee Hall is that Toynbee had no part in its founding
Toynbee Hall was established the year after Toynbee s death as a memorial to him
At the time his wife and some of his friends demurred pointing out that Toynbee himself had not been involved in the planning or even conception of the Hall and that his own acquaintance with the East End was limited
Although he had often visited the Barnetts in Whitechapel the only time he actually lived in the East End was as a student at Oxford when he spent a fortnight s vacation doing volunteer work for the Charity Organisation Society
The actual founder of St Jude s who had long been encouraging young men from the universities to visit and work in his parish and decided to formalize this arrangement by establishing a house where they could actually reside
Yet if Toynbee Hall was not the creation of Toynbee it waspace his wifea fitting memorial to him for it was inspired by the idea of citizenship that was at the heart of his philosophy
There is a nice coincidence in the founding of Toynbee Hall in and the passage that year of the Reform Act that gave the suffrage to most of the working class
In a sense the suffrage was the formal manifestation of citizenship and Toynbee Hall its existential realization
For Toynbee as for his mentor the philosopher T H Green citizenship was not only the right to vote although they did not disparage that right it was also the right and the obligation of each citizen to cultivate his best self and to pursue the common good
This positive freedom
In contrast to John Stuart Mill Green insisted that freedom was not the will to do anything and everything the right of every individual to do as he likes so long as he does not prevent another from doing so
The individualor citizen as Green preferredwas a grown man in civil society who wanted more from freedom than the right to do as he likedto get drunk for example
He wanted and deserved the freedom to realize his best self
This was the truly democratic idea of freedom
When we speak of freedom as something to be so highly prized we mean a positive power or capacity of doing or enjoying something worth doing or enjoying and that too something that we do or enjoy in common with others
Every person not just the superior person had the capacity to realize his best self and in community with everyone else to realize the common good citizenship had two essential aspects the pursuit of the best self and the pursuit of the common good
It was this philosophyPhilosophical Idealism as it is calledthat Toynbee adopted from Green and that Barnett wanted to realize in Toynbee Hall
Toynbee Hall was to be civil society writ small a microcosm of the larger community a social laboratory which might achieve on a small scale what could not yet be realized on a large scale
On this model of civil society Barnett himself a minister of the Church of England insisted that Toynbee Hall be nonsectarian which made it especially attractive to the Jews of Whitechapel by the turn of the century onequarter of the students in the university extension courses were Jewish
He also insisted that it was not a mission in any sense
The residents were not missionaries bringing the faith to the heathen nor were they almoners bringing them money food or clothes
They were settlers who came to live among as much as to teach to receive as much as to give
""
The idea of community or fellowship was the inspiring principle of Toynbee Hall
But it was a community and fellowship for a purpose to elicit the best in each individual and the best in the community
The young men who were residents in Toynbee Hall were expected to give the best of themselves so as to cultivate the best in others
They were to be citizens in the higher sense of the word fulfilling their own civic obligations by helping those less privileged than themselves to fulfill their better selves
This explains much about Toynbee Hall that might otherwise be thought inappropriate and peculiar
It explains for example why Toynbee Hall resembled a civic and educational institution more than a charitable institution
It did not dispense relief or charity it dispensed education culture and civic amenities
The calendar of educational activities in a typical month included evening classes on arithmetic writing drawing citizenship for example was on th Century Musicworks by Handel Bach Scarlatti etc afternoon classes for girls on dressmaking writing and composition geography bookkeeping needlework hygiene reading and recitation French singing cooking and swimming and evening sessions devoted to the discussion of legal principles and current social issues
In addition there was a roster of university extension courses that many a modern college might well envy
There were courses on geology physiology botany and chemistry on Hebrew Greek and Latin on European and English history and on a wide range of literary subjects The Pilgrim s Progress Walter Scott and Browning on the Elizabethan dramatists Dekker Lyly and of course Shakespeare this particular month they were reading Hamlet and The Taming of the Shrew on Dante Goethe and French literature Diderot Moliere and Hamlet in French translation
All the heart of the East End the poorest section of London
One is not surprised to find that most of the students attending the university extension courses were as the economics teacher reported the best sort of workers steady thrifty interested in the improvement of their order or that the Latin and Greek students were mainly clerks or small tradesmen although one was a foreman at the docks
The Popular Lectures on Saturday night attracted a wider range of workers who came to hear such lecturers as Charles Booth who used Toynbee Hall as a source of information for his Life and Labour of the People in London Leslie Stephen the writer and editor of the Dictionary of National Biography now more famous as the father of Virginia Woolf Arthur Sidgwick the Greek scholar and his brother Henry Sidgwick the philosopher Mrs Humphry Ward the novelist A V Dicey the jurist the Liberal Party leaders Asquith before notoriety overcame him Oscar Wilde
And then there were all the other activities sponsored by Toynbee Hall a Shakespeare Society an Elizabethan Society a Smoker s club where political passions were supposed to be tempered by tobacco a Travellers club that arranged trips abroad this mainly for local schoolteachers flower shows concerts art exhibits when the paintings and photographs outgrew Toynbee Hall a special building was erected called the Whitechapel Art Palace a library open to the public and utilized by more than people each year andBarnett s personal favorite the Children s Country Holiday Fund in the fund managed to send more than children from the East End to the country for a holiday
The Hall also served as a civic center a meeting place for trade unions and strike committees county council and school board officials social workers and investigators tenant representatives and other local groups
In addition and not least was Toynbee fifteen or so young men who lived in it for periods ranging from three months to several years
The Hall has been criticized for serving the interests of the residents better than those of the community
But this is to misunderstand its essential purpose
From the beginning the residential function was given at least as much weight as the communal function indeed the two were seen as integrally related because they both derived from the idea of citizenship
The young men were to live among the poor so that they would become better acquainted with them move more easily among them understand and sympathize with them and assist them in whatever way they could but they were not to live the life of the poor or lose themselves in the service of the poor
They were not to be latterday Saint Francises
On the contrary they were to show the poor the possibility of a more elevated more gracious more fulfilling life a life that the poor would not be able to emulate but that could
Toynbee Hall was not simply a settlement house it was a university settlement not only because its residents were university men and because it offered university extension courses but also because it was deliberately constructed except for its redbrick facade to resemble a college hall
It contained suites and bedsitters for the residents much like those in an Oxford college a classroom that could accommodate three hundred a conversation room a drawing room and a large dining room cum library decorated with the crests of Oxford and Cambridge colleges
In this collegial setting civilised but without undue luxury or display the architect described itthe residents lived
And here the workers in the neighborhood came to attend classes and meetings mingling with university men and community leaders and living at least briefly a mode of life very different from their own
Other settlements founded soon afterwards were named Oxford House Balliol House and Wadham House
""
The residents paid it was regarded as a privilege not everyone could purchase a residency there
Applicants had to be approved by a committee of residents were admitted on probation and had to be confirmed after three months
And the residents were bound by strict house rules that were more reminiscent of boarding schools than of colleges
They dined at specified hours had a fixed bedtime and were assigned particular duties
Whether they worked in the East End or pursued careers as teachers civil servants or lawyers elsewhere in the city they were all expected to devote their spare time to communal affairs
Barnett described them not ironically as clubmen but their club resembled a religious order more than the familiar West End variety
Toynbee Hall he wrote seems to its visitors to be a centre of education a mission a centre of social effort
It may be so but the visitors miss the truth that the place is a clubhouse in Whitechapel the neighborhood
When William Beveridge author of the Beveridge Report the founding document as it were of the welfare state was subwarden of Toynbee Hall in he delivered a paper entitled The Influence of University Settlements which was devoted entirely to their influence upon the residents
The paper he confessed was a foolish legpull but it had a serious point which was that the essence of the settlement lay in the individual lives of the residents as they are affected by the special experience of living in that particular place
Jane Addams said of Hull House that it was more for the people who do it than for the other class
She also explained that her first reason for founding Hull House was to give purpose and meaning to her own life her second was the desire to help the poor
""
Today these statements would be regarded as evidence of the elitist authoritarian selfserving nature of purposes of the social workers rather than of their clients and designed to imbue the working class with a middleclass culture as well as a middleclass ethic
To Barnett as to Jane Addams these statements testified to the democratic nature of the institution
The rich and the poor they believed had a common commitment to citizenship and required a common education for that civic vocation
They also assumed that the poor as much as the rich were able and willing to receive such an education because they shared a common human nature
This was what Jane Addams meant when she said that it was important to hold all men to one democratic standard
And it was what Green meant when he insisted that man by naturenot by class breeding wealth or some special grace but by simple human naturewas a rational moral being capable of realizing his best self and pursuing the common good
This was also what contemporaries meant when they spoke of the settlement house as a bridge between the metaphor
That bridge was not meant to abolish either class or individual TOOLONG of wealth occupation status or talent
It was meant rather to bridge them to establish the common denominator of citizenship that made tolerable those other distinctions which were natural and inevitable but which should not be exacerbated and should not be allowed to obscure the common claim to citizenship
The settlement house was not an experiment in socialism it was an experiment in democracywhich was no mean feat at that time and place
It is often said that the great achievement of Toynbee Hall like that of Hull House was the training of a professional corps of social administrators who later assumed important positions in the departments and agencies of the statethe social service state as the forerunner of the welfare state has been called and then the welfare state itself
One can produce a roster of such namesBeveridge sometimes known as the father of the welfare state Clement Attlee the prime minister who actually inaugurated host of others less familiar today but well known at the time
No doubt in the early twentieth century Toynbee Hall did serve in a sense as a training and recruitment center for the expanding state
But if this was its main achievement one would have to say that it was a failure at least from the point of view of its founders
For this was not what they intended and it was not the spirit that informed it in the first decades of its history
The founders and early residents had no objection to social legislation indeed they publicly advocated it
In a lecture delivered the year before he died Are Radicals Socialists Toynbee explained that the Radicals that is the Radical faction of the Liberal Party had already committed themselves to so much of the Socialist programme In the form of factory acts sanitation and health acts land actsthat the continental form of socialism which sought to abolish private property was totally in an article the following year on Practicable Socialism which he identified with the Poor Law the Education Act the Irish Land Acts the Artisans Dwellings Act the Libraries Act and the like
But these socialist measures he insisted were no substitute for the kind of institution represented by Toynbee Hall
In arguing for the irrelevancy or inadequacy of the settlement house or the housing projects or the Salvation Army or Barnardo s Homes for children or any other Victorian philanthropy or for that matter any modern philanthropy critics make it sound as if this particular institution alone was meant to solve the social problem or even any one aspect of that problempoverty or housing or neglected children or what have you
In fact the Victorians no less than modern philanthropists were acutely aware of the multiplicity of agencies private and public which complemented and supplemented one anotherand as often as not duplicated one personally associated with not one but several causes and institutions the result was something like a network of interlocking directorates
This is what Sidney Webb meant when he said Nothing in England is done without the consent of a small intellectual yet practical class in London not in number
Even the most laissezfairist representatives of this philanthropic class the leaders of the Charity Organisation Society were engaged in organizing and coordinating not only private charities but public relief as well
Others took the initiative in urging various forms of state intervention Barnett and Charles Booth were among the earliest and most vigorous proponents of a statefinanced and administered oldage pension system
But all including the socialists among them believed that the expanded role of the state made it all the more necessary to support private voluntary associations to do what the state could not or should not do
And the main thing the state could not do was what Walter Besant the Fabian socialist defined as the principle of the new philanthropy
This returns us once more to the concept of citizenship as Green and his disciples understood it
A citizen was not a subjectnot even the subject of a benevolent state
Toynbee was as opposed to Tory or paternalistic socialism as he called it as to Marxist or continental socialism
He was opposed to both because they both violated the essential principle of citizenship which was also the essential principle of positive freedom that citizens should be free to cultivate their best selves and to pursue the common good
Historians often use such words as vague and illogical ambivalent and ambiguous transitional and halfway house to describe this generation of philanthropists reformers and social philosophers
The implication is that lateVictorian England can only be understood as a prelude to the welfare state or as some historians would have it a prelude to socialism and that anything short of that was vague ambiguous transitional and halfway
This assumption that the welfare state or socialism represents the logical necessary rational culmination of social policy is a typical symptom of what has been called the Whig fallacy tendency to read the past in the light of the present to see history as a progressive movement of events institutions and principles
If most Victorians demurred at a large extension of state control if they persisted in expending their energy and resources on private voluntary philanthropies it could only be the argument goes because of their commitment to an outmoded ideology or vested interest or because of a failure of imagination or will or in the most sophisticated version of this theory because the administrative apparatus of the state was incapable of coping with the economic and social needs of the time
This mode of reading history does justice neither to the past nor to the present
It does not begin to appreciate the Victorians their problems and more subtle and sophisticated thought than we sometimes give them credit for
There are in fact very few criticisms currently made of them that they did not anticipate and try to addressand not only criticisms of their policies and institutions but of themselves personally their motives and behavior
Reading their books and memoirs one is struck by how modern so many of them sound in their sensitivity to accusations selfaccusations for the most part of condescension complacency callousness obtuseness selfishness
This is not to say that they were paragons of virtue or sensibility
But many of themand most of the more prominent oneswere at least as thoughtful analytic and selfcritical as their counterparts today
In one respect they were more admirable than their successors
To use an unVictorian metaphor they put their money where their mouths wereand more than their money their careers and lives
At no other time did so many people of distinction give so much of themselves is seen as a flaw
Just as private voluntary institutions are regarded as inferior to public compulsory ones so the voluntary unpaid social worker is considered amateurish compared with the paid professional and the philanthropist ineffectual compared with the government official
It may be argued however that the modern mode is not all that superior to the Victorian one in practical terms and far less superior less estimable in personal and moral terms
Professionalization as we have painfully discovered breeds bureaucratization and both produce their own peculiar varieties of inefficiency and insensitivity
If Whig history does less than justice to the past it also does more than justice to the present
Have our present progressive social institutions and arrangements given us that much cause for selfcongratulation Are we so confident of the superiority of our own system of welfare that we can afford to be condescending to the Victorians Are we so satisfied with the results of the welfare state to say nothing of socialism more vigorously in that direction Is the situation of our own underclass so much better than that of the submerged tenth that Jane Addams encountered on her first trip to London And when we agonize over the social pathology as we say of the underclass breakup of the family the prevalence of drugs crime illiteracy and illegitimacy the compulsion for instant gratification and the inability to defer gratification are we not implicitly invoking the kinds of middleclass values indeed Victorian values with which we reproach the Victorians It is worth keeping such questions in mind as we pass judgment on those Victorian philanthropists and reformers whom we speak of rather derisively as moralists
""
Those Victorians exemplified by the founders of Toynbee Hall and of Hull House were avowedly unashamedly incorrigibly moralists
They were moralists on their own behalfthey founded Toynbee Hall and Hull House in good part to satisfy their own moral needs whom they sought to elevate morally spiritually culturally and intellectually as well as materiallywhom moreover they assumed to be capable of and desirous of such elevation
To one historian this is evidence of an authoritarian disposition
To this historian it suggests an eminently democratic one

Section BIOGRAPHY Edmund Wilson at Princeton
For readers of twentiethcentury American literature the Princeton of has derived its significance from Scott Fitzgerald s romantic sensibility
There at the head of the white platoon marched Allenby Fitzgerald writes of the captain of the team in This Side of Paradise translating a chivalric vision into the terms of college spirit
He memorializes a scene of football heroes torchlight parades and step singing in the evenings with an underlying social tension derived from the struggle to be a big man on campus
In the same vein his friend John Peale Bishop called the campus with its green lawns and new gothic buildings its undergraduate elegance and gaiety one of the most desired and desirable places in America in which to loiter through four years of one s youth
""
Fitzgerald s vision of Princeton accords with his wellknown memory of Edmund Wilson as the shy little scholar of Holder Court a marginal figure without the assurance following year
It is a misleading image tainted by Fitzgerald s deference to a social success achieved with studied nonchalance
At Princeton Wilson already felt compelled to take his ideals outside the cloister playing a part upon the public stage
If in some sense he was a shy scholar working away at Plato and Dante with his dictionaries late at night his exuberant commitment to literature and ideas his physical vigor and his tenacity enabled him to assume authority among his artistic and literary friends Fitzgerald included
These apprentice years would help him to become a guide to readers and writers of the twenties to fuse politics with literature in the thirties and afterwards
As an undergraduate he was beginning to participate in the shared enterprise Wilson himself once described as an effort to make something of America to make an American culture
""
Unlike Fitzgerald s hero Gatsby Wilson was not a child of some Platonic conception of himself
He was a bookish youth with a discipline that had
In boarding school he had acquired a good English style classical aesthetic ideals and an aspiration to be a man of letters
He had the confidence of being from an old Princeton family
His father and half a dozen uncles had gone to college in the s and s
Now attorney general of New Jersey Edmund Wilson Sr had been a leader of student opinion as an undergraduate
For his part in a rebellion against the faculty he was rusticated sent north to the small town of Kingston for the balance of the year
As a freshman the younger Wilson lived in a dormitory financed by his father s class next door to Sterling Carter the son of one of his father s classmates and the two young men helped each other out as their fathers had Wilson acting out the speeches in Shakespeare for Carter who did math with him
His best friend at The Hill School Stanley Dell had come on to Princeton as had of these students would pursue literature philosophy or the fine arts professionally while others would go on to careers in law medicine or public life
As undergraduates some of them held to the standard of gentleman s C and avoided the onus attached to nonconformist behavior
There were others however as serious as Wilson was and they had the leisure to study and write in the Oxonian campus bordered by the eighteenthcentury facades of Nassau Street
Woodrow Wilson president of Princeton from to had found and employed such distinguished men as Christian Gauss who established the modern languages department and the Kantian philosopher Norman Kemp Smith he introduced the preceptorial system of instruction which emphasized small discussion groups
In these years before the United States entered World War I the first signs of the renascence of the twenties were appearing around the country and the intellectual life of the old universities was invigorated
This intellectual Princeton overlapped with that of the majority
As a at that time a struggle with the sophomores for control of the gym doors and attended the Yale and Harvard games
To Alfred Bellinger his successor as editor of the literary magazine at Hill he writes of how a jovial company of us went down to Trenton to see Pinafore performed by what turned out to be a terrible stock company
The students harassed the performers stomping their feet when Sir Joseph Porter walked across the stage and throwing peppermints at the leading lady until six ponderous cops marched in like the Policemen s Chorus in the Pirates of Penzance
He organized and led a walking trip of Hill alumni back to Pottstown over a weekend a distance of about seventyfive miles
Detesting sports that were compulsory he enjoyed moonlight skating through the level country solitudes of Stony Brook in the winter and canoe trips late in the spring
In vacations not eager to return to a strained home situation in Red Bank he was happy York in the town of Washington Connecticut where Alfred and Sterling Carter both came from and in New Hampshire
In old age Wilson would halfnostalgically recall these families who were welltodo or if not belonged through their family connections and who occupied positions of responsibility Their conversation afforded perspective on the collegiate scene
There was little academic pressure in the first college years as Wilson s letters to Bellinger show
Up betimes and to McCosh Hall where I am examined in College Algebra which God help me I fear I did do very ill the freshman writes in the style of Pepys s Diary
Thence to dinner and after to Sir Stanley s chamber We do copy Sir Stanley s Hygiene notes and thank Heaven that there be one conscientious enough to attend all the lectures
Science courses were not much more than playing chemistry in the lab
Incompetent in practical matters he attached the apparatus he had
After his regimen at Hill the English courses seemed absurdly superficial
Dr Johnson was a very great man who had a very great influence on his age he later wrote in a parody
Tomorrow gentlemen we shall take up Wordsworth Byron and Burns
For the preceptorial read Congreve s The Way of the World
Modern literature was not part of the curriculum
In Wilson would recall Ernest Dowson and Oscar Wilde were the latest sensational writers who had got in past the stainedglass windows of the library
Edmund however immersed himself in current British writers and in the spring of his freshman year he joined the board of the Nassau Literary Magazine where many of his activities and interests of the next years are recorded
As an undergraduate reviewer he commented on the social prophecies of Shaw and Wells Chesterton s criticism and the caricatures of Max Beerbohm as well as novelists from Meredith to Arnold Masefield then changed his mind
His letters to Bellinger chart his artistic discoveries and discriminations documenting the educated taste of the time
They had decided to exchange books that might challenge the other s taste
Twitting his friend for conservative and Anglophile prejudicesthough he himself still called Browning the greatest poet of all time Wilson defended his preferences among the Edwardians
He commented on French writers he was reading in class on Ibsen whom Dell and he had discovered on Dostoyevsky
He adopted an authoritative manner and formality of tone in contrast to the boyish exuberance and wit with which he told Bellinger of college life
Wilson retained a rather English tone as his tastes broadened and he soon acquired an English bicycle then a rarity on campus
In his Greek studies as an upperclassman he was using the giltedged editions published at Oxford by the Clarendon Press
From a dictionary that had been his father s where he found a pressed rose that he celebrated in a quaint poem huge Liddell and Scott the same lexicon that had been used by Browning Arnold Swinburne Pater Wilde and Thomas Hardy
Late at night at a rolltop desk with a gooseneck lamp he worked away at the elegant nuances of Homer Plato and Aristophanes against the backdrop of the drunken singing of collegians on the way back to their dorms from the Nassau Inn
Although he avoided further English courses he was saturated in this English culture
Socrates was one of his heroes
Swift was another
Writing to Alfred as a junior and senior Edmund finds Macaulay admirable for his scrupulous thoroughness his sound literary conscience and his knowledge and acceptance of his own limitations He had one of those able dogmatic and stubborn minds of which Johnson was a great typical example in the eighteenth century and Chesterton a perhaps somewhat enfeebled on in our own
Boswell had a novelist s skill at biography and his Scotch honesty compelled him to tell the truth one
All these qualities would in time emerge in Wilson s writing
Despite his later patriotic Americanisms Wilson never outgrew his enthusiasm for literary England
The pinnacle of this enthusiasm which would return in his relationships with English men of letters after World War II was a summer tour with friends in following his sophomore year
England he thought in awed ecstacy as their ship entered the Mersey
They bicycled from Edinburgh through the Lake Districthe read Wordsworth s Prelude in the eveningsand on through the cathedral towns as far as Wales before they cheated by taking the train for a few hours
On a solitary pilgrimage to Meredith s house in Surrey where half a dozen great novels were written he began a journal he would keep off and on for the rest of his life
He also left the group and went to London where he enjoyed the spectacle of Beerbohm Tree and Mrs Patrick Campbell ignoring Shaw s direction Ghosts a horrible thing and much more so for being wonderfully acted went to art exhibitions Westminster Abbey and the music halls and bought a huge tome of Henry James
His wardrobe was inadequate and his old suitcase came apart on a station platform but in a shirt borrowed from one friend and a tie borrowed from another he charged around London by bus and taxi reveling in all his associations with the street names
He bought new clothes to Bellinger reporting I persuaded an aged duke to sell me modest articles of attire
With American irreverence Wilson had turned the mysteries of making lemon squash in the hotel dining room into a magic trick
I showed the ladies and gentlemen that I had nothing but a bottle of soda a bowl of sugar and a very little lemon Juice at the bottom of a large glass
When he put the sugar which he had doctored in the glass lemonade ascended like a waterspout and the table was flooded
It was as much fun as Chemistry he proclaimed
The group was unable to go on to Paris for on the bank holiday of August England declared war on Germany
Although Edmund expected that the war might be over in weeks he was dismayed by the popular enthusiasm people were riding on the top of taxis cheering in the crowded streets a mob around Buckingham Palace calling for the King and QueenMary we re wyting making them come back to the balcony over and over again I wondered whether they thought that the war was all going to be a tremendous bank holiday
He was glad to get return passage to the States he would oppose American entry into the war just as his father did
Back at Princeton he enviously savored the literary past of Oxford and Cambridge
You walk along a street cross a little stream stand in the quad of a by shady paths and following close on the joy of discovery as soon as you have learned its name you begin to remember the great ones of fiction and history who have stood exactly where you have stood he wrote as the new editor of the Lit in an article protesting the absence of authentic great men and a literary heritage in his own university
The only remedy he concluded was to bring about the celebrated events and become the great men ourselves with a view to our successors We must indeed set ourselves to the task of living up to posterity

Thus the young Edmund Wilson prepared for his part in the history that included Britain s loss of cultural dominance and the flowering of American writing already beginning during World War I To a welleducated undergraduate of the time American literature seemed provincial
Bored by the New England poets of the schoolroom by Dr Holmes s wonderful onehoss shay and Whittier s of the American masters until the twenties when Melville s reemergence would contribute to a new canon
At school however he had given his sixth form oration on O Henry rather than a classical subject and had enjoyed the rollicking Mencken of The Smart Set lists of pet peeves the catalogs of daily experiences
Reading Mencken in college he was led to Huckleberry Finn and to JamesMencken pronounced What Maisie Knew A passionate Masterpiece
In a letter to Bellingerthat also includes a long discussion of DeQuincy s stylehe announces the discovery of two American masterpieces James s The Turn of the Screw and Wharton s Ethan Frome
James is the subject of his first literary essay which appeared in when the novelist was still alive and criticism of his art only beginning
Wilson liked James s tight dramatic staging and a classmate helped him understand the mannered conversation of the characters explaining that this was an aesthetic convention like any other
Although knew America better Wilson admired James s opposition of imagination and urbanity to moral responsibility James s fine Puritanism
Paradise Lost is not a more real struggle between the spirits of good and evil than The Turn of the Screw he declared
He went on reading Wharton James and Edwin Arlington Robinsonhe met Robinson who visited the collegeas well as Mencken and James Huneker writers outside this AngloAmerican tradition
Huneker s Egoists published in introduces a generation to European literature
Mencken s literary and social criticism strengthened Edmund s interest in working in our own field
At Princeton a maverick English professor defended Whitman to his classes Born on Long Island died in Camdenfound life beautiful Dr Spaeth used to roar in defiance of people who living close to Camden assumed that it was too far away from the localities mentioned in The Scholar Gypsy to inspire the right kind of poetry
One a privately printed book by a doctor in nearby Rutherford New Jersey unconventional poetry that had a kind of spare dignity though they did not know quite what to make of it
The poet was William Carlos Williams
Wilson noted ONeill s early oneact plays in the Lit and in was excited by Van Wyck Brooks s America s ComingofAge
Old enough to be educated in the English tradition before the war he would bring its values and skills to his role as interpreter of the emerging American culture
Ironically the last major man of letters in the English line was to be an American literary nationalist
In a photograph as an upperclassman Edmund Wilson appears austere and purposeful looking as if he had been studying more than was socially desirable at Princeton
He believed that he could subject himself to the control of his mind could make himself do what he thought he should be doing
In this way of thinking Wilson was strongly influenced by secularized eraser instead of applying himself to the page of Homer before him he grandiloquently despaired Calvin I understand you Jonathan Edwards you are justifies
But he also made life fun for his literary friends for he loved jokes parodies and literary hoaxes
Entering into the majority Princeton he wrote the book for the Triangle Show called The Evil Eye
Red haired eager tireless he bubbled with ideas and threw them out by the handful Christian Gauss recalled of his student and future friend
He was carrying the war into the country of the Philistines as Gauss put it defending the standards of the intellectual minority in editorials about the curriculum and the social system
In temperament and taste Wilson s friends ranged widely
Bill Mackie drank and was a partygoer yet he and Edmund did advanced work together in Latin a subject in which Wilson considered himself poorly prepared
He had believed Latin boring on account of succeeded in discovering Catullus s love poems and the Eclogues and Georgics of Virgil
In the evenings he read Tibullus with Mackie
I have never known anyone droller or more sensitive to literature Wilson recalled in old age
Bill had a racy wit and was a master of Pepys s Diary style he describes his summer reading in an eighteenthcentury script and manner that might fool us were it not for the references to Max Nordau s Degeneration and other books of the s
Edmund however was uneasy over Bill s reading without even a system or aim over the miscellaneous piles of books strewn on the floor of his room when he drifted away from literature Wilson was disappointed but not surprised
At the other extreme was John Wyeth the pure aesthete of the class who seemed all too willing to leave the real world to the Philistines
Wyethwho became a painter like his famous relativesplayed Debussy late into the advent of World War I by renting a cottage in the chateau district of France and amusing himself playing the piano
He was the one who taught Wilson how to read Henry James
Near the end of his life he recalled how Edmund and he by some mystery elected to a club discussed literature and art at dinner alone among the socialites and jocks Wilson not in the least intimidated
There was something wonderful about him Wyeth said
The campus writers Wilson thought most talented were Stanley Dell his friend from Hill John Peale Bishop who succeeded him as editor of the magazine and Scott Fitzgerald who entered the group through his friendship with John
Dell was a sophisticate who had lived much abroad
A student of philosophy he wrote with a clarity and sensitivity that seemed to have all the makings of a novelist
Bishop was a southerner with a self assurance that his friends considered aristocratic he was something of a dandy and a libertine he derived his romanticism from Swinburne and Shelley but before he left college he was imitating Yeats and Pound
Wilson and Bishop first regarded Fitzgerald with the ambivalence of bookish undergraduates toward a manipulator bent on social success
In Wilson s attitude there was a measure of snobbery toward someone who was both a practicing Catholic and a product of the Middle Westthe latter circumstance from which Fitzgerald rather suffered though he romanticized it at the end of The Great Gatsby
One day as readers of the dedicatory poem for The CrackUp know Scott left at Wilson s door a story of a bohemian artist called Shadow Laurels which for all its romantic cliche had a lyric power
Correcting the spelling and syntax Wilson published the story in the Lit in the spring of 
Another time he came on Fitzgerald waiting for him in his room a creature strange to college intently pinching out his pimples in the mirror that reflected his pale
Wilson would always admire the assurance that was part of Fitzgerald s narcissistic strain
That summer Scott was doing the lyrics for the Triangle Show while Edmund struggled with the libretto and the next fall these two with Bishop and Dell were in the same preceptorial of Christian Gauss s French course
By the time that Fitzgerald withdrew from college under cover of illness to avoid academic suspension a basis had been laid for his and Wilson s friendship after the war as they emerged in the complementary roles of artist and critic
Fitzgerald s imaginative gift and his resilience would enable him to profit by Wilson s biting criticisms of his first novels
As upperclassmen these literati grew critical of the Princeton social system
This was the Indian Summer of the College Customs era in our campus life Gauss writes
Freshmen still had to wear black caps and jerseys and stay away from the elegant club buildings on Prospect Street until the elections in the spring of the sophomore year defended in the Princetonian
Fitzgerald the outsider who identified the gentlemanly ideal of the college with the pageantry he loved could also apparently feel that they were hollow
The idol of the young hero of This Side of Paradise Dick Humbird who apparently can do anything and make it look right is killed when driving drunk and Humbird later appears as the devil
When the president of the university objected to his novel
Fitzgerald replied that the whole social system was conceived uniquely for students without talent or imagination
""
John Peale Bishop s later portrait of Princeton in The Smart Set ends on a similar note
After defending its leisurely aristocratic life he confesses at the last moment that if he should have a son of notable intelligence and promise he will lock him up in a library till he is old enough to send to Paris
Neither Scott nor John said such things about students
Stanley Dell however attacked the religion of mediocrity in what purported to be a Letter from a French Graduate in the Lit of 
Intellectually independent and socially an insider a member of one of the best clubs Dell laughed at the figure of the confident collegian justifying the course of least resistance by an ideal he has himself created able to find in the big game the rush and the Triangle Show an alternative to learning in college
The essential issue for the intellectual minority at Princeton during these years was the eating clubs
Woodrow Wilson had tried to replace these with residential quads an aborted reform that setting the pattern of his frustrations as a political leader would be the subject of Edmund s essay Woodrow Wilson at Princeton
In college the critic recalled I read and listened to Wilson s speeches and accepted him as a shining champion in the war against sordid business a reformerintellectual in politics At first Edmund had nothing against the clubs halls of good fellowship
As a sophomore he tried not to get too nervous about the elections and when Dell s club passed him over ostensibly for lack of special ability or noticeable brains he was glad to go into a more modest one
He found that all he did there was eat and read the papers
John Bishop makes the same point stating that the trouble with the clubs is that once in them they matter so little after having seemed to matter so much
As a senior Wilson concluded that the clubs were a barrier to the intellectual Princeton he had come to believe in through his best professors
His objections were not egalitarian
He respected the Yale senior societies like Skull and Bones where intellectual ability was recognized and the selection came late enough in one s college career to be an incentive to merit
The Princeton system on the other hand turned the first two college years into a quest for social approval that lot of fools cads and snobs he declared in his final editorial in the Lit
If saying this did not make Wilson popular in his class the minority for whom he spoke were getting stronger
In more than a quarter of the sophomore class led by Dick Cleveland the expresident s son refused to join a club in an effort to bring the system down
He looked on other aspects of college life with a humorous tolerance he may have acquired from Bishop who was not so weary of college spirit as was Dell
Eventually however he attacked those conservatives who were committed to defending any custom handed down to them except perhaps the practice of throwing snowballs through the windows into lecture rooms to get the professor s goat
The romanticization by many of the good old days provoked his best undergraduate prose
Those were the days of happiest carelessness the loosest organization and the most perfunctory regard for the classroom
to suggest as their only redeeming feature
A procession was held at midnight to celebrate Halley s Comet A doctor s excuse could be had for a quarter when one did not like a lecturer on prevented him from talking when one was bored by a preacher one cut him short by coughing
We have mentioned elsewhere that triumphant cry engraved forever on the pavement of Dickinson Street WHO WON THE RUSH 
Fancy the time when people cared for such things But how naive how merry they must have been Those were the days of boyishness fresh and unaffected that is they were days of prevalent drunkenness cheating in examinations intellectual cowardice and repression indiscriminate mockery general ignorance and the branding as a sad bird of anyone who tried to rise above it
This is what Wilson meant when in old age he said I enjoyed the pleasant Princeton life except when my reforming zeal would come to the surface
As editor he with Shaw and Wells as immediate models
Witty and fervent they have the lucidity and conversational ease of his mature criticism
Wilson also wrote literary essays and short stories set to verse his thoughts about the artist and education and recorded undergraduate life and talk in his journal
In addition to this one on James he wrote essays on Stendhal and Huysmans
As a sophomore he experienced the hereditary AngloSaxon trepidation i n the presence of a French immorality and decadence he found more attractive than he cared to say
He condescended to Stendhal s worldly irony in a piece that in old age Wilson called hypocritical guff stating that he had much admired Stendhal
An unpublished manuscript on Huysmans locates this apostle of bohemian freedom in a suffocating cul de sac
He laments Huysmans s inability to create characters outside himself describing his story as the second rate tragedy of a man perverted by too much culture and bored to death by civilization
These are solipsistic aspect of modernism in Axel s Castle where Proust is said to have put into practice the regime which Huysmans invented for his hero
During this time Wilson s poems were already an outlet for the private reflection he would try to keep out of his criticism
They contain his thoughts about the heroism of writers and artists Swift The Dark Hour Whistler at Battersea the drama of education
Princeton by night apparently The Sleeping College is in fact a stage where learning lives and human souls find birth
To Bellinger he confessed the fear that I have nt much distinction in the use of wordsnot for poetic purposes anyhow
The journal he began in England would become a source of his writings in other forms
The college years contain interesting details
The Protestant freethinker took note when Scott Fitzgerald remarked I can go up to New York on a terrible party and then come back and go into the An effete insipid undergraduate life is also visible in this potpourri of descriptive passages lists of expressions book titles remarks the young man thought pointed or witty enough to set down
On the other hand the act of recording experience on the page was important to Wilson whose memory for details of personality and scene would be the source of much of his lasting work
Some of his fiction reflects his uneasy relationships with his parents
In one story an ostensible expose of the dullness of New Jersey life a boy s father dies liberating the son to contemplate an ambition very different from his father s and to explore the world at least as far as the corner drug store
In the Oedipal triangle of Below Stairs published in the June Wilson graduated a jockey is hired by his boss to run away with the man s wife and not return
When the two fall in love and return to New York catastrophe follows the hero ineffectually tries the wife reading of her lover s fate in the newspaper repudiates this evil world for a convent
Below Stairs suggests how little he knew of girls his own age the debutantes whom his friends were taking to dances
He was aware of a certain awkwardness in these stories
To Bellinger he reports that Teek Whipple came in and burst into roars of laughter at the sentence I had written which was My God girl said the doctor
We do nt wear wigs in America and really one can hardly blame him because it is certainly a little startling out of its context
That he had to work at his fiction with a strain that his critical writing lacked would not modify Wilson s ambitions in this genre
When Wilson in the early twenties looked back on Princeton in an article on the Ivy League schools he evoked not the social atmosphere that his friends wrote about but a humanistic ideal
If the muchtalkedof social would survive where one could read Plato in Greek and with the appreciation of a peer
Twenty years later he wrote that in my youth you read Shakespeare Shelley George Meredith Dostoevsky Ibsen and you wanted however imperfectly and on however infinitesimal a scale to learn their trade and have the freedom of their company
This is not an arbitrary listShakespeare and Shelley had also made their mark on him
The sense of meeting the great writers on their own level distinguishes this literary generation from its successors produced by American universities
Appreciation and emulation were for them as closely connected as were criticism and imaginative writing
Eliot Stevens and Pound were followed by Dos Passos and Cummings at Harvard Wilson Fitzgerald and their friends at Princeton
After Fitzgerald s death Dos Passos remarked that he had raised the level of American fiction to follow in some such way as Marlowe s blank verse line raised the whole level of Elizabethan verse
Their undergraduate literary educations were important to life
This was conspicuously true of Wilson given his shortcircuited connections with his father
At school he had turned to the fierce but benign discipline of his Greek teacher Mr Rolfe and in college he found heroes in Christian Gauss and Norman Kemp Smith who would turn out to be lifetime friends
Gauss was then thirtyfive and an outsider in genial Princeton
In his old raincoat passing by on the walk with pale cheeks and shuttered gaze sometimes accompanied by a shabby mongrel dog named Baudelaire he had an air of the nineties for the campus writershe was known to have been a journalist in Paris and shared drinks with Oscar Wilde
He make a formidable impression in the lecture course on Dante having the same command of the classroom as of the subject
He expounded on Dante s code of loyalty to the truth no matter where it led or whom it hurt and the idea of il ben del intelletto that good of the intellect poet s art was polished and carefully planned and knew how to make its points and the meaning of the points it was making
For Gauss Dante conveyed the whole spectrum of human passions in an orderly vision that implied also a reasoned morality and he made his students feel that no Englishman could have accomplished this even Shakespeare
His bete noire was Robert Browning whom he portrayed as a tonedeaf beefeater concocting facile moral dramas in Italy while Dante s ghost looked on in wry disdain
In private Gauss would admit to having acquired a lot of bad doctrine from Browning in youth
This was the future critic s introduction to the continental aesthetic which gave the writers of the twenties perspective on English literature and a way to see their native materials
Dante had much the same value for Eliot and Pound different as they were from each other as well as from Wilson
Flaubert was the writer who took this standard into modern idea of the world
When Gauss lectured on Flaubert in his French course Wilson recalls He made us all want to write something in which every word every cadence every detail should perform a definite function in producing an intense effect
Edmund was soon emulating the search for le mot juste in his journal
After the war he would exhort Fitzgerald to practice Flaubert s objectivity and irony advice that helped to shape the novelist s development between This Side of Paradise and The Great Gatsby something that Wilson later politely attributed to Gauss s influence
Gauss s French course helped lay the basis for Edmund Wilson s criticism
Beginning with Voltaire and Rousseau the professor expounded the romantics the philosophy of naturalism the symbolism of the fin de siecle much as Wilson does in the background chapter of Axel s Castle
He taught Michelet as well as Renan
Taine and Anatole France all of whom would at one time later historiancritics as victims of a palsying pessimism somewhat as Wilson does in the first section of To The Finland Station
Gauss introduced the young man to SainteBeuve whom Edmund wanted to emulate until impatience with the gossipy journalistic aspect of the Causeries de lundi sent him to Arnold to whom SainteBeuve owed so much
In Voltaire he found the essence of the wit and irony he enjoyed in Flaubert and other French writers and Voltaire also exemplified the ideals of the Enlightenment Making him want to be a soldier in the Liberation War of humanity
It can be argued that Johnson s Lives of the Poets and Boswell s Life influenced the critic more than anything in Voltaire just as Arnold s effect on him matched that of SainteBeuve and Taine
In youth however he was rebelling against the British tradition which was less consciously aesthetic and more politically conservative than the French
France had the attraction of being a though he worked at the writers with dictionary in hand
Later in life he would grow into his inheritance from the English
Gauss s teaching methods also made Wilson aspire to an encyclopedic knowledge and to the historical point of viewone that remained more congenial to him than what he would see as the obscurantism and dogma of many theorists
Gauss talked about personalities as well as texts
He believed that moral issues were real which made him an effective interpreter of French aestheticism to a morally earnest young man
The artist s code was not he said that of the citizen or the churchgoer
When Edmund defined as humane an impulse to avoid telling a friend who wanted to contribute to the Lit that his manuscript was terrible Gauss suggested the right word was weak
In preceptorials he usually confined himself to Socratic questioning
When he asked where beauty justice goodness and other values come from and Wilson replied Out of the imaginations of is correct
It was a memorable moment for the student who fifteen years later used this phrase in criticizing Eliot s assertion that civilization depended on the Christian church
Gauss shared the enlightenment philosophy that the world was real and that we ourselves may find some sense in it and make ourselves happy in it that Wilson took as his own
After World War I Wilson would go down from New York to Princeton to visit Christian Gauss and they would exchange letters but in his college years theirs was not a personal relationship
He knew Gauss only in class and in casual campus conversation
Revering him from afar he brought a driving intensity to the ideas and ideals that they shared projecting onto the professor a Promethean ambition
Wilson did not have the same stake in his more informal relationship with the philosopher Norman Kemp Smith
Kemp Smith sometimes invited students to Sunday dinner followed by a country walk
They were not ordinary social occasions for the Scotsman did not speak of his own innocent child might cause him to speculate about the possibility of innate ideas
Edmund enjoyed his wit
Kemp Smith said that a professor of his acquaintance was driven out of the parish in disgrace by the congregation of the little Scotch country church in which he had been preaching because he said in one of his sermons that the weather was almost certainly not managed by Providence but probably the result of natural conditions This is a note in Wilson s journal
Although Kemp Smith apparently believed in God he remarked that if you were not persuaded of immortality you ought not to allow yourself to be convinced b y the death of a favorite daughter
It was what Edmund had told himself several years earlier when an aged preacher at Hill said that the boys would come to share his point of view when they were old enough
A serious thinker in the secularized Calvinist tradition of which Wilson too was a product Kemp Smith was intellectually the most impressive age as Gauss he was already a recognized authority on Descartes and in he was working on what remains the standard translation of Kant s Critique of Pure Reason
He would later expound the skepticism of Hume
His lectures were a systematic exploration of everything from the nature of man s knowledge of the external world to aesthetics
He knew enough literature to base an argument on Wordsworth and spoke of the personalities of Boswell and Hume as well as their ideas
He was also interested in science ideas and newsin everything that men were doing
Philosophy had always meant for him everything that men had thought
Such a man left his mark
He would not be a professional model for Wilson was never a theorist or system builder
He could admire Kemp Smith s mind while observing its paradoxical relationship to the everyday world as when in class the professor had just disproved the existence of sound when his lecture was interrupted by a brass band outside the windows
s view that one made the life significant out of personal effort
Wilson would keep in touch with these teachers
In Gauss he had found a second intellectual father and a sounding board
In the dedication to Axel s Castle he would acknowledge a debt to Gauss s lectures and endorse his view of criticism as the history of man s ideas and imaginings in the setting of the conditions which have shaped them
Wilson conceived of artists as antennae of the racemuch like Poundnegotiating new experiences and helping humanity to move ahead
Gauss would have subscribed to the idea
With Kemp Smith his relationship was similarly durable
They corresponded and though the philosopher went to Edinburgh to assume the chair of logic and metaphysics Wilson managed to visit from time to time even as late as 
Ten years later Kemp Smith wrote to his former student contrasting Santayana s muddled theorizing to the fascinating autobiographies that gave a key to his complex makeup observations The Historical Interpretation of Literature given at Princeton in Wilson cites Kemp Smith in support of the view that the critic s authority is ultimately personal l that his judgements rest on the emotional satisfaction that derives from the imposition of form on the pain and disorder of reality
Summing up his own aesthetic he writes This relief that brings the sense of power and with the sense of power joy is the positive emotion which tells us that we have encountered a firstrate piece of literature
The idealistic student cherished his vision of what Princeton might be although his friends generally considered it at odds with the realities
He saw himself not so much as a marginalized member of a minority as one of the majority for whom he spoke even as he attempted to direct their interests and tastes often against their own inclinations
To occupy this position within the institutional structure of the college was good practice for a lifetime effort to extend artistic and intellectual standards man in the street could be enlightened about Proust and Joyce about Marx and the revolutionary tradition about the Dead Sea Scrolls and the literature of the Civil War never deferring to the limitations of this common reader s vision
He would not assume an adversarial relationship to an antiintellectual culture as would most of the intellectual elite of postWorld War II America
His college years had given him a sense of continuity with the great writers of the past a belief that their work could be carried on and made new in his own time
His was a privileged education derived from a class that valued literature and art and had some leverage on public affairs
He would be able to make use of it outside the milieu in which he had grown up and was already committed to opening up to others the intellectual experiences that it made available to him
His last review in the Lit was an appreciation of the account of a man who had worked his way through college a In the army he looked back nostalgically to Princeton in his poems
After World War I however it seemed impossible to have sentimental emotions about any situation and Princeton faded for him during the twenties
The last class reunion he attended was a drunken affair in which he described in a New Republic piece about the disillusioning effects of the war on his generation
In the thirties when Wilson was attacking capitalism from the left all that remained of his youthful ideal was satire I too have faked the glamor of gray towers I to have sung the ease of sultry hours Clean woods wide playingfields smooth ponds Where clean boys train to sell their country s bonds
In a sense his relationship with Gauss had replaced the institutional tie and Gauss s death in severed Wilson s loyalties though he lived pleasantly off Nassau Street when giving the Gauss lectures two years later
In the modern technological Princeton his impression was that the was accentuated because the university never gave him any money something Wilson always needed The Princeton University Library Chronicle paid him fifty dollars for Thoughts on Being Bibliographed an essay as valuable in its own time as Emerson s American Scholar
When he resorted to selling his papers to pay overdue income tax it was Yale s Beinecke Library that bought them
He remained loyal to the literary friends with whom he set forth into the world even when they disappointed him
John Biggs a friend of Fitzgerald s who gave up realistic fiction to become a lawyer then a distinguished federal judge gave up too much in Wilson s eyes
When Dell failed to pursue literature when Bishop s writing still largely imitative failed to flower he attributed it to problems in their private livesBishop s marriage Dell s long analysis with Jung
He preached art to them for its own sake and as a way of dealing with their problems
Now is would write to Fitzgerald in when Scott s life was disintegrating and he was beginning to feel hopelessly inferior to the novelist whom he had helped on his way
Wilson s ambitions for others and proclivities as a cheerleader colored his conception of the role of a critic
That his talent was for interpretive expository writing made it easier for his creative energies to sustain themselves through all the confusions of his life while the energies of his novelist and poet friends faded
In old age Wilson once talked of an unwritten work perhaps in novel formhe thought he might not live to do itthat would consist of a round of visits among the blasted comrades of his youth
It is the language of the nineties the era that first set the image of the artist for this college generation
As a senior at Princeton Edmund concocted with Scott and John for a parody of the fin de siecle The Last Remains of Edward Moore Gresham
In making up the poet s sad and his literary remains he could never have imagined he would one day address to the dead Fitzgerald a poem beginning Scott your last fragments I arrange tonight
""
Wilson s loyalties reflected the cloistered nature of his college world
He neither smoked nor drank taking one glass of champagne at the yearly banquet of his club
In his class poll the future inveterate pursuer of women was named most likely bachelor
He sometimes hoped that his powers as a writer would win him the woman of his dreams
In a goodnatured letter to Bellinger in whom he continued to confide he imagined coming upon this marvelous creature in a moonlit scene in Venice reading my last novel
Wilson s reverie continues
How do you like the book It s pretty darn good is it not I blurt out
No she replies in a lovely voice It is the saddest stuff that ever I read
""
Even
The comedy continues
He reveals he is the authorexpecting her to express a better opinion of the novel immediately which she does nt
Looking to the sky for strength however she says Never mind I ll marry you just the same
""
In editing his journals he recalled an evening after graduation when Bishop Fitzgerald another friend and he were walking on Nassau Street and two women came by who it was explained were hookers a word he had not heard before
John and Alec went off with the girls while Scott and I took a walk down the hill to the lake
That s one thing exclaimed Scott that Fitzgerald s never done If Edmund was not bound by a Catholic conscienceeven such a porous one as Scott had claimedhe lacked his friend s confident charm
My feminine ideal at this time he wrote when looking back upon his journals was not the kind of girl those lovely and slender brunettes capable of serious interests for whom the heroes of HG Wells abandoned their passive wives
When I stayed in hotels I would dream of amours with complaisant chambermaids but I would not have had the least idea how to initiate one
""
As graduation approached he became impatient with the unreality of college life and experience familiar to American students
He had no idea how to support himself as his father had long been insisting he would have to do

I want to be one of the greatest writers who ever lived do nt you Fitzgerald remarked to him not long after they left college
It was an aspiration he could not share since as he said to himself Scott had been reading HG Wells and Compton Mackenzie when he had been reading Plato and Dante
Yet he had an ambitious conception of the future of their literary group one that would eventually embrace his literary generation
In he wrote in his journal Princeton was a kind of prelude before the action of the opera had begun when the leitmotifs which were to dominate the rest of the performance were quietly sounded as if in play

Edmund gratefully remembered that his father did not even smile at this nor venture any of the obvious objections that such a statement invited
That s a possible ambition he said

According to the Summary Report Doctorate Recipients from United States Universities published by the National Research Council new PhD
s were awarded in 
Fortyfour percent of those doctorates were in fields of science and engineering percent in the life sciences percent in the physical sciences and percent in engineering
Other large groups came from education percent and the social sciences percent
The humanities and professional fields business administration social work theology and others accounted for percent and percent respectively
While this distribution by fields held no surprises a special section on timetodegree highlighted some disturbing trends
First the median time spent in completing a PhD
has been rising steadily for twenty years to its present years including years of registered study
But the time required to proceed from a baccalaureate to a doctorate also varies significantly from field to field it takes appreciably longer years of registered time and the humanities years than in the sciences and engineering all of which fall well below the average engineering years physical sciences years and life sciences years
What do these figures mean and why should we care We should care warn leaders in education industry and government because the projected need for highly trained specialists in most of the specified fields can not be satisfied in the s by the current numbers of PhD
s which have been fairly stable for the past fifteen years
To meet increasing national and world requirements we must attract more students into our graduate schools and we must get them through more efficiently
What the figures mean however is another matter altogether one that can be explained more satisfactorily by history than by statistical analysis
At the beginning of this century many people in the United States were worried that there would be
In William James published an article deploring the increasing hold of the PhD
Octopus upon American life
James s powerful metaphor of the Octopus has long dominated discussions of the PhD
in the United States arousing archetypal images of a dark brooding presence strangling our students our campuses and indeed the intellectual life of the nation in its tentacles
The image may have occurred to James because in much of which he spent in England an unusual plague of octopi off the southern coast of England attracted a good deal of public attention
Forty years later in a reprise of James s piece in Teacher in America Jacques Barzun observed that James was inspired when he spoke of an octopus that describes its flabbiness its ubiquity and the squirting of ink which is its main reflex
According to Barzun nothing had changed since the turn of the century
The octopus has the young teacher in its grip and does mania has taken over the country yet Barzun claims After seeing degree holders and reading their theses it is hard to say what the title shows
In a thorough and judicious study Graduate Education in the United States Bernard Berelson stated that James was concerned lest The PhD
Octopus crush the true spirit of learning in the universities and quoted James s essay at length because his observations and comments reveal so well the timelessness of some issues of graduate study
To this day the PhD
Octopus is still invoked formulaically in discussions of graduate education and national life
James however had in mind no such broad target as PhD
mania or the true spirit of learning
He composed his essay with a very specific aim to call attention to misuse of the PhD
by what he labeled the DoctorMonopoly in teaching
Writing toward the end of the period when educational leaders like at Clark and Charles W Eliot at Harvard were striving to create the first major research universities in the United States he felt that the degree was in danger of being reduced to a mere advertising resource especially by the presidents and trustees of smaller institutions seeking to compensate for the lack of distinction in their faculties
Its most immediate effect was to keep many qualified but undoctored teachers out of our colleges
Will anyone pretend for a moment James asked that the doctor s degree is a guarantee that its possessor will be successful as a teacher
James was voicing a concern that troubled a good many educators around the turn of the century
Five years later James s Harvard colleague Irving Babbitt in Literature and the American College bemoaned the fetish worship of the doctor s degree on the part of certain college presidents
Babbitt believed that this acceptance of the doctor s degree as proof of fitness for a chair of literature to dehumanize literary study and fix on our colleges a philological despotism
At Princeton the dean of the graduate school himself Andrew Fleming West expressed his regret that the PhD
was becoming an employment badge like a union card in The Graduate College of Princeton 
The controversy about the value of a PhD
for a career in college teaching is therefore a classic one extending from James by way of Babbitt and West to Barzun and beyond down to today s disgruntled teaching assistant who looks around to see that he or she is doing most of the work of instruction at many universities while the highly paid professors who already have PhD
s are teaching only rarefied graduate seminars if teaching at all
To suggest the extent of the concern today a twoday walkout of teaching assistants on the Berkeley campus of the University of California in the spring of caused the cancellation of nearly percent of classes
""
For all James college teaching he an MD and scientist who had trained graduate students in physiology psychology and philosophy at Harvard among them G Stanley Hall and W E B Du Bois did not question the value of the PhD
as a degree certifying ability in research
Our higher degrees were instituted for the laudable purpose of stimulating scholarship especially in the form of original research
While he recognized the dangers of institutionalization on a large scale to develop a tyrannical Machine with unforeseen powers of exclusion and corruption he supported both the PhD
as a degree and the graduate school as an institution It is well for a country to have research in abundance and our graduate schools do but apply a normal psychological spur
""
But other factors are involved here
When James wrote his essay he was a tenured professor on the point of retirement following a distinguished career
He did not feel personally threatened by the research scholars with their PhD
abroad ill at ease with German scientific methods
It is no accident that many of the presidents who stimulated graduate education in this country were themselves scientists who had also studied in Germany the physical geographer Gilman the chemist Eliot and the psychologist Hall
From the very start the PhD
was largely a degree for scientists intended as the Yale faculty put it in to enable us to retain in this country many young men and especially students of science who now resort to German universities for advantages of study no greater than we are able to afford
The proportions of degrees awarded over the years show that this tactic was successful
By the physical and biological sciences accounted for more than half of the PhD
s awarded in the United States
The social sciences made haste to emulate the sciences through the quantification of their methods as did the humanities through a turn from appreciation to methodological and historical rigor
The scientists were positivistic training and research
The principal opponents of the PhD
were humanists whose work did not lend itself so smoothly to scientific methods
Babbitt still an untenured assistant professor with a master s degree when he published Literature and the American College felt distinctly menaced by the PhD
s with whom President Eliot was staffing Harvard s departments
Not content with James s pragmatic argument against the DoctorMonopoly in teaching Babbitt attacked the degree itself on the moral grounds that the work that leads to a doctor s degree is a constant temptation to sacrifice one s growth as a man to one s growth as a specialist
The classicist Andrew Fleming West less defensive than Babbitt although he also had no doctorate sought to combat what he regarded as the unenlightened specialization of the new breed by creating at Princeton his Graduate College a residence for a community of graduate students who living together would be infected by the contagion of knowledge
""
Babbitt was also afflicted by a rabid antiGermanism which led him to regard the PhD
as a German incubus to rail against German doctors and to claim that the uncritical adoption of German methods is one of the chief obstacles to a humanistic revival
Babbitt almost certainly did not realize that he was recapitulating a debate whose terms had been exhaustively explored by German thinkers ever since Schiller in his inaugural address at the University of Jena in made the classic distinction between Brotgelehrte the specialists who want to learn nothing that would distract them from the fields in which they intend to earn their living and the philosophical minds who see knowledge as a whole and integrate their particular interests into that unity
Babbitt went well beyond James in challenging the worth of the PhD
altogether and he has been followed by others who often unwittingly but nonetheless wrongly attribute that humanist disdain of the degree itself to James
In the realpolitik of like business administration agriculture home economics physical education and recreation it is naive to believe that what James called our three magic letters certify anything resembling the humanist notion of culture
Today American universities including the best ones award the PhD
to foreign students who can barely speak English to US students who can not understand a foreign language to humanists who have no grasp of mathematical or statistical or scientific reasoning and to scientists and engineers who can barely construct a coherent paragraph of English prose
Graduate schools can not aspire to compensate for the educational and cultural deficiencies that students have brought along from secondary schools and undergraduate colleges
The PhD
does not pretend to certify a command of the calculus or Latin or US history or French literature that a student should have obtained earlier in life
The role of the university as a cultural agent in our society has declined proportionately as the university has become less unified in its vision and its constituency and more of students from the most varied backgrounds and career interests
In such an educational system the PhD
can be no more but should also be no less than one welldefined step in the process leading from college through graduate school and into postdoctoral careers whether within the university or outside
What the PhD
does certify and usually quite creditably is a degree of competence regarding the organization and methods of a general field of study for example history or physics and a solid command of the chosen field of specialization for example German history of the sixteenth century or string theory
It is a matter of expectations you do not expect the holder of a new driver s license for passenger cars to be able to handle an ox cart or an eighteenwheeler
But you would reasonably expect him to understand the historical link between the ox cart and the automobile as well as the theoretical analogy between steering the passenger vehicle and the truck
However expertise in these road aircraft
Whether the recipient of a PhD
is a brilliant generalist or a tedious nerd is essentially irrelevant to the abilities certified by the graduate program with its degree
The same applies to the pedagogical qualifications of the doctorate
The newly certified PhD like his graduate school professor may be dazzling in the classroom or an unhappy tribulation for his students
Today many graduate students especially in the humanities and social sciences have too much not too little teaching experience by the time they receive their degrees unvaried unsupervised and poorly remunerated experience
But those abilities are not guaranteed by the degree
None of these characteristics stand in any necessary relationship to the other
The prodigiously learned generalist may be a prodigious bore while the specialist with no interests beyond the narrow bounds of his field may through his very obsession captivate his students
In sum the terms of the debate as established by James and Babbitt have become largely irrelevant to current discussions regarding are unimportant just that they are misplaced if addressed to the PhD
per se
As desirable as a wellrounded knowledge of one s field of specialization may be and as important as it is to have excellent teachers in college classrooms those problems can not be solved by the PhD
alone which exists as James well knew for related but distinctly different purposes
Discussion about reforms of the degree should take care not to discard what is good and distinctive about the PhD
by seeking to make it serve too many purposes
For better or worse the PhD
has increasingly been regarded as desirable by American society even in fields where such certification might be thought irrelevant such as music composition
I note one amusing exception I was recently petitioned unavailingly by a graduate student in physics to change the title of his Princeton degree from Doctor of Philosophy to Doctor of Science on the grounds that in the Soviet Union where he was born the Marxist trash forcibly hammered into every head
""
In James wrote that graduate schools still are something of a novelty and higher diplomas something of a rarity
In fact only PhD
s were awarded in the United States that year and according to the National Academy of Sciences survey A Century of Doctorates barely altogether had been bestowed since 
But the situation changed rapidly
The number of PhD
s has roughly doubled each decade in this century at a rate considerably more rapid than the population as a whole bringing the annual total today to the low thirty thousands where it has stabilized since the early s
It has been estimated that by half of one percent of the US population held a doctorate
The PhD
has not just multiplied it has also spread
Almost percent of the doctorates awarded in were concentrated in the fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities The PhD
s in were granted by some institutions
The dispersal of universities now awarding the degree is indicated by the fact that today even the top forty doctorategranting institutions beginning with the flagship campuses of the state universities of California Wisconsin Illinois Texas and Michigan accounted for not quite half of them
The PhD
Octopus is well and thriving
Indeed for the contemporary situation the generally small timid octopus which tends to confine itself mainly to coastal waters provides an image less compelling than another cephalopod the large aggressive and highly mobile squid with two prehensile arms in addition to its eight grasping tentacles
Today most colleges and universities still decorate their catalogues with titles which in James s words bespangle the page as if they were sprinkled over it from a pepper caster and it is not likely that their titular ambitions will wane
It would confirm James s worst fears to know that the widely consulted Peterson PhD
s on the faculty of each institution listed
Despite the huge increase in PhD
s the demand still outstrips the supply
The calamari to give the squid its gastronomic designation is regarded as a delicacy and not just in those exotic parts of the world that send their students in increasing numbers to pursue their graduate studies in our universities but also in the gourmet restaurants favored by the expenseaccount representatives of the nonacademic world that is bidding for larger and larger shares of the PhD
market
When James and Babbitt were writing they had in mind principally the effect that the influx of PhD
s would have on the American college as they knew it
But the PhD
is no longer primarily a teaching degree especially in the sciences and engineering
Only half of today s PhD
s are accepting academic employment as compared to almost percent just ten years ago
In according to the Summary Report percent of percent into government and more than percent into other sectors for example elementary and secondary schools nonprofit foundations selfemployment
The taste for squid is spreading to the extent that some of the rarer academic varieties are virtually being pursued with drift nets
As surveys by the American Council for Education have recently shown colleges and universities are already experiencing increasing difficulties in their efforts to identify and recruit faculty members especially in business computer science mathematics economics the natural sciences and the health professions
A major report by William G Bowen and Julie Ann Sosa Prospects for Faculty in the Arts Sciences projects an increasing discrepancy between the supply and the demand in many other disciplines in the coming decades
This shortage results from several factors
First despite what Bowen and Sosa identify as the striking flight from the arts and sciences during the seventies from percent of total degrees conferred in to only onequarter in and are expected to increase slightly in the s in response to the slackening interest in engineering among undergraduates the increasing emphasis on the liberal arts not only in liberal arts colleges but also at such technological institutions as MIT and the public concern with questions of ethics and values
Second Bowen and Sosa point out that the anticipated steady supply in the number of new PhD
s will not suffice to replenish faculty ranks although they demonstrate contrary to popular opinion that there will be no dramatic bunching of faculty retirements in the nineties and that the retirements will have varying effects in different fields and types of institution
In fact some universities are already beginning to stockpile PhD
s against that anticipated imbalance of supply and demand
Third the proportion of US citizens receiving American PhD
s has been declining from more than percent in to only percent in 
While many foreign students plan to remain in this strong competition for our PhD
s from abroad as other countries intensify their investments in science and technology
Finally the steady growth of big science in federal and industrial laboratories as well as in universities will absorb more and more highly trained researchers in such fields as superconductivity space exploration and medical research
Even though James s gentle octopus has metamorphosed itself into the largest invertebrate known to man the supply is still not adequate to meet the increasingly ravenous demand from institutions and nations competing among themselves for PhD
s
In the light of this problem the debate over specialization versus generalization or teaching versus research seems rather quaint
How has this situation developed Since the number of PhD
s awarded annually in the United States has more than tripled from to a total last year of 
That figure might suggest that students are entering graduate school in adequate numbers to meet the demand
But most of the growth had taken place by stopped because for a variety of reasons the demand for PhD
s both within and without the universities declined
Universities which had filled their ranks with new and young professors in the s in response to the matriculation of the babyboom generation realized that they had enough and in some fields too many teachers for the smaller birth cohorts reaching college age in the late seventies and eighties
In some fields specifically the oil and aerospace industries economic factors caused a decline in the demand for certain kinds of engineers and scientists
At the same time starting salaries in other fields began to reach such heights that college graduates accepted jobs immediately after school or entered more immediately gratifying twoyear MBA
programs with a quicker payoff
For these reasons and despite certain social achievements for example the proportion of women increased to its current percent of American graduate students the proportion of US men declined steadily
To keep the number of graduate students at the minimal level required researchintensive fields of science and engineering universities began recruiting widely abroad
As a result in only percent of the PhD
s in engineering were awarded to US citizens and only percent in the physical sciences
The current national graduate population of about million students might still seem to be an adequate pool in which ta cultivate squid
But most of those students are in professional or terminal master s programs
Far from all students who enter a doctoral program actually persevere to earn the degree
As many as percent of students who pass their general examinations fail for one reason or another to complete the degree
Attrition is notoriously difficult to measure because both the definition and the data are so vague
Did the student drop out or did he or she switch fields or institutions Did the student drop out for good or only long enough to earn some money or to have a child or to travel for purposes related to education Universities have reliable statistics on students required to fill out a national survey form
But those who never finish rarely pause to explain why they dropped out
Even if substantial numbers of these graduate students intended to stop with a master s degree or have made a happy transition into another subject or into a professional school there are still enough disenchanted ABD s All But Dissertation out there concentrated in places like Cambridge Morningside Heights Hyde Park Berkeley and other large academic communities but visible everywhere to have created a limbo of aging graduate students an unhappy intellectual proletariat with its own mystique
From time to time one sees on resumes the designation ABD as though it represented a degree actually received
The phenomenon of the ABD is by no means peculiar to the late twentieth century
Two hundred years ago Johann Wolfgang Goethe provided a precise model of the type
As a law student at the University of Strasbourg in Goethe as undisciplined as he was brilliant wasted his as the deadline approached hastily patched together a dissertation which was straightway rejected by his professors
On the basis of an oral examination he received a license to practice law but no doctorate
Of course a PhD
is not necessary for success in life as William James well knew Goethe went on to do quite nicely for himself acting among other capacities as minister for higher education in the duchy of SaxeWeimar
Moreover his revenge on the institution was sublime shortly after the rejection he wrote the sections of Faust in which the university and its practices are wickedly satirized by Mephistopheles posing as a professor
By what James called this new class of American social failures had begun to emerge in this country
His most poignant words are reserved for these persons whom he regarded as the institution s victims
Men without marked originality or native force but fond of truth and especially of books and study ambitious of reward and recognition poor position weak in the eyes of their examiners among these we find the veritable chair a canon of the wars of learning the unfit in the academic struggle for existence
Forty years later Barzun classified the species Instructors aged fortyfive and fifty are found treading the mill at the point where they began They find other posts good bad or indifferent but never forget the cruel Alma Mater that took their best years and made them start anew in midcareer
Circumstances have hardly improved
A few years ago a greeting card was circulating in university circles that featured a miserable creature with a hangdog expression under the inscription Meet the Bitterest Person in the World The Grad School Dropout
From time to time the New York Times and the Chronicle of Higher Education print letters or oped pieces in which disgruntled ABD s savage the institutions with which they have been unproductively associated for all too many years
Ultimately both the recruitment of talented new graduate students ominous third factor timetodegree
The squid is not just larger than the octopus it also has two arms that can reach out farther than the eight tentacles the better to hold on longer to the student once seized in its embrace
If any generalization about timetodegree is possible it is that it tends to increase
The Summary Report calculated that time to the PhD
has increased by about percent over the last twenty years
While timetodegree varies appreciably from field to field and while it can be measured in different ways either the total lapsed time between the baccalaureate and the doctorate what the statisticians call TTD or just the actual period of registered graduate study RTD the time spent in completing the PhD
has been rising steadily from years in to registered years in or from years in total time to years
Put another way the average graduate student is currently well over thirty actually years old and has spent the time he or she finally receives the degree that entitles him or her to begin any career that specifies the PhD
as its prerequisite
They are just entering the labor market at a point when many of their contemporaries in other professions are beginning to calculate their retirement benefits
This has not always been the case
William James may have turned his elegant irony on the PhD
as a prerequisite for college teaching but he did not question the time required to achieve it
In the example James cites at the beginning of his essay of the brilliant student of philosophy who had been working as a writer for three years and suddenly found that he needed a PhD
to take a position in English literature offered at a smaller institution the young man spent several weeks writing a thesis on metaphysics and reviewing his studies so as to pass our formidable ordeals
The committee could not accept the hastily assembled work brilliancy and originality by themselves wo nt save a thesis for the of learning
But unlike Goethe James s protege was urged to pad out the thesis properly and to resubmit it and within a year he was able to fulfill all the requirements for the degree
While the overall timetodegree was fairly lengthy since the years of freelance writing would have been counted the period of registered graduate study was quite short or in any case not significantly extended by the year needed to pad out an acceptable dissertation
James s example is representative for that period
When Yale decided in to offer the doctorate the requirements were simple at least two years of study on campus past the bachelor s degree a satisfactory final examination and a thesis giving evidence of high attainment
The first three American PhD
s were in due course awarded at Yale in after just two years of postbaccalaureate study
In the decades following the founding of the first American research university at Johns Hopkins in
Octopus the doctorate remained a shortterm degree normally requiring only two or at most three years of postgraduate study
These expectations were shared by the students
At the founding meeting of the Federation of Graduate Clubs in the representatives from various universities recommended that the minimum requirements for the PhD
should be two years of resident graduate study a general examination and a thesis
The establishment of national organizations beginning around led to efforts to standardize the degree
In the National Association of State Universities and in the Association of American Universities proposed that the period of postgraduate study should ideally be three years
The American conception of the PhD
has remained remarkably constant throughout most of the century
In the Association of Graduate Schools and the Council of Graduate Schools issued a joint statement summarizing their view of the normal course of study leading to the doctorate a year or two of lectures and seminars followed by a general examination and a dissertation
The entire or at most four years beyond the baccalaureate
The fouryear norm has been affirmed by most writers who have analyzed the situation for example Bernard Berelson in Graduate Education in the United States and Stephen H Spurr in Academic Degree Structures Innorative Approaches 
While most graduate deans have striven quixotically to maintain the ideal of the fouryear PhD reality has veered sharply away
Indeed Spurr calculated that only percent of graduate students in were completing their PhD
s within four years of the baccalaureate
The available evidence in a NRC survey Doctorate Production in United States Universities suggests that the average total timetodegree for the students receiving their PhD
s in was years and that by it had increased to years
The data show certain variations
Already in the pattern was evident that prevails today timetodegree was shortest in the physical sciences and the life sciences the fields in average in the social sciences and appreciably longer in the humanities
All fields showed a deviation downward from the trajectory during World War II probably as a result of accelerated wartime programs and again during the early s probably as a result of several vast postwar fellowship programs
During the s the total timetodegree fell slightly because support possibilities were very good and the war in Vietnam made it attractive for students to maintain continuous enrollment
Yet during that same period and probably for the same reasons the registered timetodegree increased steadily from years in to years in and without a break in the curve to years in 
The spectrum is identical with that in ranging from the shortest degree time in the physical sciences to the lengthiest in the humanities
""
Various factors have been cited to account for the lengthening timetodegree in our doctoral programs
In some fields engineering or business and management for example the candidate is often expected the real world before entering or completing a graduate program but the period of registered study is not seriously extended
Another factor cited for the statistical increase in timetodegree is the rise in the number of parttime students in graduate schools
Is it the case that fulltime students are finishing in the same time while the statistics are changed by the parttime students who take longer While I have no national data at Princeton timetodegree has been creeping gradually upward from years in to years in and years in even though the Graduate School admits only fulltime students and strives mightily to maintain a reasonable timetodegree
""
A third factor involves type of support
According to the Summary Report students with fellowships or research assistantships completed their degrees significantly faster than those who supported themselves with their own earnings or with family support or loans
But the report has no way of taking into account the fact that students may receive fellowships because they are judged to than those who receive no such award
The amount of time spent teaching is another factor that varies from field to field
While teaching assistants finished in years that is more slowly than those on fellowships and research assistantships but still well below the overall average in those fields where teaching is most common notably in the humanities students who teach require years to finish
But the question still remains do these students take longer to finish their work because they are teaching more or are they teaching more because they need longer to finish their work Especially in the sciences some professors also hold on to graduate students who have proved to be integral to a continuing research project
Finally despite all the myths about the misery of ABD status some graduate students seem to enjoy the way of life or at least prefer it to the uncertainties of the job market or the relegation to what they consider to be less desirable locations or institutions
The Germany along with the PhD
degree
All of these considerations are less important than changes in disciplinary expectations
Something can be done nationally and locally about graduate student support about parttime versus fulltime study about teaching demands about exploitation of research assistants and about other external factors
Disciplinary expectations on the other hand can be transformed only from within the individual departments
Changes here can have immediate results independent of such external factors as financial support or the job market
Compared to the undergraduate curriculum which is determined by the faculty as a whole and the institution s image of itself graduate curricula are set almost exclusively by individual departments according to the expectations of the discipline for example the need for competence in Latin or in statistics for archival research or the use of scientific equipment at distant locations
The graduate faculty as a whole may set certain minimal requirements for example at least one year of residence or a certain number of courses But the substance of the degree is determined almost wholly by the department
Here matters have changed little since the days of William James who noted among his colleagues two antagonistic passions one for multiplying as much as possible the annual output of doctors the other for raising the standard of difficulty in passing so that the PhD
of the special institution shall carry a higher blaze of distinction than it does elsewhere
These antagonistic passions manifest themselves today in pressures with which every graduate dean is familiar to increase the number of graduate students in every department while at the same time extending the expectations and the time for the degree
Higher expectations for degree candidates involve the material to be mastered in the early phase of graduate study with the result that the date of the general examination has been pushed subtly back in some departments especially in the humanities
But the very designation ABD suggests that the central problem is located mainly in the period following the doing research and writing the thesis
Sometimes attenuation is justified
In some fields timeconsuming fieldwork is a prerequisite for adequate professional training
The ecologist needs to be in Africa when the zebras are mating the plant biologist in South America when the trees are fruiting or the anthropologist in Sri Lanka long enough to win the confidence of the local population
In others the student needs to spend months in archives or museums or foreign libraries collecting material
But if the student has been thoughtfully advised and steered to a topic that is not unrealistically large or exotic then even that research away from campus should not require substantially more time than library and laboratory work on the home campus
It is not without significance that timetodegree almost precisely parallels the average length of dissertations by field
From to the present total timetodegree has consistently ranged from a low point in the physical sciences by way of engineering and the life sciences to the social sciences and professional fields with its peak in the based his study the length of dissertations accepted in by median number of pages extended from the physical sciences pages and life sciences pages by way of engineering pages and the professional fields pages to the social sciences pages and the humanities pages
There are of course many local variations
The often mammoth dissertations in history and political science more than pages are balanced by shorter ones in sociology and economics to produce an average in the social sciences that is slightly below the average in the humanities
Concerns about these problems have become so widespread that the Council of Graduate Schools in appointed a task force to study The Role and Nature of the Doctoral Dissertation
""
Bulk has not always been a prerequisite in humanities dissertations
When James Morris Whiton qualified for one of the first three Yale PhD
s in he submitted a sixpage handwritten thesis in Latin on that might strike today s ABD s as sadly prophetic
The young philosopher that James cites wrote his dissertation in only a few weeks although he needed another year to pad it out with scholarly apparatus
By Don Cameron Allen in a study on the PhD
in English and American literature estimated that percent of the dissertations in the field came to between and pages another percent ranged from to pages and percent amounted to pages or more
What s going on here
James and Babbitt were both right
The PhD as it was imported into the United States from Germany during the heyday of positivism was neither a teaching certificate as James pointed out nor a cachet of culture as Babbitt stressed
It was essentially a badge of research competence in the sciences introduced into this country by presidents who were Germantrained scientists and monitored for the past century by graduateschool deans who have come preponderantly from fields fiftyeight deans currently representing their institutions in the Association of Graduate Schools are scientists or engineers at many universities moreover the dean of the graduate school serves concurrently as dean or vicepresident or director of research
For this reason the worries about the degree have come principally from the humanists not from the scientists and engineers who have been generally quite content
Berelson reported that percent of physicists and percent of mathematicians described the current state of their discipline as very satisfactory as opposed to percent in history and percent in English
The level of satisfaction was lowest percent in the field with the longest average dissertations political science
""
Why should this be so Scientists and engineers generally have a keen sense of the state of the art a consensus regarding the problems that need to be addressed at any given time
Moreover they have been resourceful over the years in adapting the requirements of the PhD
to the needs and graduate student rapidly becomes affiliated with a group or a laboratory working on a specific problem the dissertation emerges from or as a component of the group s work
The professor often has a personal stake in seeing that piece of the project done competently and expeditiously otherwise it could delay or jeopardize the entire project
What most dissertations of this sort constitute to be sure is not an original piece of research but rather and perhaps more important a contribution to knowledge certifying the ability to carry out research according to the current standards of the discipline
Accordingly the dissertation is increasingly no longer a monograph in the traditional sense of the word but a presentation according to the publication practices in the field it often includes material already presented at conferences and published by the candidate and his or her research group
The PhD
thus earned does not attest the pedagogical abilities or the cultural sophistication or the emotional maturity of the candidate but it does and productively in research groups on other campuses or in nonacademic laboratories
Some social scientists and most humanists bring quite different expectations to the degree
Many regard graduate school not simply as the place to acquire a certain level of knowledge and proficiency in a field but as an openended status where the aspiring PhD
can sit and mellow like a wine ripen like a cheese and grow like a vegetable the organic metaphors flourish in the prose of departments seeking more time and support for their students
These expectations were explicit in Irving Babbitt s opposition of Germanic specialization to the more humane growth as a man
But they are still all too often implicit today in the expectations of departments interviewing candidates for their positions
How often is the gifted scholar who has worked hard to complete the degree in a reasonably short time passed over for the more mature candidate who has acquired years four hundred pages In the sciences new PhD
s are expected to mature in the postdoctoral positions that have there become the norm
But in the humanities and some of the social sciences this process of maturation is increasingly calculated into the degree expectations
They not only want squid they want mature squid whose plumpness has been induced by hormones The correlation between timetodegree and dissertation length makes the skeptical dean sometimes suspect that the dissertation is long because the ripening time needs to be filled out and not viceversa
To look at it another way American humanists and social scientists are increasingly making the same demands upon the PhD
that are fulfilled in Germany by the postdoctoral Habilitationsschrift or in France by the these detat that is a major piece of postdoctoral research carried out by a candidate who is already employed as a teacher
Instead of regarding the degree as the beginning of a career as the certification that the degree holder is now ready to enter the first level many colleges and universities choose to regard it as proof that the wellripened recipient has dutifully churned out four hundred pages of carefully documented though often dull prose published several forgettable papers and taught the same elementary courses many times over
These wellcured PhD
s in turn place a burden on the system by occupying the places and the support that might otherwise be given to new candidates
If universities do not succeed in getting them through the system more quickly then they shall surely be unable to meet the demands of the nineties
What can be done In the first place as James suggested as early as universities might lower their fantastic standards by scaling the PhD
in the humanities and social sciences back to what it was originally intended to be and what it still is in many of the sciences and in engineering not a Habilitation but simply as James put it a diploma certifying mastery and marking a barrier successfully in the preliminary phases as in the dissertation
But here much could be improved
Professors should discourage students from undertaking topics that are not reasonable in scope
The student who boasted in the New York Times of August that he had spent eight years merely identifying a thesis topic was either irresponsibly advised or an unregenerate ewiger Student
Departmental committees should monitor every stage of the process and make sure that the candidate understands the expectation that a reasonable topic can be managed in two or at most three years
The graduate schools in turn can establish procedures that make it increasingly difficult for students to submit their dissertations if too much time has elapsed
Studies of dissertation length and timetodegree suggest that universities should impose a strict upper limit on theses and refuse to accept those that are too long
This would teach students early in their careers about the realities of publication deadlines and length restrictions
Excessive length is sometimes an indication of course of the
Length requirements might also ensure that the dissertation will receive a more conscientious reading than is now often the case when lengthy tomes are returned to the student without a mark on their pages and with the most cursory of reader s reports
All the studies have shown that few factors affect rapid completion of the PhD
as powerfully as a close and encouraging relationship between student and adviser a relationship that thrives much less easily in the lonely library disciplines than in the more convivial laboratory sciences
The dissertation must continue to be the center of doctoral education
For many PhD
s it will remain the single extended piece of research and writing they will ever do
Even if the dissertation has not made a contribution to knowledge it has made a contribution to the candidate s own knowledge it should have taught him or her to identify and analyze a reasonable problem in the field to treat it according to accepted procedures and to present it in an accessible an exercise should prepare the new PhD
to organize his or her first college course and to appreciate what it takes to write a good book
A valuable byproduct of this change might be the disappearance of the vanity presses and the series that exist simply to publish with a heavy subsidy and at expensive prices the poorly edited and usually critically ignored dissertations currently being churned out by the system
""
The humanities might also emulate the sciences and such social sciences as economics in their tendency to accommodate the thesis to the current practices of the field
This is not to suggest approval of the practice in some fields of accepting as dissertations works that amount to published articles bound or stapled together
At many institutions the locally approved manual of style has become so dominant and so tyrannically enforced that the candidate comes away with the notion that style matters more than substance
A dissertation should present research results in the format appropriate to the discipline
Why should a student spend hours Many a new PhD
revising a dissertation for publication has discovered that the first things that must go are the introductory survey of research the lengthy footnotes and the cumbersome bibliographical apparatus often required for the dissertation
It would be far more helpful to the student s career as a scholar to learn the style used most widely in journals of the field to practice the art of selective quotation and to recite the credo of scholarly ethics
The dissertation should demonstrate the student s command of the basic skills of the discipline
Whether or not the PhD
then goes on to use those skills is another matter altogether one that depends on personal energy ambition and a variety of other factors
The degree should be awarded like the doctorate bestowed upon that promising but lazy student in seventeenthcentury Avignon recalled by Jacob Viner sub spe futuri studii
None of these changes can take place until the hiring departments modify what literary critics call their horizon of expectations and here the entire weight drags heavily on the present
If the expectations do not change the system will produce more and more ABD s and an inadequate number of PhD
s for the future
Departments should be seeking neither the scholar who has ripened long enough in graduate school to have compiled a fivehundredpage and therefore probably poorly supervised dissertation nor the scholar who has matured long enough to have acquired years of teaching or research experience and therefore probably a corresponding sense of bitterness at having been exploited by the graduate institution
Departments should instead be happy to appoint welltrained young PhD
s who have demonstrated their commitment by moving expeditiously through a reasonable program to a degree that certifies their competence to begin a career in teaching and scholarship
Let the hiring department participate in the continuing education of new PhD
s as is the case in many of the sciences by supervising their development as teachers and scholars
If that happens PhD
shortages in the s in the and engineering the problems are different they are not timetodegree or even attrition but rather recruitment into graduate programs of US citizens adequately motivated and prepared in mathematics and basic science
But that is a problem that reaches back beyond the graduate schools into colleges secondary schools and society itself
Indeed the educational deficiencies of American students have emerged as a national scandal that teas concerned blueribbon panels and caught the editorial attention of the national journals
Why should one care about issues that might seem to be the proper and rather specialized concern of the graduate schools First more than half of our PhD
s are no longer remaining in the academic cycle but are going into government industry and other sectors of our society
The worldwide need for specialists qualified to the level of PhD
is going to increase in the coming decade
In a certain sense our national future depends on the graduate schools
But it is also in the urgent interest of the nation at large to excellence in every field from Assyriology to astrophysics and train them within a reasonable time to assume an appropriate place in a college or university
If universities continue to permit or require students to spend ever longer portions of the most productive period of their lives in graduate school then the students entering graduate school this year will not yet be finished by the time of the excess demand predicted for the years 
Education can follow either an exhilarating trajectory or a vicious circle
If we do not have the best students with the finest minds in our universities the institution itself can rapidly decline as it did in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when the brightest thinkers preferred to be associated with academies that is the counterpart of today s nonteaching research institutes rather than with the universities
The principle of gravity and Gresham s law both provide analogies for intellectual history
Water seeks the lowest level bad money drives out the good secondrate scholars do nt like competition either among not succeed in attracting excellent students into graduate programs in the sciences and engineering and seeing them through to the PhD
within a reasonable time in the humanities and social sciences undergraduates in the nineties and the first decades of the new millennium will be taught in a dizzying downward spiral by second and thirdrate PhD
s and that giant PhD

By THEODORE ZIOLKOWSKI
THEODORE ZIOLKOWSKI professor of comparative lieterature and dean of the graduate school at Princeton University is the author of among other books Fictional Transfigurations of Jesus Varieties of Literary Thematics and German Romanticism and Its Institutions
I must begin by saying this In preparation for this lecture I read or in some cases reread a number of the writings of Sidney Hook
I read them solely to give me the right starting point for a lecture given in honor of Sidney Hook
But instead I found myself infused with a set of ideas that were relevant to a different setting a different occasion
Sidney Hook gave the Jefferson Lectures in which were published in under the tide The Paradoxes of Freedom
He also wrote an introduction to a Mentor Book of Thomas Paine s writings He wrote many other things as well
But as I read these two pieces it suddenly became apparent to me how relevant Sidney Hook s ideas are not only to this convention s activities but also to a question different fromthough related to those we examine here today
Next week I will participate in a meeting in Warsaw a meeting attended by a select set of members of constitutional reform
The questions they will be raising are questions that confront any new nation questions that confronted Jefferson and Paine How do we construct a new constitution What should the constitution look like
It was with these questions in the back of my mind certainly not in the front that I read Sidney Hook s writings about Paine about Jefferson and about liberty
I plan to carry his ideas with me to Warsaw next week
Two years ago I received an award from the Sociology of Education section of the American Sociological Association
I took the occasion to remind the sociologists present that the person to whom they were making the award had earlier been harassed vilified and attacked by officers of the association as well as by other social scientists for precisely the same research that was now the cause of an award 
I used the incidents surrounding that research to suggest that among the threats to academic freedom the threat posed by fellow faculty members is probably administrators of universities
I argued that the greatest enemies of academic freedom in the university are the norms that exist about what kinds of questions may be raised in research and in teaching as well although that was not my topic of interest and what kinds of questions may not be raised
There are taboos on certain topics taboos which if broken lead to sanctions not primarily from administrators or the general public but from one s own colleagues
It was not always so
The research and writing of professors were once far more subject to the norms of the larger community than they are today
At the University of Chicago for example a distinguished sociologist W I Thomas was spied upon harassed and finally driven out of the university by a newspaper whose publisher regarded Thomas s research on prostitution to be a violation of community mores
""
The taboos that a sociologist is most likely to encounter are those concerning questions of differences between genders or differences between races the social factors leading to homosexuality that begins with the premise that homosexuality is less natural than heterosexuality would be under a similar taboo
And there are other topics with taboos less strong
What interests and concerns me is the defining characteristic of these taboos and how they are held in place
For it is these taboos on the raising of certain questions the gentleman s agreement that certain questions remain unexamined that constitute one major threat to academic freedom in universities and colleges
What is more it is a threat that operates not merely through pressures from colleagues but also through selfsuppression
It is this phenomenon of selfsuppression that I want to focus on today
I will do so by recounting an incident one I had long put out of mind until I was reminded of it recently by a research proposal of one of my students a Hispanic student of the sociology of education
In the proposal a welldesigned study of the interaction between elementary school students and teachers my student pointed the proportion of minority students and the proportion of minority teachers
The student raised the question often raised concerning black students with white teachers but here concerning Hispanic students with nonHispanic teachers of whether the cultural difference might contribute to the educational disadvantage experienced by Hispanic students in American schools
This is a reasonable question but it reminded me of another I once failed to ask in research on inequality
of educational opportunity
The occasion was this In under a provision of the Civil Rights Act of the United States Office of Education as it was then called was carrying out a survey of the lack of equality of education by race and I was directing the study on parttime loan from Johns Hopkins University
The research arrived at some results we had not expected of which three were most important
First we discovered that the facilities and resources of schools attended by black and white children in the same region and urbanrural setting differed very little the principal settings not between races within these settings
This did lead to inequalities of resources and facilities by race but only through their different distributions across the country
Second we found that even if the resource distribution had been different it would not have mattered very much differential effectiveness of different schools was not closely related to the resources put into the schools by school boards nor to per pupil expenditure age of textbooks or a host of other measures of presumed school quality
To understand how this second result could be so how the outputs of education could be unrelated to the school inputs it is only necessary to shift the context
In the industries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union which like American public schools operate under state management free from the market discipline created by consumer choice outputs also have very little relation to inputs
In such systems the forces that would bring this about are largely missing
On the other hand there was one student achievement than others
Teachers were given a short vocabulary test in the survey and we found that the teachers scores on vocabulary tests were related to the verbal achievement of students in the school
Other characteristics of teachers were not including degrees experience and salary but vocabulary test score was related
The third result of the research was that black children achieved more highly in schools with student bodies that were predominantly middleclass
Although the official school resources mattered little for their achievement the resources provided by what fellow students brought to school did make a difference not as much as their own family backgrounds but more than the school board s resources
These results had various consequences
The first two were strongly opposed within the Department of Health Education and Welfare for they went against conventional wisdom as well as the recentlyinitiated federal policy of funding school physical facilities
The third result was used by plaintiffs in school desegregation cases including the citywide busing cases that were one result about which little was said
It is the result to which I now want to return the relation of teachers vocabulary scores to student achievement
One of the policy issues that was current at the time a necessary accompaniment of school desegregation was the future of black teachers as the formerly segregated school systems of the South were dismantled
These teachers were at a disadvantage because of the strong prejudice held by many Southern whites against having their children taught by black teachers
But they were also at another disadvantage themselves products of segregated school systems they were on the whole less prepared and qualified with lower verbal skills than their white counterparts
What does this mean for the research The question we did not ask was one directly connected to our research finding that children s verbal achievement in school was related to the vocabulary test scores of the teachers in the school
This finding taken together with the fact that black teachers were generally not as wellprepared as white teachers leads of the fate of black teachers from formerly segregated school systems How is the achievement of black children related to the racial composition of the teaching staff in the school
These two facts would also lead to the conjecture that black children would be doing less well on average under black teachers than under white teachers
In contrast the rolemodeling or cultural difference hypothesis that is implicit in my Hispanic student s research proposal would lead to the opposite conjecture that they would be doing better on average under black teachers
But if the first conjecture were right it would have some disturbing implications
One would be that a major source of inequality of educational opportunity for black students was the fact that they were being taught by black teachers
Another directly relevant to the policy issue would be that both black and white children would have greater educational opportunity if they were not taught by these teachers
It is this potential implication I suggest that was the cause of our not had found
Perhaps it was not this
We had many other things to keep us busy many other bartles to fight with agency officials who did not like our results many problems in merely maintaining the integrity of the research report in the face of attempts to rewrite or to undermine it altogether
Yet I believe that a dispassionate researcher concerned with finding facts relevant to the policy issues at hand one of which was school staff desegregation would have gone on to pose the question we did not ask
One could well argue that by not asking it we aided in the sacrifice of educational opportunity for many children most of whom were black to protect the careers of black teachers
And one could argue that by not asking it we encouraged the continued neglect of the kind of skillspecific retraining programs not only for black teachers but for all teachers that might have brought improvements in educational outcomes
But my principal concern here is not this policy issue
It of a research question the impulse not to ask the crucial question an impulse if I am correct that prevents many relevant research questions from being raised
These questions are not generally of the kind that are clearly taboo among university researchers yet they are nonetheless subject to more subtle pressures leading to the selfsuppression of research
How do these subtle pressures arise I believe it can be put this way
We hesitate to ask research questions which might lead to results that would elicit disapproval by those colleagues we see regularly
We monitor our own activities and suppress those that do not meet this criterion
When there is a strong consensus among these colleagues we redirect our behavior accordingly
The stakes are not trivial
I think of a sociologist who during the fervor of the s asked the wrong questions and came out with answers inimical to the school desegregation policies favored by his fellow sociologists and subsequently failed to get tenure
I know also from personal experience on similar the kinds of results that most strongly elicit disapproval by one s colleagues in universities The answer is not always and everywhere the same but I believe that for many academics in many settings the following can be said There are certain policies certain public activities that have the property that they stem from benevolent intentions expressed toward those less fortunate or in some way oppressed
The intended consequences follow transparently from the policy
These are policies designed to aid the poor or to aid blacks or Hispanics or women and any result that would hinder one of these policies is subject to disapproval and attack
These are policies intended to display egalitarian intentions
For many academics they replace the patterns of conspicuous consumption that Thorsten Veblen attributed to the rich
They might be called policies of conspicuous benevolence
They display conspicuously the benevolent intentions of their supporters
The consensus about such policies among academics stems if I am not mistaken from a general view that there is a single broad good intentions who want to help the disadvantaged and those who are selfish and opposed to any aid to those less fortunate
This view manifests itself in a thousand ways
It was the source of widespread support for communism among intellectuals in the s and s
It is the source of widespread support for sanctions against South Africa today for civil rights measures for school busing policies for generous welfare provisions for bills to aid the handicapped for the Equal Rights Amendment
Sometimes the support is wellplaced
Sometimes it is not
The conflict between this conspicuous benevolence and dispassionate research on the consequences of social policy lies in the difference between intentions and consequences
A former teacher of mine Robert K Merton has pointed out that because the indirect consequences of social action may be very different from its intended consequences much of sociology consists of examining the unintended consequences of purposive action The policies of conspicuous benevolence are not unfortunately immune to this principle that intentions do not equal are intended to help
But so long as there is a consensus among academics on the policies of conspicuous benevolence selfsuppression will prevent their serious questioning
How may that consensus be opposed or undone The problem is a fundamental one because a university is a community and a department is a community within that community
It is within such communities that norms grow and thrive
A norm about what is the correct thing to teach and what is the correct research to carry out constitutes an assumption by the community of the right to disapprove or otherwise sanction a member on the basis of his research or teaching
Members of that community feel an obligation one that sometimes leads to the selfsuppression I have described earlier to accede to such community rights
In a different context Sidney Hook wrote about this recognizing the close connection between community and rights accompanied by obligation
In the first of his lectures published as The Paradoxes of Freedom he says
obligation is purpose needsome shared interest want or feeling requires the functioning presence of these rights
Without some common nature or some community of feeling the sense of obligation could hardly develop the assertion of rights would have no binding or driving emotional force 
As Sidney Hook wrote community generates rights rights generate obligation and it is this obligation that leads in the case under question to the selfsuppression of academic freedom
Yet there is a way out
There are hierarchies of shared values in a community and therefore hierarchies of rights
If in the hierarchy of values held by the academic community of which one is a part the value of freedom of inquiry is higher than the value of equality the value that gives rise to conspicuous benevolence then such constraints such selfsuppression of research into inconvenient questions will no longer be effective
It is this I submit which is lacking in many university settings
If it were present the of obligation it entailed would lead to the pursuit of inconvenient questions without constraint
In the absence of such a hierarchy of values with freedom of inquiry above equality the most efficacious means to insure that inconvenient questions are pursued may lie in the creation of a community within the university that can insulate its members from the effects of the general pressure toward conspicuous benevolence
The creation of such a community cutting across universities an invisible college spanning the academic community as a whole may constitute another means
In this second alternative lies the importance of the insulation provided by an association like the National Association of Scholars
Again I am honored to be the recipient of the first Sidney Hook Memorial Award of the National Association of Scholars
Were he here today he would be pleased with the activities that carry on his fight for academic freedom
I would like to think I am best known for my wisdom and learning but in truth such fame as I have derives from my being a reputed conservative who is also dean of Yale College
That was the reason news of my appointment appeared in the Wall Street Journal and the National Review which does nt usually happen to deans of Yale College and does nt help them much when it does
What had I done to be considered so unusual It seems I had a very dark record at Yale
Back in William Shockley was prevented from speaking at Yale after arriving at a lecture hall complete with audience
Nothing like that had happened in memory and it was a pretty bad moment for us
I took it upon myself to make a public address in which I traced Yale s failure over the preceding decade to protect freedom of speech
As it turned out this talk had a certain effect
It resulted in the appointment of a commission chaired by produced a report on the importance of freedom of speech at universities the recommendations of which were adopted by the Yale Corporation and are now part of the Yale code of law
In any case during the course of that speech I made it very clear that the then president of Yale was a major reason for the failure to protect freedom of speech
A short while later Yale faced the scandal of a brilliant teacher and outstanding scholar one of the best in his field I would say being denied tenure by his department
I found this so outrageous and so plainly the consequence of illegitimate considerations and improper procedures that I publicly denounced the action thus provoking a Yale Daily News headline along the lines of Kagan Calls Committee s Report Whitewash which indeed was a correct report of my remarks
That incident was also relatively unprecedented at Yale
Finally when a group of students erected shanties on a key part of the Yale campus to protest is supposed to consider rule violations took no action against them I stepped forward before those structures and made a speech to object
Thus when some years later the president appointed me to the position of dean of Yale College all of these events were a part of my record
That provoked a certain amount of comment and I am told that a chill of fear ran through some segments of the faculty
The Yale Daily News sought opinions from various faculty members
One harkening back to my remarks about the shanties and my complaints that the people who had violated our rules had not been punished declared that this was evidence of a frightening intolerance on my part
Further since I had been and continued to be known to favor what I call common studies or a core curriculum another faculty member said my appointment was very dangerous because I believed some things were more important than others
But to get a real sense of the way my appointment News editorial entitled An Unsettling Choice Experienced Kagan Has Much to Prove
In Donald Kagan President Schmidt has chosen as Dean of Yale College a respected professor and experienced administrator
He also has sent what could be perceived as a dangerous message to this community
That Kagan is qualified to be a dean is clear
As chairman of a committee which in recommended changes in the structure of student government at Yale and as acting athletic director from Kagan has proven administrative experience
Students in Kagan s classics course extol his teaching style and ability some say that no one should leave Yale without having taken his class
Despite Kagan s personal achievements his appointment as the top officer of Yale College has justifiably alarmed some students and faculty
Kagan is a white male professor of history and classics who in the past has espoused decidedly conservative political and academic views
During the presidential search for a new dean the names of at least two women and one emerged as likely contenders for the position
Given that the process engendered hope much of it in these pages that a progressive candidate might be named to the post Kagan s appointment suggests to many in this community that Schmidt plans to continue his administration s conservative course
Several of Kagan s professed views give cause for worry about the next five years at Yale
In a letter to the News last year Kagan criticized students at Yale football games saying They chant slogans in foul and obscene language that is heard by women and children and families nearby some of them families of the players who are unaccustomed to contemporary student mores
Such a remark at best demonstrates an outdated paternalism at worst it offends proponents of free speech and equality of the sexes alike
Students are not the only members of this community disturbed by Kagan s appointment however
At a time when Yale is nurturing a number of innovative academic departments specifically those in area Kagan s devotion to the traditional liberal arts canon could impede further curricular progress and experimentation
In light of the probable pessimism with which many in this community will greet Kagan s appointment the new dean must act quickly and decisively to prove his detractors wrong
After four years of a dean perceived by most undergraduates as unresponsive to their concerns and uninterested in discussing their points of view Kagan s most pressing and difficult task will be to restore student faith in the position
He should take several measures to do so
Over the next few weeks Kagan should call a wide range of students to his office simply to talk with them
Not only will such meetings give the dean insight into students attitudes but they will assure students that the new dean is truly interested in actively soliciting their opinions
Periodic attendance at Yale College Council the student government meetings also would allow Kagan to learn firsthand of the issues most concerning students
Over the years Kagan has he must demonstrate as forcefully that he can accommodate the interests of a diverse and for now worried community 
Well I did nt do what was suggested needless to say
But it is evident how problematic my appointment was
Now what I find terribly worrisome is not the notion of everyone trembling at the appointment of a character like me which is really very funny but that it was considered acceptable to suggest there is something inherently alarming or worrisome about appointing a white male historian and classicist who has been known to utter conservative views about politics and academic matters
Just think what would happen if somebody had written the same thing about a black female professor who had been known to utter liberal views on these issues
I can just imagine the outrage and the claims of censorship
But the insinuations of this editorial are regarded as perfectly acceptable
I happen to know the kid who wrote it
He is very nice and had no another student wrote a letter in response pointing out how outrageous it really was
All this tells us something about what a strange situation we live in
What then can one conclude about my future prospects as dean I do nt know yet but at least I can report that a year has gone by and I m still in office
I was not sure that was going to happen
Of course I wo nt predict how long I ll remain because I ca nt say what will turn out to be possible
On the other hand I should say that it has nt been a bad time I have about as much hair as last year and it s not any grayer it ca nt be
Moreover I think I ve had a few small achievements and maybe there s some hope in that
However let me now address some of the questions that concern not just me but all of us and see if what I clues for reform
First let us consider the question of the curriculum
Yale has no common core of studies
I have on many occasions complained about this and explained the nature of the deficiency caused by the absence of such a program a fact which more than anything else has terrified people
I have said it before I m saying it now and I will say it again in the future I have no intention of trying to introduce such a program at Yale
It would be one of the most foolish things I could do
For one reason there s not the smallest chance the faculty would approve it as a general requirement but that s the least serious problem
It would be far more terrible if the faculty did approve it
Consider what a core constructed by the current faculty would look like and the consequences that would ensue if they also had the responsibility of teaching it
At a research university such as Yale the faculty has been trained to they are very uncomfortable in reaching out the way teachers of the liberal arts have traditionally been asked to do
So I have no such plans to force a formal core curriculum on the college as a whole
However the idea of having interested faculty members voluntarily put together a set of courses that covers certain core texts is something else
Nobody could stop us from doing that and I think we could probably do more good that way than by fighting a losing battle for a formal core
Unfortunately I think the number of people who might involve themselves in such an effort would be small
Second as to the question of discrimination we must begin by recognizing that it is a critical one and very properly related to the question of excellence
It is possible at Yale I believe to make the case for excellence and one of the reasons I accepted my highly problematic assignment was that I wished to create a greater degree of freedom of expression on precisely this subject
the same things I always had been saying but said them as dean of Yale College and if I survived that experience for any period of time it would make it easier for others to do the same
So I have continued to say these things and while people are nt necessarily persuaded by them they do pay more attention than they used to
What s more my sense is that these ideas do now seem to be less outrageous
But again that s only a preliminary report
I m much attracted by the notion of talking about the specific things that can be done to make a difference and I have a strategic suggestion which I think might be very important
One of the things I ve tried to do in the short time I ve been dean is to support foster and extend the study of the natural sciences at Yale
Now heaven knows simply for balance Yale needs that more than most places because we re so topheavy in that
In my judgment the natural sciences are the healthiest of the disciplines taught at our universities
I do nt know a single natural scientist who does not believe in the efficacy of reason or the possibility of truth arrived at through reason
On the other hand the woods are full of humanists who doubt those things
Therefore increasing the number and percentage of your faculty who believe in reason and truth is inherently a good thing
Secondly supporting and allowing them to feel they are an important maybe the most important part of your operation is also good
The one other thing that you must do however is to make them understand the issues that they normally ignore those that shape the parts of the university they tend to regard with distant amusement
After all people in the humanities do nt experiment do nt have controls disagree about what s good and bad and overall seem a very funny bunch of guys
So you have to humanities and why it matters to them enormously
What s more you have to involve them in the total life of the institution and ask their help in defending reason and the search for truth
And if you do my experience is that they will respond
And boy do we need em
We really do
And this is true quite apart from the intrinsic value of increasing the understanding knowledge and practice of science in the world today
Consequently as a strategic suggestion I would urge you to reach out to your scientific colleagues and ask them to help in the common cause
You will find that they ll be especially good in the area that I regard as central the main weapon that we have in this fight our insistence on high standards of intellectual achievement
Such an insistence is something scientists understand automatically it does nt have to be explained to them in any way
And that s where you can hold the line
At of underlying support for high achievement particularly among the students
One of the happiest experiences I ve had this year has been to participate in bestowing some of the traditional prizes given out to students at commencement time
Yale is wonderfully oldfashioned and many of these prizes probably go back to the eighteenth century
For example they give a prize for the student with the highest standing objectively arrived at in each of the divisions
And there s also a prize for the student who is thought to be somehow the very best a more subjective judgment but also based on all kinds of objective data
Now as dean of Yale College I made those awards this year and it was wonderful the way the class received them warmly enthusiastically encouragingly with not the slightest embarrassment at this singling out of people even within an already elite oligarchic group for greater elitism than ordinary
It was really a beautiful sight
And it tells you that if you can take the sting its remarkable desirable condition people will respond very positively
What seems so often true is that the things we deplore that seem to us so injurious to the quality and functioning of our institutions are in fact things that degrade or detract from excellence
But it is also important to note that the people doing the most damage at our institutions rarely say Yeah we do nt care about excellence
We want to get equality
We do nt care if they re excellent or not
What they say instead is We re for equality and we re for excellence
And so you have a weapon because there is obviously some contradiction there
The best way of holding to excellence is to be very careful and selective in the people you bring forward into positions of leadership
If in making these selections you choose faculty members who are themselves excellent and appreciate and insist on excellence you will discover that amazing things can happen
For example which have nt been applied for a very long time can again be enforced and that people will respond to them not always positively and often with some muttering about where they ll be next year but nonetheless with genuine acceptance
Finally with respect to the question of diversity we should reflect on the fact that while it presents a very serious problem it is one quite different from that typically imagined
We are all familiar with the demand for diversity of representation one from each color and continent and so on but what about the diversity of ideas To me this seems to be the most dreadful problem we face today
I think that most people who teach subjects in which ideas are central
as opposed to knowledge and technique are stunningly similar to one another
The degree of difference of opinion on my faculty is so slight as to be very troubling
When I began teaching the common wisdom was that our students had in outlook
That was a wonderful thing because it forced students to test their inherited ideas against our challenge
The result was conflict confusion turmoil and thought out of which could come either strengthened belief in inherited values or a change of mind based on better argument or better beliefs
When I look at the university today however I see that the situation has changed sharply
The students come to Yale mainly with what might be described vaguely as liberal beliefs
I hate to use that word because it s not true
Liberal ought to have something to do with liberty and what is generally called liberal these days has very litre to do with that
But you understand the code that I m using
And we on the faculty for the most part hold even more liberal beliefs than our students
Accordingly the result is not conflict but mutual massage of an imperfect and unprofessional kind
Now that s not education need to have greater differences of opinion
It s not necessary of course that the faculty and student body be completely at odds with one another or that there be some particular ratio of dissent
In fact only five or ten outstanding teachers on a faculty of five hundred can be enough to provide the required challenge if they re good and in the right subjects
That was my experience when I was a young assistant professor at Cornell
There were perhaps five or ten such people and the result was astonishing
I took it for granted because it was my first real position
Later on I discovered it was extraordinary and very nearly impossible to find today
Now is there anything that can be done about this My own experience is that very few cases exist in which there is active discrimination against people who have let us say conservative views
It almost never gets to that
What happens instead is that the number of people with such views for the best positions is terribly small
Hence in looking for intellectual diversity you find yourself in a position where you ca nt beat somebody with nobody
I can tell you that at Yale we ve been looking closely and carefully at departmental searches to ensure that no discrimination goes on but by itself this gives little prospect of solving the problem
So what we have is a deepseated difficulty that is going to be very hard to overcome

Section ISSUES
When Allan Bloom wrote The Closing of the American Mind he was probably not thinking of the closed mind under the image of a contraceptive
Still less would anyone be likely to think of the open mind that way
But such was precisely the image that seemed to govern a series of events at Princeton University this past year which culminated in the dismissal of one of the official Catholic chaplains 
C John McCloskey is a young priest who belongs to Opus Dei the Work of God a mixed layclerical organization founded in Spain in the s with branches throughout the Catholic world
Opus Dei prides itself on its loyalty to the pope and its rigorous spiritual discipline
Some of its members were active in the Franco government in Spain and the group has often been accused of having a conservative political ideology
Officially Opus Dei states that it has no political position as such but that its members are free to engage in political activity Opus Dei members are known to be politically active
The group has for years been in the habit of establishing houses near elite universities and seems to recruit new members primarily from such environments
There are degrees of affiliation some of which are relatively loose
The group was active at Princeton as early as and in it purchased a house just off campus to serve as its local headquarters
The purchase alarmed some Princetonians indicating as it did that the organization intended to become a permanent presence at the university
Almost from the beginning rumors about the group and its alleged hidden agenda were circulated in both Catholic and nonCatholic circles in the community
Among liberal Catholics Opus Dei has an image somewhat like that of the Masons in earlier times a malign secret organization with controlling tentacles moving in all directions
Little of this has ever been documented and whatever the group may do in other parts of the world it is clear that in the United States personal piety
From to the official Catholic chaplain at Princeton was Father Charles Weiser a Trenton diocesan priest who directed the Aquinas Foundation
This organization is Princeton s equivalent of the Newman Clubs elsewhere and has its headquarters in a house once occupied by Thomas Mann
Weiser was appointed by the bishop of Trenton and was officially recognized by the university
By his own account Weiser was at first cool to Opus Dei and he describes his early encounters with McCloskey as less than friendly
Eventually however he made the decision to appoint McCloskey an assistant director of the Aquinas Foundation as much as anything according to Weiser to keep an eye on him
""
Shortly afterwards Weiser terminated official relations with another assistant chaplain Jesuit Father Robert Ferrick because of disagreements over Aquinas Foundation policies
Rather than accept Weiser s policies Ferrick left Princeton but his departure caused a good deal of bitterness among his campus admirers
Running through the dispute over Opus and it is revealing that Ferrick s most ardent admirers who attended a weekly midnight Mass he celebrated referred to themselves as the Druids
One of them the leftwing journalist Gloria Emerson noted Something remarkable must have been going on to get a Jewish undergraduate a Puerto Rican methodist sic and an agnostic together for a Catholic worship service
 Ferrick himself in his farewell message listed his constituency as Druids chapel colleagues black and Latino friends those concerned with alcohol and drug abuse the harassed the marginal the foreigner
 Notably absent from the list were those he had been appointed primarily to serve traditional Catholics
Ferrick s departure was the occasion for the first public attacks on Opus Dei attacks notable for the fact that in one of the major scholarly communities in the United States they were made without any felt need to offer proof not even to define terms
Thus Walter Murphy a Catholic saying Opus Dei had Fascist ties
 The closest Opus Dei s critics ever came to offering proof of their charges of a malign hidden agenda was a frequent citing of the book The People of God The Struggle for World Catholicism Viking by the late leftwing journalist Penny Lernoux which claims that Opus Dei has been involved in various rightwing movements in Latin America
Lernoux was hardly a disinterested scholar and Opus Dei officials pointed out that the organization had won a libel suit against her in a West German court
Her book however was cited over and over again as irrefutable evidence of Opus Dei s sinister nature
This alarm was fueled within a community that prides itself on openness and rationality by almost unlimited attention in both the campus and the community press to all the group s critics frequently citing the same people saying the same things over and over again
For a while no mention of Opus Dei in Princeton failed to recall that the woman found murdered in the basement despite the fact that this information had absolutely no bearing on the controversy
For some months before the McCloskey case came to a boil the press related how some Princeton Catholics were worried about the organization and its possible intentions calling it cultlike and possessing a rightwing reputation
 Murphy alleged that Opus Dei had particularly targeted Ivy League universities a charge which if true merely proved that it accepts those institutions own evaluation of their worth
Weiser initially unsympathetic to Opus Dei observed with some irony the behavior of highly rational academics
The guy McCloskey was coming down here three times a week and people are paralyzed by anxiety
The immediate feeling I had was that they were acting like an elephant jumping on a chair trying to get away from a mouse
People were afraid Opus Dei was going to take over 
Critics of McCloskey studiously avoided one inconvenient fact students and others and it was by no means clear that his critics outnumbered his supporters
The critics claimed with considerable vehemence that McCloskey s approach to religion was inherently offensive and oppressive and in case that fact was not known widely enough gave it maximum publicity
But if that was so it seemed to follow that in a highly sophisticated community like Princeton McCloskey s approach would have little success and he would in time be forced to withdraw
What really bothered his critics which for obvious reasons they could not admit was that intelligent people including undergraduates did find his message attractive
The critics task then was to save such people from themselves
The most vocal critic was an undergraduate named Robert Taliercio a member of the leftwing religious group Pax Christi the Peace of Christ who was one of those constantly referring to Opus Dei s supposed rightwing political ties
Taliercio claimed to have attended an Opus Dei program in Spain one summer members lived in very luxurious surroundings If living in opulence is grounds for condemnation it might be supposed that many Princeton students themselves would have to be damned
However for all the talk about rightwing political ideology no Princeton critic of Opus Dei ever reported any direct experience of this
No one claimed that McCloskey tried to influence his political views or to recruit him into any kind of political activity even on such identifiably Catholic issues as abortion
Instead a small number of students reported that they had been offended by McCloskey s approach to what the Catholic Church calls spirituality or personal religious discipline
Some undergraduates no more than a half dozen were ever identified complained that he was overly negative rigid and censorious which turned out to mean that he placed a good deal of emphasis on personal sin warned students to avoid certain occasions of sin and suggested that the larger world merely classical Christian doctrine once taught at Princeton and other Protestant schools and if it is indeed unattractive to modern Americans the problem again would have been selfcorrecting McCloskey would simply have failed in his mission
Thus critics were forced once more to avoid the central issue that in a truly pluralistic environment Catholics were free to accept or reject McCloskey s advice as they saw fit
Instead they had to go through remarkable contortions to conceal the fact that they simply wanted church and university authorities to suppress an individual whose views they found personally distasteful
Some attempt was made to imply that McCloskey had engaged in improper actions such as a female student s claim that he questioned her in the confessional about her sexual activities Allegedly these improprieties had been reported to university authorities
The nadir of yellow journalism in the case was reached by the Trenton Times which reported that evidence of these actions had been given to university sources who prefer to remain anonymous action against them
 The Times thus found it possible to insinuate serious improprieties on McCloskey s part to offer no proof to claim that the evidence existed but was being suppressed and to charge that the university had been intimidated by Opus Dei
If the university did indeed keep the complaints confidential for fear of legal action a logical assumption might be that the complaints were unfounded and would not withstand scrutiny
""
Unable to state frankly that they sought to suppress McCloskey s opinions simply because they found them offensive his critics next fell back on a relatively narrow point that he should not be allowed to represent the Aquinas Foundation since it would officially associate the Catholic Church with his own allegedly distorted theology
But it was the prerogative of the foundation s director and ultimately of the bishop of Trenton to decide who could enjoy official status in the chaplaincy
Weiser later stated that he had investigated every complaint against McCloskey and found no improprieties even though he did
The logic of the critics position was that no one who could be viewed as controversial ought to be given official status by the foundation a contention they would hardly have defended under other circumstances Father Ferrick had also been highly controversial
A priest who for example might have offended some people by passionately supporting the Sandinistas in Nicaragua would in all likelihood be dubbed a prophet and praised for his courage
The nub of the issue was halfconsciously expressed by Taliercio when he accused Opus Dei of trying to stamp out those who do not agree
 But McCloskey was not demanding the expulsion from the Aquinas Foundation of those who did not support his views rather the reverse was the case
In effect his critics position was Opus Dei wants to suppress disagreement so we have to suppress it first
It was the dilemma of modern liberalism in a nutshell is tolerant pluralism either tolerant or pluralistic enough to tolerate those to tolerating only those whose views are like its own
Taliercio said that he had originally been attracted to Opus Dei because it provided security and it makes complicated lives very simple
Everything is black and white
You do nt have to think
 It was a curious confession for an Ivy League student to make prompting as it did the obvious question If you were so easily manipulated then how do you know that you are really thinking right now But it was also necessary to justify the exercise in liberal censorship those who accept the Opus Dei position allegedly do not do so with full freedom and understanding and must be protected by those who know better
In December Suzi Landolphi a professional comedienne performed a routine at Princeton designed to promote both safe sex and feminism which included such things as pulling a male student in front of a video camera ordering him to say vaginal it got caught in your throat
She also had female students stretch condoms over male students heads as a means of desensitizing the audience to contraceptives
McCloskey subsequently published a letter in the Daily Princetonian the official campus newspaper objecting that Landolphi viewed students as salivating animals without any capacity for selfcontrol
 One student responded in a letter by accusing McCloskey of trying once more to enslave women with the holy bond of matrimony and of keeping them barefoot pregnant and in the kitchen an illogical charge given the fact that McCloskey was preaching chastity
The student concluded by suggesting that perhaps the Princeton community
and society at large should advise McCloskey to take to drinking nothing but the semen of AIDS patients
""
Earlier McCloskey s critics had met with the new director of the Aquinas Foundation a Trenton diocesan priest named Vincent Keane to demand McCloskey s removal
Keane who remained publicly noncommital let it be known for using the foundation s name in his letter
Following the semen letter it might have been thought that at least some of McCloskey s critics would begin to wonder whether the tone of the debate was sinking lower than was proper for an elite university but there is no evidence that they were embarrassed by such rhetoric
In some ways the essence of the matter was stated by another student letterwriter who explicitly denied that Opus Dei was entitled to the toleration of a pluralistic open society on the grounds that their agenda is to establish a universal hegemonic view
The writer concluded
In a plural liberal democracy McCloskey is allowed to spread his AIDS Assault on Inquiry Discourses and Speech
But we have our contraceptives open minds
 The Landolphi incident revealed most clearly that the real opposition to Opus Dei therefore was not over its alleged rightwing political ties but over sexual liberation and McCloskey was because he dared to disagree publicly with current conventional wisdom
Intellectual freedom was explicitly described as a contraceptive the purpose of which is to exclude consideration of unfashionable views
That sexual orthodoxy was the root of the tension between McCloskey and some in the Princeton community was confirmed when the G K Chesterton Society sponsored a talk by Maggie Gallagher the author of a book arguing that women have been exploited by the sexual revolution
Gallagher faced a partially hostile audience which at one point pelted the stage with condoms
A feminist student published a review of the speech which stopped just short of saying that Gallagher should have been barred from campus arguing that she appeared under false pretenses since she failed to acknowledge that she supported patriarchy The Chesterton Society was then accused of being an Opus Dei front organization founded to give the group unmerited intellectual respectability although members pointed out that only some of them were affiliated with Opus Dei
McCloskey s defenders soon found themselves in a forth yet another barrage of attacks which widened to include not only McCloskey but any student who dared to defend him
The techniques were classic McCarthyism ceaselessly repeated charges offered without proof unsubstantiated claims often by unnamed people hints about confidential evidence which was being suppressed
Opus Dei found itself in the impossible situation of having to say in effect over and over again We are not a cult
""
McCloskey s critics repeatedly criticized the Aquinas Foundation and the university for not investigating their charges
But Luis Tellez head of Opus Dei s Princeton house pointed out that no one had ever filed a formal complaint against McCloskey with the university authorities which would have resulted in an investigation in which McCloskey could have defended himself
The critics weapon was primarily an unceasing propaganda barrage and they seem to have calculated correctly as it turned out that such an assault would eventually achieve their goal without the obligation of having to prove their charges in any rigorous concerning matters of sexual behavior the critics began claiming that he had warned students against taking particular courses and prohibited them from reading particular books and that Opus Dei members themselves are forbidden to read certain works
They therefore asserted that McCloskey s approach to education was fundamentally at odds with the nature of the university
McCloskey in turn claimed that the allegations were untrue or highly distorted
The only smoking gun the critics could find which they attempted to establish as the murder weapon was a memo from the priest listing about forty courses of possible interest from a Christian culture viewpoint at Princeton University
 The list was drawn directly from the university catalogue and included nine academic departments its net cast wide enough to include both The Religion of Islam and The Origins of Modern Science
Criticism centered on a note appended to the list Remember everything depends on the outlook of the teacher giving the course
The latter may seem quite interesting and stimulating impact is counterproductive
This warning critics trumpeted was censorship of the worst kind and in violation of the very nature of free inquiry
But no critic even alleged that McCloskey s list omitted courses that should have been included which would have been the obvious way of censoring courses the priest thought unacceptable and on the face of it the list was a recommendation not a condemnation
McCloskey gave no indication which courses if any he considered antiChristian and his warning was no different from the kind feminists and militant ethnic minorities issue all the time on university campuses
Thus critics were in the position to assert that McCloskey had no right to evaluate university courses no matter how mildly or obliquely a curious understanding of the nature of free inquiry
At the end of last March six students circulated an open letter to the Princeton community accusing McCloskey of using the tactics of intimidation and claiming that his presence on campus was detrimental to the their names appended to the list not all of them Catholics
Although McCloskey s critics portrayed him as fostering ignorance in contrast to those like themselves who valued knowledge their publicity was consistently marred by elementary errors
Thus on their petition the name of the historian Carl Schorske was spelled Scherske and one student claimed that McCloskey had warned her against reading Bertram Russell
""
Tellez issued a detailed response to the petition mentioning among other things the libel suit against Penny Lernoux and the fact that no formal complaint against McCloskey had been lodged with the university he also said that certain statements attributed to McCloskey were not authentic
McCloskey s defenders were at a constant disadvantage however since his critics used each defense merely as an occasion to mount the same charges even more aggressively a tactic which both the university and the community press were more than willing to permit
Keane who had met with twenty people demanding McCloskey s ouster now had no right to warn students about antiChristian courses Keane cited his own experience as a college professor of speech pathology to justify his judgment apparently an act of professional solidarity with professors for whom freedom includes immunity from criticism
The Daily Princetonian after giving McCloskey s critics maximum publicity for months now formally sided with those critics in an editorial decreeing that the Opus Dei group should be allowed to preserve its religious identity but only to the extent that its practices do not intrude upon the university s academic mission
 Both this statement and Keane s seemed to imply that academic freedom includes professors immunity from outside criticism
The Princetonian s formula also seemed to imply that Opus Dei s preservation of its religious identity is a privilege granted by the university
In April Keane announced that McCloskey would not be returning to the Aquinas Foundation in the fall a decision McCloskey said had been conveyed to him in December the time of the approximately nine hundred Catholic students on campus had signed the petition against him and categorically denied their charges
The Princetonian article announcing his dismissal was a comedy of errors which scarcely bolstered the claim that McCloskey s critics represented responsible scholarship
Keane appeared to be advocating affirmative action for Hawaiians when he was quoted as saying that he hoped to replace McCloskey with a lei woman and the student paper identified Keane s photograph as McCloskey s giving rise to a deliciously wicked fantasy on the part of McCloskey s supporters that of posting copies of the paper all over campus with the notation This man has been officially found to be dangerous to students
If you see him on campus detain him and call the police
""
Now even the claim by McCloskey s critics that the issue was the relatively narrow one of whether he ought to be officially associated with the Aquinas Foundation was belied when following the announcement of his nonrenewal they continued to press for a university air the same charges against him
Keane s action in surrendering to McCloskey s critics was curious in part because of their increasingly frank agenda
One student writing for the Princetonian accepted Opus Dei s claim to loyalty to the pope but asserted that good Catholics need pay no attention to him One leader of the antiMcCloskey faction who published a lengthy attack against him signed a proabortion advertisement in the Princetonian However when Weiser wrote a letter to the newspaper arguing that McCloskey had been mistreated it was not published
The letter later appeared in a conservative student publication the Princeton Sentinel in a summary of the case in which several of the students who signed the petition against McCloskey admitted that they never met him and had signed at the urging of their friends 
McCloskey and Opus Dei intend to remain active in Princeton and McCloskey has said that his exclusion from the Aquinas Foundation might actually make his work easier
The pastor of St Paul s Catholic Church board member of the Aquinas Foundation who said he was not consulted about McCloskey s removal has commented It seems that a little orthodoxy scares a lot of people
 Princeton University itself seems to bear little responsibility for what happened to the priest
There is no evidence that the university sought his removal although the few officials who spoke publicly mildly criticized McCloskey
Primary responsibility rests with Keane who appears to have decided simply to buy peace
Even if every single charge against McCloskey were true his comments and actions were within the bounds of what is usually defined as academic freedom
Ironically in the future those in the Princeton community
inclined to think that Catholic officials fail to respect this freedom have only to look at the treatment accorded John McCloskey to find prime evidence for their thesis
Section REPORTS FROM THE ACADEMY PREFORMATTED TABLE
Alexander Pope
My association with the English department at Duke University began in 
Having taken my bachelor s and master s degrees at the University of Tennessee I was looking for a place to study for the doctorate and was interested in a change in academic scenery
As I considered various programs Duke University kept surfacing as a particularly attractive choice
It was small but not too small it had educated two of my best undergraduate professors its library was spectacularly fine and with its gothic architectural splendor and lush gardens it was the most beautiful place I had ever seen
Furthermore in my English studies thus far I had often found Duke scholars such as Allan Gilbert on Dante and the Renaissance Benjamin Boyce on eighteenthcentury culture Newman I White on Shelley and Lionel Stevenson C R Sanders and Paull F Baum on Victorian literature particularly valuable
Their work was thorough serious and solid something new and worthwhile
I entered the doctoral program at Duke concentrating primarily on eighteenth and nineteenthcentury English literature and after taking my PhD
in moved on to the University of Rochester as an Andrew Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow
Thus began a career that has taken me to a number of institutions given me a chance to write teach and chair for perhaps too many years an English department and generally has allowed me to experience the kinds of ups and downs usually associated with an academic career
Through it all I found that my training at Duke served me well
Duke could not of course strike brilliance from such ordinary stuff as I but it did give me a thorough grounding in the English language and English literary history and an exposure to a very broad range of English American and world literature
It also instilled in me the sense that however important the profession and my own career might be to me literature and culture were much more so and moreover quite transcended in significance the relatively small world of American academic life
After I had little contact with affairs at Duke
Then in the fall of I received a Duke University English Newsletter a publication promising to be the first in an ongoing semiannual enterprise to keep alumni and friends of the Department up to date on what s going on in the Department
My first perhaps naive response was one of at least mild pleasure
Learning about the goingson in one s old graduate program seemed innocent enough though I do remember thinking that the rather slickly produced publication seemed just a bit vulgar and out of key with the Duke I had known
In my time selfadvertisement was viewed with something like disdain and we graduate students joked that the classic departmental recommendation was the onesentence statement that a given candidate was not without redeeming virtue
Well this chirpy little newsletter was a far cry from the whole inoffensive
It listed the current departmental faculty with a paragraph about each professor s background and publications
At the end of this section however I came bolt upon the following
We hope that it is our humanness as well as our professional achievements that will come to the fore in future issues of the Newsletter enough so at least to make you want to read about who and what we are what we do what we think and even what we re like when we are outside the hallowed halls of academe
Perhaps I was too sensitive but this statement positively jarred
Just what did they mean by humanness I was certainly far from convinced that whatever it might be it could be communicated in a sixpage newsletter
Suspecting them of cant I thought they rather expected more interest in them personally than was warranted
If I detected something selfserving and selfimportant in that statement some of my fears were a successful Duke Writers Conference was discussed which attracted national attention apparently a mention in the New York Times held rigorous workshops and created a rich environment
Another item noted a predictably successful Association of Departments of English meeting held at Duke having virtues other than statistical and featuring papers exhibiting gratifying qualifies of mutual admiration
It was concluded that the most fortunate departments are those at small private universities like Duke no doubt
The issue closed with the revelation that the PhD
no longer required historical distribution
Now each program would be shaped by the individual student and PhD
courses spoke more directly to the students courses of concentrated study and were extremely popular
""
Here I began to see two features that would become all too characteristic of subsequent issues an emphasis on publicity as opposed to intellectual value the department s favor
The newsletter I would soon realize seldom reported anything without first assuring the reader it was excellent successful the best or important
This left the unsettling impression that selfcongratulation publicityseeking and a very dubious curricular freedom had become the order of the day
The Spring issue contained a rather bland section on the journals published by the department
Although it focused a bit heavily on the great distinction of these journals the rest of this issue was informative and relatively modest
When Fall arrived I was gratified by the long lead article on the great Carlyle Letters project
This undertaking begun by C R Sanders in the sixties is a genuinely important work of literary scholarship arguably the finest ever done at Duke
A lengthy piece followed however on a new department member Prof Frank Lentricchia who seemed an odd choice for Duke
He was himself a Duke upon in my time
Furthermore his recent work had focused on highly theoretical contemporary political and rather narrowly professional subjects
After the New Criticism his most notable book achieved great success due I suspect to the hope of many bewildered scholars that it would help them make sense of the opaque jargonridden wastes of contemporary theory
At one point Prof Lentricchia tossed a crumb in the direction of Duke s past commitment to historical literary scholarship but it was clear to anyone familiar with his work that his loyalties lay elsewhere and that a department comprised of Lentricchia and others like him would be unlikely to produce another Carlyle Letters project
Indeed his appearance on the scene strongly suggested that an idea of scholarship was beginning to obtain that was less catholic literary balanced and disinterested than I had known
My suspicions were increased by another piece on the new undergraduate English major which it was said would now concentrate on A student interested primarily in the history of the novel could now mainly take courses related to that interest requirements based on historical literary periods would be largely scrapped
Lest readers consider this approach flimsy ahistorical overly specialized or irresponsible the Newsletter assured us that students were required to take a course on a major author Chaucer Shakespeare or Milton
How one course on Milton would make much sense to an undergraduate largely read in the history of the novel the Newsletter did not indicate
My fears about the Duke of crystallized when the piece concluded with the following example of English prose As students recognize the excellence of an English major to later experience both personal and professional we hope to see increased interest in our courses continue
It was a use of excellence with which I was unfamiliar
The Spring Newsletter on first blush brought little bad news
But in the midst of S Eliot and Robert Penn Warren there was an incoherent and largely incomprehensible piece by Prof Gerald Monsman on his application of Derrida s deconstructive possibilities to Walter Pater and of all people Charles Lamb
I pointed out that for Pater there is no privileged source of meaning within the text not the author s life not the fate of his characters not the text s intellectual precursors not the increments appended to it by the readercritic but rather that each component generates alternative possibilities of meaning because the imagery of the text contains within itself multiple contradictory echoes
This passage left me with three reflections first that this might given deconstructionist assumptions be applied to any writer second that Prof Monsman s prose had benefited little from his study of Pater and third that this was a rather ominous straw in the wind regarding the English department
I was at least right about the third reflection
In further reading replaced by a fragmented TOOLONG affair involving seven different courses each doing its own thing taught by faculty from every manner of department and presided over by a resident composition theorist
The crowning touch was that each freshman would choose which course best suited him
This latest revelation regarding program reform brought everything into focus
Whether freshman senior major or PhD
candidate each student was to do whatever was right in his own eyes
Any concept of common expectations experience and bodies of knowledge as well as a meaningful core curriculum was clearly becoming a rare bird at Duke
It then dawned on me that without all these not only students but professors also would be blissfully free to pursue merely their own specialized interests
This insight would prove useful in deconstructing later newsletters
Looking back I see that the first four issues were merely preparatory
Their selfcongratulation selfadvertisement general complacency justification of questionable were prelude to the grand announcement in the Fall issue that Stanley Fish was coming to Duke as was his wife and fellow theorist Jane Tompkins
It was also noted though rather parenthetically that Fredric Jameson America s foremost Marxist critic would soon grace the halls of Duke
Clearly something big was afoot
We had been told that the emperor was being fitted for a set of magnificent new clothes and now the attendants were arriving with the complete line
Just what Prof Fish s impending presence signified was evident
In accord with his resistance to orthodoxies and impetus to change Fish feels that the greatest excitement in literary studies today is in feminist studies because of the unwillingness to stop at any boundary real and imagined
He notes that the revisionary energy of literary studies currently rests in feminist studies
Prof Tompkins in an accompanying piece described her view of literature as a form of political power her suspiciousness literary works that do social work
She indicated that as a populist and feminist critic she likes to say that the road from Uncle Tom s Cabin leads to The Valley of the Dolls
Even to a reader of limited insight it was evident that Prof Lentricchia and Prof Monsman were but humble JohntheBaptists to the true prophets
Those prophets had now arrived and with a new gospel
The precise nature of that gospel became brilliantly clear in succeeding issues
Anything concerning traditional literary study literary history the canon literature per se was out or at least deeply suspect
Contemporary theory postmodernism pop culture political approaches gay studies feminist studies and the New Historicism with its Marxist assumptions were the new Duke
Despite the seeming diversity of these approaches their essential sameness was quickly revealed in the newsletter though such revelations could theory
When for instance Prof Fish was quoted in the Fall issue as saying Once you have subtracted from the accidents of class race gender and political circumstance what is it that you have left it was perfectly in character
The sorts of preoccupations and limitations implicit in Prof Fish s question quickly came to shape almost everything in the department and this was mirrored in the Newsletter
Thus in the Spring issue it was announced that nonperiod specialization would be the new emphasis at Duke
Such shifts in focus require new faculty bringing to Duke Marianna Torgorvnick a cultural critic and Jane Gaines a media critic
The piece on Prof Gaines was particularly interesting
At one point she indulged in the sort of logic becoming quite common at Duke I have argued that film studies belongs in English departments because this strange presence better answers the question What is literature a close study of those texts which are not considered literature
Maintaining that people in film and television studies must find every manifestation of mass culture significant she went on to assure the reader that such scholarship is quite respectable Now Duke can move ahead with assurance because media studies has established its theoretical pedigree
Academic study of film and television is respectably aligned with the most sophisticated French theories
No doubt
The Fall newsletter heralded the hiring of another couple Professors Annabel and Lee Patterson were the result of another impressive year of recruiting
It was made clear that the Pattersons were linked not only in marriage but also in their commitment to the political study of literature
Annabel Patterson specifically affiliated herself with the reaction against the reaction against political history
Readers would perhaps have liked to ask whose political history but that would be frowned upon and besides we are all expected to know the answer of the new Duke
The first was a lecture by Prof Fish on the irrelevance of theory for practice in sports literary studies and the profession of judging
Examples came from legal texts newspaper articles and the career of former Baltimore Oriole pitcher Dennis Martinez
The second not totally unrelated perhaps involved the graduate English program no longer were specific requirements needed to ensure the coverage of historical periods of literature and comprehensive examinations would cease to be comprehensive and instead focus on a major area
Further the foreign language requirement would also be closely tied to the major area
It occurred tome that with every reiterated claim of greater diversity and range at Duke the actual literary and linguistic horizons of its students seemed to narrow
The next three newsletters focused on continued hiring and the kind of scholarly activity characteristic of the new Duke
The Fall issue announced the acquisition of Barbara Herrnstein Smith who apologized for her of herself as always having been a theorist
Prof Smith s major contribution to theory is that all values are radically contingent
Also noted was the arrival of some younger academics including Regina Schwartz who combined study of the Bible with what else contemporary theory Michael Moses whose main concerns were South American fiction and literary studies within the context of political philosophy and Michael Moon who combined the New Historicism and gay studies
I then read of John Clum s several essays on homosexuality Leigh Deneef s deconstruction of Thomas Traherne and Joseph Porter s explorations of postfeminist tragedy in Shakespeare
The highlight of the issue however was its list of visiting professors among them a Marxist a feminist and a television theorist with a special interest in soap opera
""
Spring stands out for its coy protest that despite recent newspaper accounts the English department
Furthermore it was asserted that the classics are taught and abundantly offering as proof the fact that English majors were required to take a course on either Shakespeare Chaucer or Milton
What more could one ask
What really gets taught at Duke was perhaps more candidly revealed in the Fall issue
New hires were again noted and the stars featured were Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick who was quoted as observing that if the work does nt have a strong political thrust I do nt see how it matters
Such a charge can hardly be leveled against her
Her work centers on male sexuality central oppressions in our culture and the AIDS epidemic
What literature Prof Sedgwick addresses in this worthy scholarship was not revealed though the newsletter published the titles of two of her papers How to Bring Your Kids Up Gay and Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl
Apparently the classics are not dead at whose interests include contemporary marginal literatures
Despite his brave commitment to the contemporary he lamented his students lack of historical perspective The literature of the s and s is ancient history
These are people who first came to social awareness in if not 
Compensations however do exist for Prof Ferraro
He is delighted to be in a department he noted in which The Godfather is deemed a masterpiece
The latest newsletter continues to tell the good news about hiring and we read that Duke has a new star in black studies two new feminist theorists and my favorite a specialist in daily life
This learned person is particularly interested in the scholarly contemplation of aerobics shopping malls Barbie dolls Michael Jackson and Mickey Mouse
I do nt know that we should be very surprised that the department s new Mickey Mouse authority comes to Duke after an appointment in the California at Santa Cruz
As tempting as it is to close on this sublime bit of bathos I really can not do so for despite its rich comic value the new English at Duke is not finally funny
If ayear professors at one of America s most expensive and elitist schools want to posture as good comrades populists and the vanguard of class struggle probably no lasting harm is done to them
There are undoubtedly however students at Duke who would like to study literature
What they are actually studying is made all too clear in two of the most recent Newsletters
It is noted that Duke graduate students have given a number of papers lately
And what are we to suppose were their topics Some tides are indicative From Screwballs to Cheeseballs Comic Narrative and Ideology from Frank Capra to Rob Reiner Fear and Loathing in the Literary Canon
The Gynecology of the Closet in The Changeling a Gender Paradigm and Kierkegaard Marxism and Poststructuralism
""
This list is to me inexpressibly sad
Not only is the dreary sameness of the assumptions and preoccupations depressing but completely or almost completely absent is any sign that the authors of these works have had any real exposure to the rich beautiful endlessly fascinating and genuinely liberating fullness canonical and noncanonical of English and American literature from AngloSaxon times to our own
In the final analysis it is not so much what the Duke English department actually does that matters as silly as much of it is rather it is their painful and ultimately absurd desertion of literature as a great human art and as a great instrument of culture in the Arnoldian sense that condemns them
By Phillip B Anderson
Phillip B Anderson is professor of English and chairman of the Department of English at the University of Central Arkansas Conway AR and Section POINT OF VIEW
Should the curriculum include more humanities Many thoughtful people think so
They argue that the humanities are needed to help us get back in touch with our essential humanity regain our moral insight recover our sense of values return to our cultural roots and restore our political traditions Like the humanities themselves this argument is inspirational but vague and because it is vague it is dangerous
It leaves many questions unanswered and this leaves room for people to answer these questions in ways we might not like
Here are some of the questions that need answering
What exactly are the humanities Which courses in humanities will students be required to take Why should these courses be preferred to those they will replace Who will teach these courses and whose humanity moral insight values culture and tradition will they advance How will these courses be taught I believe that these and similar questions must whether requiring more humanities is a good idea or a bad one
The Vagueness of the Idea of the Humanities
If anything can safely be said about this subject it is that the term humanities is not well defined
Consider the list of courses that will satisfy the humanities requirement in my own university s socalled core curriculum This list which is typical contains just under a hundred items and is still growing
In addition to the usual courses in literature classics history anthropology philosophy and religion there are also courses in art music both jazz and classical dance American studies women s studies Latin American studies communications political science speech film etc
This is a very heterogeneous and divergent lot
These courses may have what the philosopher Wittgenstein called family resemblance meaning that A has eyes like B who has a nose like C but there is almost certainly no way in which they all resemble each other
long but that it is too diffuse
No one could object to the richness of choice if it served a clear and coherent educational purpose but if it does who can say what that is Certainly not I Each of these courses may have its value but the value is different in each case
There does not seem to be anything that all of them have in common
So there does not seem to be any reason to group them all together and require every student to take one or more
It is sometimes said that the humanities all have in common a concern with values
Accordingly courses in art and literature treat of things that embody aesthetic values and courses in feminism or Marxism treat of economic political and moral values
Yes but every human activity including science and engineering either treats of or embodies values
Thus the social sciences treat of values in discussing human behavior and the physical sciences embody values by preferring evidence the exclusive possession of the humanities
We could of course try to limit the humanities to particular sorts of values
For example we could try limiting them to aesthetic values
The humanities would then include nothing but courses in art music and literature
Women s studies and communications would be left out
Yes but also left out would be the first two parts of Northrop Frye s famous triad of humanities philosophy history and literature
Why not then simply limit the humanities to Frye s triad Because that would leave nothing out
Philosophy history and literature are universal media they cover everything
So once you ve included them you ve included everything else too
We could leave out the arts if we limited the humanities to moral values but we would then have to include women s studies black studies economics politics and so on
In fact social science would now comprise most of the humanities desires
Evidently it is hard to find a characterization of the humanities that will limit them to a short and welldefined list of things
In fact every choice is arbitrary
Although no single principle rule or definition determines what counts among the humanities there is a perfectly good explanation and justification for every item on virtually everybody s list
Humanities Has Added New Meaning with Each Age
Why this is so will become evident after we review the history of the concept of the humanities
As this history reveals the word humanities is a chameleon which has changed its color to suit every age and ideology
In consequence it has not one welldefined meaning but many different if overlapping meanings
So far as I have been able to discover the idea of the humanities originated in the Renaissance when scholars tired of medieval theology and otherworldliness distinguished literae humaniores writings about things human in scale from literae divinae writing about things divine in been given over to God and the church most of the downtoearth writings were in classical Latin or Greek
Therefore the first humanists were classicists lovers and scholars of classical literature
More generally they were admirers of things classical devotees of classical ie Greek and Roman literature art and culture
Present use of the term humanities still retains some of its original meaning but the term has also acquired a very different connotation one that is in some ways broader in other ways narrower
First the broader connotation
Where medieval theology had been dry and logical the classics were elegant and charming
So the adjective humanistic soon came to connote not just the subject but also the style of the writing
In fact style eventually counted for more that content
Whether the writing was about man or God ceased to matter very much what mattered was whether it was refined or florid
Hence humanities now more often denotes what the French anything at all human or divine
Once this extension of usage came into existence a still further extension was soon to follow
If what made literature humanistic was its refinement or elegance then the same could be said of all art whether literary or not
Accordingly humanities has come to denote not just poems and stories but all refined art including painting music sculpture film and the like
As a result humanistic now means arty in other words refined cultivated and effete
This broadening of the term to include all of the refined arts has been accompanied by a compensating narrowing
In the Renaissance humanists prized classical discussions of science
One of the greatest discoveries of humanist scholars was a copy of Lucretius poem On the Nature of Things which made known to modem scientists the atomic theory of matter first formulated by Democritus of classical Greece
Also of interest to Renaissance humanists were Roman writings on engineering governmental administration and to adopt the factual analytical manner of the medieval scholastics science and technology ceased to count as humanistic
In fact both science and its technological applications came to be regarded as the embodiment of all things that were not humanistic
C P Snow s two cultures came into being as science became antihumanistic and humanists became antiscientific
The exclusion of things scientific was completed in the nineteenth century when the German romantics distinguished what they called Geistewissenschaffen studies of the spirit from what they called Naturwissenschaffen studies of the physical world Believing that a human being is essentially a spiritual not a physical being the Germans reinterpreted the humanities as inspirational studies the main purpose of which was to influence not the intellect but the will and the emotions
This made theology which had originally been the very opposite of a humanistic study into the most important such study
It also meant that science was now formally excluded from the humanities by virtue of its content as well that had flowed from science
Accordingly humanistic now meant things ornamental inspirational and cultivated but unscientific and impractical 
In summary the word humanities originally meant the naturalistic writings then the naturalistic art of classical Greece and Rome
Later it signified any form of refined art or writing and then any form of art or writing that is edifying inspirational or entertaining but not analytical informative or utilitarian
At one time or another therefore humanities has denoted just about anything anybody cares to mention
Given this history it is no wonder that lists of the humanities are so lengthy and diffuse
One might desire to prune these lists but there is no obvious and principled way to do it
In the history of the term humanities one can find a justification for every item on the list
So whether he likes it or not a friend of the humanities is committed to them all
The Diverse Values of diffuse and divergent collection of things The customary answer is again one that mentions values
We teach the humanities it is said in order to teach our pupils a sense of aesthetic moral political economic or intellectual values
Let us now examine this answer
Obviously it owes a lot to the romantic conception of the humanities
In that conception the humanities are inspirational rather than scientific studies their main function as the romantics themselves emphasized is to cultivate not the intellect but the passions and the will
In other words their business is to inculcate us with certain moral and aesthetic values
Where the sciences teach facts and logic the humanities are to teach feelings obligations and taste
Where the sciences teach us how the world is the humanities teach us what it ought to be
Where the sciences endeavor to understand the world the humanities aspire to take the right attitude towards it and make efforts to improve it idea is questionable because it leaves out the social sciences which deal with both facts and values and overlooks the fact that natural science embodies and teaches the values inherent in a preference for reason and truth
However let us overlook these difficulties
For the sake of the discussion let us grant the distinction
How does it help
So far as I can see it does not
Here is why once the topic of values has been raised we inevitably face the question Whose values Mine or yours You like Mozart I like Monk
Who will we teach our students to like You prefer Matisse I prefer Grandma Moses
Who will we teach our students to prefer Jones favors feminism Smith a strong family
Which will we teach our students to favor Sarah believes in free enterprise Sam in socialist equality
Which will we teach our students to believe in
To some people the answer will seem to prefer what is beautiful to what is ugly what is good to what is bad what is true to what is false and so on
Unfortunately these abstract terms truth beauty justice goodness etc conceal great intellectual and practical problems
Who gets to decide what is to count as true beautiful just or good You I or somebody else
This is no problem where you and I who share essentially the same values are designing a curriculum for a private school or university supported by voluntary contributions and attended by people who wish to be taught what we wish to teach them
Designing a curriculum for a public school or university however presents a moral difficulty
This arises from the fact that it is contrary to the principles of a free society to compel citizens to pay taxes to support the teaching of values that can not be reconciled with their own consciences and interests and it is doubly onerous to compel them The public schools are nobody s private property
They do not belong to any group to do with as it pleases
Rather they are the property of all who must pay the taxes that support them or submit their children to their tutelage
What Are Our Choices
What then should we do The answer I think lies in giving up the idea of using the schools to teach students values per se and insisting instead that they be taught skills
In particular we can insist they be taught the intellectual skills that used to be known as the liberal arts
I believe that in the process of learning these valuable skills students will also automatically acquire some of the most important values namely respect for discipline hard work reason truth honesty excellence achievement civility etc
There will be no need or room for indoctrination
These remarks will puzzle some readers
It is generally believed that the humanities and the liberal So it will seem inconsistent to praise the one while condemning the other
It is also widely believed that the main business of teaching the humanities is to refine the tastes and improve the morality and politics of our pupils
So it will seem selfcontradictory to reject doing this while recommending training for citizenship
How the Liberal Arts Differ from the Humanities
To resolve these paradoxes I must now explain how the liberal arts differ from the humanities and why teaching the skills necessary for good citizenship can escape the temptation to engage in political or moral indoctrination
The idea of the liberal arts was invented by the ancient Romans to whom the word arts meant skills and the word liberal signified free
Accordingly the great Roman writers Cicero and Seneca explained that the liberal arts were the intellectual skills needed by free men as opposed to the menial skills needed by slaves
Among the liberal arts as thus understood were the skills of calculating reasoning reading writing and responsibility and prerogative as citizens to participate in making or approving policy for the republic
In short the liberal arts were the skills needed for free and effective citizenship
The term liberal arts retained this rich and complex meaning throughout the Middle Ages
In the typical medieval university the basic studies were the seven artes liberales which comprised the trivium of logic grammar and rhetoric and the quadrivium of arithmetic geometry astronomy and music ie poetry
Higher education involved the study of more esoteric subjects revealed philosophy ie theology natural philosophy ie science and moral philosophy ie ethics
Anyone who went through this curriculum got a liberal education one fitting him not to earn a living or enrich himself at a particular occupation but to fulfill his public responsibilities as a citizen
He could read write and reason at a very high level of proficiency
It should now be clear that the liberal the concept of the liberal arts is far better defined
Second the liberal arts are skills whereas the humanities are subjects
Third mathematics is one of the most important of the liberal arts but it is positively excluded by the romantic conception of the humanities
Fourth although they are intellectual rather than occupational skills the liberal arts are useful rather than ornamental utilitarian rather than inspirational unlike the humanities as they are presently conceived the liberal arts can not be equated with the refined arts
Finally there is no antagonism between the liberal arts and either science or technology
Teaching the Liberal Arts Should Be Our First Priority
My contention broadly stated is that we ought to concern ourselves first with instruction in the liberal arts
We should make the teaching of the subjects embodied in the humanities and in the social or natural sciences a goal of secondary importance to the inculcation of intellectual skill
The reasons are obvious
Everybody needs these skills but few my own experience as a college teacher confirms students these days can not read or write or calculate much less reason effectively
I know from personal experience that we are now graduating with BA and BS degrees people who can not write grammatical sentences read and understand paragraphs calculate simple percentages or compose a coherently formulated argument things many eighth graders could do fifty years ago
This is shocking it is shameful and it desperately needs to be corrected
But we are not going to correct it if we continue to fight over whose values to teach
Instead we shall just distract attention from what truly and most urgently needs to be done namely restoring to our students the capacity to reason seriously
The task may seem insuperable but if we attempt it we have one thing going for us it is in fact an objective that virtually everybody whatever his political or religious convictions can support because virtually everyone will benefit from its realization
arts as much of them as we can get
So anybody with any sense wants to be able to read and write at as high a level of proficiency as his abilities will allow
For this reason alone instruction in the liberal arts ought to be one of the main tasks of public education in a free society
Training people in the refined arts ought to come second
So should training in the occupational or vocational arts as well as training in moral religious and political values
Please note that nothing in this proposal either rules out teaching the humanities the social sciences or any other subject or denigrates the importance of exposing students to rival values and views of life
It just requires that these be taught with an eye to increasing the student s level of literacy numeracy and general powers of reason
What better way to teach students to read and think than by doing it through Plato the Bible Shakespeare Jefferson Marx or to take courses which are aimed at influencing their attitudes and conduct but not at raising their level of intellectual skill
Unfortunately humanities courses do not always satisfy this standard
In a passionate and eloquent essay on the topic writer and former teacher Ellen Ashdown has pointed out that many humanities courses in the public junior colleges are designed not to raise the level of student literacy but to accommodate the illiterate student Such courses use books with lots of pictures in them and rather than teaching the student to read or write they rub a little high culture off on him while collecting his fees
The universities have little cause to feel superior
To see why not consider English and history the two most popular fields in the humanities
When taught correctly they are excellent vehicles for inculcating the liberal arts but they are not always taught in the right way
Teaching the liberal arts is laborintensive it takes time Professors in the public universities have far too many students to Thus as William Arrowsmith pointed out long ago the professors of English generally leave the teaching of literacy to their graduate students to whom they teach literature The professors of history do something similar
They teach great masses of students names and dates in mindnumbing survey courses while graduate students mark the papers
This is not the fault of the professors who are often doing as best they can under difficult circumstances but it nonetheless needs to be corrected
Until it is corrected we can not automatically expect students to learn the liberal arts from studying English and history
Conclusion
The moral of the story is this an argument can be made for requiring students especially in the public schools to study courses whether in the humanities or not when these are taught with a eye to inculcating the liberal arts the basic intellectual skills that every citizen requires
Little argument can be made however for increased study of the humanities where this will have the result of substituting the the basic skills of the intellect and no argument at all in support of using the humanities to indoctrinate students in the moral religious or political values of any group
It will be objected that teaching people to read write calculate and reason is the business of the grammar and the high schools and so it is
But I believe that the colleges and universities should also teach these skills albeit at a higher level
Furthermore the debate over which level should do it is academic
At the moment neither the grade schools nor the institutions of higher education are teaching the liberal arts
They must both go back to doing so
For reasons that the ancient Romans understood well but we have somehow managed to forget our preservation as a republic of free citizens may depend on it
This brings us back to politics
As these last remarks suggest the purpose of teaching the liberal arts is political but it is political in the broadest and best competency in the liberal arts is good for the whole political order and everybody in it
Emphasizing the primacy of the liberal arts is however certainly not political in the narrow and bad but popular sense of that word the liberal arts are not partisan they do nt favor the program of this political party over that one they do nt advance one group s interests at the expense of another s
Rather possessing the liberal arts enables every group to advance its own interests and thereby the wellbeing of the whole
Section FOR THE RECORD
Editor s Note The following is adapted from a letter and accompanying essay that were sent to each of the regents of the University of California at the close of the spring semester by Prof Sarich
April 
Dear Regent
I write to you in your capacity as a regent of the University of California concerning recent admissions policies at the University of California at Berkeley
My concern over these as both a citizen and longtime member of the Berkeley faculty prompted the preparation of the attached longish essay
The essay speaks for itself this little note is included simply to introduce it
I will assume that the regents approved these policies
Thus I have to ask Are nt these policies illegal on their face What sort of legal support can there be for policies that by this year have reduced whites among incoming freshmen to barely half their numbers among high school graduates as a whole University of California system Are nt they also immoral What other word is there to apply to policies that tell someone Well you worked hard and really achieved but we ca nt reward you for that achievement because your skin is the wrong color
Is it so difficult for you to see what you ve done to the Berkeley campus You have given us two communities of students roughly percent in one and percent in the other whose academic achievements prior to coming here barely overlap
I assure you it does nt get any better once they re here
One community has been drawn from the academic top percent or so the other is only slightly above the average for all high school graduates
What do you suppose is going to happen in any competitive environment and if Berkeley ceases being competitive it might as well cease being given those circumstances What you ve done is to ensure that academic performance and achievement at Berkeley will be strongly correlated you wish to teach Do you really want to promote segregation and racialethnic tension Because that s exactly what you re doing
I m sending the same letter to all regent
I am well aware that some of you are enthusiastically for these policies and that others are just as against them as I but I really do nt have the time to individualize these nor to figure out which camp you might belong to
PREFORMATTED TABLE Essay
The San Francisco Chronicle of January carried a story headlined US to Probe UC Berkeley for Bias Against White Applicants which prompts the thought What s to probe There can be no question that the Berkeley administration has over the past few years instituted admissions policies that have systematically and increasingly discriminated against white students
The basic facts documenting the presence and extent of bias are clear and readily available even if only rarely presented in a useful form
We know that the two main factors determining school academic achievement plus standardized tests scores and more recently race andor ethnicity as well
We also know the racialethnic composition of the pool of California high school graduates of the roughly percent considered academically eligible for admission to the University of California system and of the new freshman registrants leaving out foreign students at Berkeley see table 
So whites comprise about percent of California high school graduates and close to percent of those academically eligible for admission to the University of California system while the actual white percentages of entering classes at Berkeley has dropped from percent in to percent in 
By then the proportion of whites admitted had been reduced to barely half their representation among all public high school graduates as well as among the percent academically eligible for admission to the University of California system one has to note here that about percent of freshmen admitted to Berkeley come from private schools thus making the situation for white public high school graduates even worse than it would appear at first glance
The only reason for excluding the other half of the academically eligible whites is purely and simply the color of their skin
How can there be any doubt of this When a definable group here whites does better than average academically even though they make up most of that average and yet is not represented in numbers that even come close to its proportion in the population concerned high school graduates what else can we conclude The Berkeley administration has thus increasingly mocked its own nondiscrimination statement
In accordance with applicable Federal laws and University policy the University of California does not discriminate in any of its policies procedures or practices on the basis of race color national origin sex sexual orientation age or handicap
And of course it may have also violated states in part
No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws
While there is a great deal of legitimate debate as to the scope and meaning of the latter no one today will ever openly suggest that there can be a legally sanctioned administrative power to tell someone You are a member of race x and because of that we are reducing your chances of being admitted to our community by more than percent
Yet this is precisely what our administration has been telling white California high school graduates in recent years
How much more explicitly racist could one be In addition of course it has been claimed that recent admissions policies at Berkeley are in part a response to legislative pressures results are at substantial variance with the latest version of legislative directives in this area Each segment of California public education shall strive to approximate by the year the general ethnic gender economic and regional composition of high school graduates both in first year classes and subsequent college and university graduating classes Joint Committee for Review of the Master Plan for Higher Education 
Leaving aside questions as to the advisability intelligence and constitutionality of such a policy except to point out its total incompatibility with the mission of higher education it is obvious that Berkeley s recent incoming classes do not even come close to approximating the general ethnic composition of high school graduates and the gap has been growing not closing
With regard to that criterion among the admits Asians blacks and Hispanics are overrepresented by about percent percent and percent respectively and all this is paid for by percent
But this is really an aside
Is nt the ultimate nonpragmatic fact constitutional One can not legally choose someone because of the color of his skin
Period
It is thus a depressing commentary on our times that the Berkeley administration has been allowed to get away with such policies that Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman could state at the news conference announcing his leaving the post that he was proudest of the increase in the ethnic diversity of the undergraduate student body under his administration and that the Berkeley Academic Senate could approve the recommendations of the Karabel Report The vacuity of the last which is the Berkeley faculty s response to perceived problems with recent admissions policies can be seen in the fact that it is simply not possible to follow their fourth principle
Berkeley will absolutely not tolerate quotas or ceilings on the admissions or enrollment of any racial ethnic religious or gender groups
Such quotas or ceilings are both immoral and illegal
Moreover any of the criteria governing its admissions policies
""
Principle which is set in absolute terms can not be upheld in the presence of a policy where percent of the freshman class is to be selected through a process of secondary review where within each secondary review category roughly half the target would be met by accepting those applicants with the highest academic index scores and where one of the factors for the other half would be contribution to the overall diversity of the class
Of course as we might have expected one of these secondary review categories remains affirmative action students Blacks Hispanics American Indians
Given all this it is not at all surprising to note that we find the statement the flexible admissions target for each group would be set primarily on the basis of recent practice and we therefore anticipate that there will be no drastic fluctuations in the numbers from each of these groups to represent some sort of advance Quotas by any other name are still quotas and we as a faculty by our approval of the report are endorsing the continued destruction of any sense of community on the Berkeley campus
There has also been remarkably little if any overt public outcry over these policies though by the same token there is little or no evidence of public approval
There seems to be a general if apathetic acceptance of the notion that their goals are noble equitable and wellintentioned and implicitly that this somehow justifies an unconstitutional practice
One might note here that all too much depressing contemporary history tells us that the roads to many recent hells have been paved with good intentions
There is in addition of course a good deal of white guilt around and a welljustified fear of being tagged with a racist label if one questions policies that have acquired affirmative action status
Well if this effort it
That begins to get us into pragmatic matters
It is unfortunate another aspect of our times that one should have to get into pragmatic matters at all when the policies at issue are prima facie unconstitutional
It should be possible to say simply You can not discriminate for or against someone because of the color of his skin
But in today s California this for the quiet majority is an elitist and esoteric attitude
Very few find a purely constitutional debate at all satisfying
Thus much of the justification and defense of Berkeley admissions policies have been pragmatic in appearance though the reality as will be seen has been a good deal less
One might start with the fact that what has happened to white students has been obscured by the continuing and largely irrelevant controversy concerning the admission of students of Asian ancestry
A conspiracy theorist could readily conclude in fact that it was concocted for precisely this purpose
concerned whites blacks Asians Hispanics it turns out that only Asians are being admitted to Berkeley in proportions that do not differ significantly from their representation in the pool of academically eligible high school graduates see table above and this has been true for a great many years
The numbers and they are not hard to come by make this so clear that one really has to wonder what all the fuss has been about
For Asians then raceethnicity is not a significant factor except for the fact that their meritocratic treatment is so at variance with what is done to everyone else
In other words Asians have been and are being treated fairly with respect to their academic achievements
The problem then is not with them they are being treated just as they always have been it lies instead in the fact that no one else is treated fairly in the chances of white students being admitted are reduced by more than percent just by the defect of their whiteness and the chances of Hispanics and blacks are correspondingly increased by percent and percent respectively compare rows three and five in table again simply on the basis of their race and ethnicity
This is racism pure and simple and easily reminiscent of the infamous negative quotas limiting Jewish enrollment in many of our most prestigious universities which survived well into the s
It is difficult to conceive of grounds on which so racially bound a policy could be defended in court
Now it has been argued in particular by Chancellor Heyman and ViceChancellor Rod Park that to quote the former These achievements are not at the expense of quality as some have claimed San Francisco Chronicle January 
Another common claim to quote administration officials is that everyone admitted to Insight October 
Such statements are at best halftruths
They can be gotten away with only by never defining terms like University of Californiaeligible or academically qualified and by never telling us at whose expense these achievements were managed
About the only actual datum ever referred to in this context is the fact that the mean Scholastic Aptitude Test SAT score of incoming students has been steadily rising
Given that for all its faults the SAT score is the only objective standin for quality that can be applied to all students it is the only academic experience they share let us look into what has actually been going on see table 
Asians and whites admitted to Berkeley in and almost always on academic grounds alone had an average SAT score of about blacks and Hispanics for the vast majority of whom raceethnicity about for the former note that this is also just about the mean for all white high school seniors who took the test for the latter
Ten years previously in the corresponding figures were about for Asians and whites and about for blacks and Hispanics
Thus the gap between the two means has increased by more than points in the past decade from to leading to a situation of minimal overlap percent or less between the two distributions
This current difference is equivalent to a fouryear gap in academic preparationachievement in other words the difference between a college junior and a high school junior
This enormous and growing disparity tells us that on the average minority group students are not going to be competitive with Asians and whites at Berkeley
And whatever the faults of the SAT or any standardized achievement test truth is seen crudely in dropout figures but is much more apparent to those of us who spend much of our time teaching undergraduates in relative performance in the same classes and in the lack of minority representation in our more demanding courses and majors
All this is depressing and most unfortunate but nonetheless true as you get more and more selective among Asians and whites the competitive gap necessarily increases
This is simple statistics and nothing anyone here at Berkeley can do short of admitting only those Asians and whites who score below say could change it
This fact has been obscured by avoiding any mention of the actual numbers involved
Sometimes this avoidance is blatant as in the Information Digest of the University of California Admissions and Outreach Services where on page we are given in one table the SAT scores of University of California freshmen as a whole as compared to national means and in but not of course SAT data by raceethnicity
Indeed to the best of my knowledge raceethnicity SAT data for Berkeley students have never been published
What we have gotten are statements of the type quoted above from Chancellor Heyman and endorsed in many places including unfortunately the Karabel Report The great accomplishment of the overall admissions policy has in our view been its capacity to continue the process of diversification of Berkeley s student body at the same time it has maintained and even raised the academic level of the freshman class 
There is in fact as just noted no positive accomplishment at all
The gap between Asianswhites and blacksHispanics to repeat has increased
The administration has simply traded off larger gains among Asians and whites larger because one is selecting them from further out along the curve for smaller ones among blacks and Hispanics
Their great accomplishment academic level that is the mean SAT score of the freshman class while continuing the process of diversification of Berkeley s student body results from this tradeoff
And the claim blithely ignores the fact that the admissions policy has also produced two student populations percent and percent respectively of the freshman enrollees whose academic levels barely overlap
So while the overall quality that is mean SAT scores of undergraduates may not have declined the relationship between quality and race or ethnicity has become much more strongly marked and the overall quality has certainly declined relative to where it would be if admissions policies were as blind to raceethnicity as they were seven years ago
The problem with the concept of the quality of a performance with respect to reward in a world of limited good ie the number of places at Berkeley is fixed is that it can not be applied in other than if and only if one is willing and able to perform academically at a level commensurate with the demands of the institution and the overall response of the student body to those demands
Therefore once one becomes at all selective that is once something passes from being a right for example the right to compete for a position in a band play or on an athletic team to a privilege an actual position then qualified has to become to an appreciable extent a performancebased term
No one would suggest to Lou Campanelli that he should recruit with an eye to increasing diversity on our basketball team
Nor would anyone look for racialethnic diversity and balance on our Olympic squads
There we choose on the basis of performance
Why Because presumably we want to do the best that we can do
Why should it be any different for our faculty and student body The University of California at Berkeley has been three best institutions of higher learning public or private in this country and probably in the world and being the best means among other things being selective and challenging
We did not achieve that eminence by concerning ourselves with anything other than direct evidence of achievement
That eminence obviously can not be maintained if race sex ethnicity or any other factors are allowed to substitute for achievement
There can not possibly be if we wish to maintain that eminence a performanceindependent right to membership in the university community and to repeat performance whether academic athletic or artistic can not be judged against absolute standards
Any such judgment must be made in a comparative context
You get performance by rewarding performance you ensure nonperformance by rewarding nonperformance
Intellectual performance is no exception
Not to challenge our best student minds and we certainly ca nt challenge them if they re not here nor can the strength of our challenge be as great now our society and the world later and to fail in our mission
To remain the best we must do our intellectual best but when we do that best we raise the required level of performance and degree of competition to the point where less qualified less prepared or less motivated students simply become noncompetitive
And unfortunately the levels of qualification preparation or motivation are not randomly distributed with respect to race and ethnicity
It would be much more realistic to recognize the accomplishments of the Berkeley administration as consisting of the alienation of whites by not admitting them and of minorities by admitting them into an environment where they will tend to do poorly relative to others of course and therefore come to feel quite rightly cheated
Such policies also and this is perhaps the saddest result of all devalue the accomplishments of those minority students who are making it on their own without the benefits at least in theory provide some benefits but diversity in current practice here at Berkeley is something else again
Those potential benefits do not accrue automatically in the presence of increased diversity and there are alltooreal costs as well
But where do we see any attempt even to consider the costs never mind measure them against the potential benefits The costs are obvious and large the benefits if any difficult to perceive and certainly undocumented
We do need to understand better the differences and similarities among cultures their strengths as well as weaknesses and to appreciate that there is much we can learn from one another
But we must also be aware that beliefs and practices where they differ from culture to culture can not in general be neutral that is be equally effective in any particular situation
The academic environment at Berkeley is a very particular situation and clearly performance within it is not neutral with respect to race and ethnicity nor obviously though attention is it neutral with respect to individual variation within groups
That is the reality
It is of course all to easy to ignore unpalatable realities
Unfortunately doing so tends to produce even more unpalatable results
The Berkeley administration has in its admissions policies especially over the past five years or so ignored certain unpalatable realities and given us an even more unpalatable set of results
They have given us a situation where the association between raceethnicity and performance is real obvious and of everincreasing strength
What we are getting at Berkeley is two communities separable on racialethnic grounds and increasingly divergent from one another academically socially and in ethos a result desired presumably by no rational soul
It is frankly difficult to imagine policies more deliberately crafted or better calculated to exacerbate racial and ethnic tensions discourage individual performance among all groups and contribute to the decay of a magnificent educational institution
Postscript
My earlier comments are of course incomplete s all too easy to complain it s sometimes a good deal harder to suggest something better
I do nt see that as the case here
It seems to me quite easy to define a range of policies that would be constitutional be seen as fair and be more or less compatible with the mission of this university
At one end we could have a purely meritocratic system that is we could simply define a set of performance criteria and select in order from those who fulfill them making certain that nothing is added to or subtracted from students scores because of what they are rather than what they have done
At the other we could simply admit the top x percent by performance where x is the same for all groups of each defined group
It would be difficult to justify representation in numbers greater than those merited by performance when that performance is above average by the same token it would be difficult relevant population here all high school graduates when the performance is below average
In other words the final total for each defined group would be somewhere between the figures in the last two rows of table 
I leave unargued the question of whether the whole notion of defined groups in this context is relevant moral fair or productive

The Erosion of Learning and Civility
College students spend on the average much less time studying than even the gloomiest of us had thought
The Carnegie Foundation reports the following conclusions from an unpublished study of fulltime students in fouryear colleges in percent spent less than six hours a week studying outside of class and no more than percent spent sixteen or more hours studying by percent were spending less than six hours a week studying and only percent spent more than percent of fulltime students at fouryear colleges were spending sixteen or fewer hours on their course work outside of class
Since the standard number of class hours is ten to twelve and a half per week twelve to fifteen fiftyminute hours this means that in more than three quarters of our students were engaged in academic work less than twentyeight and a half hours a week even if they never skipped a class while almost a third worked less than eighteen and a half hours per week
The decline in hours spent studying has to be considered against the background fact that students come to college much less well prepared than in the past
The Carnegie report contains no data on this matter but it does mention a survey of professors in which twothirds said they are teaching undergraduates basic skills they should have learned in school
Particular professors at different types of institutions are quoted as saying that students ability even to do simple arithmetic has defined that they and so on
In short just when they should be working hardest to make up for the deficiencies of their past education American students are working fewer hours than ever
And during those hours they study less well than they once did
The quality of student life outside of academic work only adds to one s wish that students would spend more time studying
The Carnegie report is based in part on a survey of college and university presidents
Seventyfive percent of the presidents of liberal arts colleges said that alcohol abuse is a moderate to major problem on their campuses
Eightytwo percent of the presidents of universities research and doctorategranting institutions say the same
One dean of students estimated that between and percent of the undergraduates at his school a prestigious southern university are alcoholics while another to percent are serious weekend drinkers
The grimmer news about universities doubtless pertains to their large undergraduate populations rather than to their presidents complain of sexual harassment on their campuses as opposed to percent of college presidents probably reflects the fact that opportunity and temptation are greater within graduate programs and for male graduate students who serve as teaching assistants in undergraduate courses
In any case universities are clearly tougher places to be and not just for women
Thirtyeight percent of college presidents believe theft to be a moderate to major problem while the figure for university presidents is percent
This document places a major emphasis on racial tensions though the statistics shocking and depressing as they are do not indicate that race is the greatest problem on campus
Twentyeight percent of college presidents and percent of university presidents say that racial tensions are a moderate to major problem on their campuses and percent and percent respectively say that racial intimidationharassment is
However whereas percent of college presidents and percent of university presidents cite interracial intercultural relations as an issue of greatest concern substance abuse primarily alcohol as being of greatest concern
All institutions together which include twoyear colleges and comprehensive institutions ie those not primarily liberal arts rank substance abuse student apathy campus security and crime and inadequate facilities ahead of TOOLONG relations as areas of concern
The Carnegie report is also based on a survey of chief student affairs officers
Whereas percent of those personnel at liberal arts colleges and percent at universities believe that racial tensionshostilities have become a greater problem over the past five years percent and percent respectively believe that alcohol abuse has become a greater problem over the same period
Considering the importance of words within an academic community one sentence in this report is particularly striking On too many campuses incivility is a problem and all too frequently words are used not as the key to understanding but as weapons of assault
The authors go on to cite disturbing
The Carnegie Foundation s Proposed Solution
There is in Campus Life surprisingly litre analysis of the deterioration reported and almost no consideration of its causes
No thought is given to the possibility that drunkenness is a function of excessive leisure time and that racial incidents might be promoted by drunkenness
Racial tensions are highlighted as an especially severe problem just as if those tensions were rooted in racism pure and simple
Then the report leaps from these unconnected particulars to a single allembracing solution that is if not unrelated to the problems to be solved at least inadequate to their solution
The Carnegie Foundation calls upon each school administration to form a new compact for community with its student body
The six principles of that compact are elaborated in the six chapters that form the body of this report
Those chapters are seriatim A Purposeful Community wherein it is admitted and rarely thereafter remembered that a college or university is a place An Open Community wherein a delicate adjustment is achieved between protecting freedom of expression and affirming civility A Just Community which urges the affirmative action and multicultural education package already so popular among college and university administrators A Disciplined Community which reviews the many ways in which existing rules are being violated and offers little to rectify matters A Caring Community which tilts against fraternities and toward more support services for students to be provided by expanded student affairs staffs and A Celebrative Community which recommends traditional ceremonies and ceremonial traditions
An epilogue following these six chapters gives the gist of what is proposed We are convinced that all parts of campus life can relate to one another and contribute to a sense of wholeness
It is of special significance we believe that higher learning institutions continue to use the familiar rhetoric of community to describe campus life
That ideal and rhetoric is the means proposed for achieving it
At least that is what at one level seems to be proposed
However it would be a great mistake to dismiss this compact for community as nothing more than an empty exercise in communitarian rhetoric
For the compact once made can be put to some interesting uses
The epilogue suggests beginning with a campuswide forum to discuss a compact for community proceeding to the compact s ratification by the board of trustees and then using it as a framework within which to evaluate policies and to make decisions on such matters as the appropriateness of new student organizations or the worthiness of existing ones
In short while the compact itself will make little difference administrators can use a compact once ratified to justify actions that might otherwise be resisted by faculty students alumni and parents
The epilogue asks And could student faculty and ado from inviting speakers or entertainment groups to planning courses to academic evaluations and even hiring personnel Yes they could
It behooves us therefore to examine the specific tendencies that the Carnegie Foundation s proposal encourages
Civility and Academic Freedom
Chapter An Open Community addresses one of the most difficult and most discussed issues on campus today namely the need to combat the decline of civility while not infringing on academic freedom and freedom of speech
On the one hand there is an alarming increase in vulgar and abusive speech directed against other persons often employing the most foul language of sexual racial and ethnic disparagement
On the other hand there are attempts by many colleges and universities to curb such speech but in ways that censor the expression of views running counter to the prevailing orthodoxies of the civil rights establishment feminism and the gay rights movement
The Carnegie Foundation takes the position that academic freedom must be uncompromisingly protected but that the latter nevertheless can and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms
""
As stronger feelings are always aroused by violations of substantive values than by violations of procedural values the Carnegie Foundation deserves credit for supporting procedural over substantive values in this case
Nevertheless there are two problems with the Carnegie Foundation s recommendation
The first is that it extends the protection of academic freedom to purely abusive speech personal insult obscene language and racial slurs even if they are entirely unconnected with any expression of opinion
Pure abuse could be subjected to institutional sanction even as the expression of ideas opinions and theories no matter how offensive some of these may be to particular groups is protected
Perhaps the Carnegie Foundation felt that the distinction between pure abuse and offensive opinion was too difficult to draw
But if that distinction can not be drawn then their recommendation is problematic in a second way
For it licenses or even encourages administrative condemnation be distinguished from the expression of opinions some deem offensive then this is also license and encouragement to condemn currently unpopular opinion
Presidential or institutional condemnation is a powerful weapon especially in a small intimate liberal arts college
Therefore those in authority ought not to resort to condemnation lightly
Even to express disagreement is often inadvisable for those in authority when they do express it their disagreement ought to be clearly distinguished from condemnation
Hence a distinction must be drawn between abusive speech which is to be condemned and unpopular speech with which one may at most disagree
This is a matter of some moment as university and college authorities in the past few years often have been guilty of condemning as insensitive or as racist sexist or homophobic speech that at worst takes misguided issue with prevailing views and often presents entirely plausible criticism of those views
There is less need to counsel administrators to condemn abusive speech of unpopular views
The Carnegie report by neglecting these considerations might be misread by some as granting a license to condemn students or faculty who question contemporary pieties
Indeed there is nothing in the report to indicate that would be a misreading
A related omission also detracts further from the virtues of chapter 
While the use of racial and similar slurs is rightly denounced there is no explicit recognition of other classes of terms that are being used offensively on campuses today
For example faculty and students who are very far from being racists but who question the wisdom or justice of affirmative action policies are regularly subjected to public charges of racism by their colleagues
Now in the present climate of opinion where nearly everyone condemns racism there is no more insulting epithet than racist
Furthermore it is the most damaging epithet
A racial slur however much it may wound one s feelings damages the reputation only of he who casts it given credence does enduring harm to a faculty member and very great if only temporary damage to a student
If college and university presidents are to be urged to condemn the use of racial slurs should they not also be urged to condemn the far more frequent and damaging practice of unjustly charging others with racism
The same of course would apply to a string of other epithetsoffavor such as sexist homophobe and fascist
Consider the situation on American campuses almost everyone condemns racism sexism prejudicial treatment of homosexuals and so on while relatively few and those few tend to be drunken studentsare guilty of expressing the prejudices condemned
It therefore requires no courage for a college president or for the Carnegie Foundation to speak out against racial and similar slurs
That is like mounting one s moral high horse in the safety of the stable yard surrounded by helpful stable hands and eager wellwishers
Actually to risk himself will have to ride his steed against the phalanx of those who huff charges of racism sexism and fascism against all those who dare question their opinions
The Carnegie Foundation s less than evenhanded approach to the problem of words used as weapons of assault undermines the effectiveness of what is recommended
For the the breakdown of civility within higher education is not limited to the tiny minority of college students who slur those of another race or sex
It is a pervasive phenomenon
And to attack but one small part of it is likely to make things worse rather than better
I believe we could proceed with much more strength against abusive speech than this report recommends if first we were careful to distinguish abusive speech from the expression of unpopular opinion and second we proceeded against abusive speech in all of its forms
Affirmative Action Affirmed
Chapter claims that a just community is one where diversity is aggressively pursued
This timetables until the number of minorities in higher education at least matches their representation in the population
There is no indication that this must depend on primary and secondary schools first preparing such a proportion of minority students for higher education
Presumably then aggressive pursuit of diversity requires lower standards of admission for minority students
Since most higher education administrators are already vigorously pushing affirmative action programs the Carnegie Foundation is preaching to the converted
The real purpose of the document is to hand the missionaries of affirmative action another argument This is what the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching recommends
But since affirmative action has been going on for some time we already know that it has had some disastrous consequences
These are conveniently ignored in the present report
For example there is no mention of the arguments by John Bunzel Thomas Sowell and others that minority students suffer an extraordinarily high dropout rate probably in consequence of having been enticed to institutions to these students in wasted time and crippled selfconfidence is enormous
It is also a great cost to society which loses the potential contributions of those who could have obtained a respectable education at less demanding institutions
For many of these abused students will not try again
They are the victims of an educational establishment eager to purchase selfapprobation at any cost to those they are pretending to help
Simple decency not to mention professional responsibility requires educators engaged in the aggressive pursuit of minority students to provide remedial education to those who need it
Alas that is rare
And when the authors of this report inform us that the issue is more than access it has to do with the lack of support minority students feel once they have enrolled it is not remedial education they have in mind
Instead it is some undefined form of support keyed to race or ethnicity
Chapter also contains an extended discussion of racial divisions and racial tension on American to cleave together in organizations formed for themselves exclusively and of how those same organizations also exacerbate those divisions and tensions
The difficult issues thus raised are entirely real
Minority students on many campuses do feel a desperate need for social groups within which for a time they will feel less like a minority exhibit
Yet that grouping only makes them more separate from the rest of the student body
The Carnegie Foundation appears unable to decide whether racially and ethnically exclusive student groups are or are not a good thing
The only advice offered is that such groups should reach out authentically to one another
No hint is given as to how that might be done except for the suggestion of a summer retreat in which student leaders can seek a common ground within the six principles set forth in this report
But how can a report that lacks a solution to a problem be a solution to that problem
Having failed to address the real difficulties of minority recruitment serious situation of minority students on American campuses chapter plunges next into curricular matters
Above all colleges and universities should seek to build racial and cultural understanding not just socially but educationally as well
Students should take time in their formal program of instruction to learn about the heritage and traditions of other racial and ethnic groups emphasis in original
The same theme is then developed with respect to women s studies which is lauded for its impressive gains
Once again the preaching is to the converted
Once again familiar ideas already widely enacted are urged
Once again all criticism of those ideas is ignored
There is not even a hint that women s studies socalled multicultural education and other ideologicallyloaded attempts to use the curriculum to reform society have ever been criticized
Because there is no consideration of other views there is no effective defense of the view presented
Since nothing is said to counter the objection that affirmative action and to the underqualified minority students condemned to failure one is left to conclude that this just community will in fact be doubly unjust
The Professionalization of Caring
Chapter on the breakdown of discipline in the academy is important for the information it conveys
But the steps it recommends better lighting escort services emergency phone systems and a strengthened police force are as unremarkable as they are sadly necessary
Seminars on safety date rape and the arts of selfdefense are urged as are new codes of conduct but nothing is said about the causes of this unraveling of campus life
Chapter on the importance of celebrating traditions also offers no concrete suggestions worth discussing
By contrast chapter A Caring Community contains a number of proposals that warrant our attention
That chapter argues for expanded student affairs staff and the support services that such staff are supposed to provide
Student affairs is for students of all ages to receive support especially students on the margins
These professionals are the people who often put a human face on the institution
Many of the students sense that programs created by student affairs staff provide caring outside the classroom
We urge that such services be expanded and well supported by every institution
As well as adding more programs to be run by student affairs staff it is suggested that the offices of these professionals be kept open more hours and even staffed by night shifts of those trained and ready to provide caring
""
When students organize into fraternities and sororities they provide for themselves some of the same emotional support and sense of belonging that student affairs personnel are hired to provide
Yet in this report those organizations are viewed with a hostility illdisguised as suspicion
While problems of racially exclusive black student unions and the like were discussed inconclusively the Carnegie report leaves us in no doubt that fraternities and sororities are especially wrong reasons emphasis added
What those reasons are is not stated
The implication perhaps is that they exclude minorities
But that is no longer true integrated fraternities are now the norm
Yet instead of explaining its dark comment the report hastens onward to complain of the destructive behavior of fraternities
Strangely the evidence collected in the report s survey of student affairs officers conveys an unexpected image of fraternity life
While percent of those officers at liberal arts colleges and percent at all institutions together say that the number of residence hall violations has increased only percent and percent respectively say that fraternitysorority violations have increased
Similarly more regard the severity of residence hall violations to have increased percent and percent than think the same about fraternity violations percent both for liberal arts colleges and for all institutions
These data imply that fraternities and sororities are resisting the erosion of community less ineffectively than student affairs the latter toward the former
The chapter concludes by urging several modifications of the academic program which if enacted would effectively subordinate that program to a social work or a social reform agenda
We urge that all students be encouraged to complete a community service project as an integral part of the undergraduate experience
Students also should be brought in touch with those genuinely in need and through field experiences build relationships that are intergenerational intercultural and international too
In the end the campus should be viewed not only as a place of introspection but also as a staging ground for action
Introspection versus action are those the only alternatives Is introspection a proper description of liberal education What does that description imply about the authors attitude toward the arts and sciences Does its wording reflect the views of scholars and teachers or of some other sort of academic professional
The Carnegie report is graced with a prologue where this true statement may now divided into almost wholly separate worlds and student life concerns have become the province of a separate staff with a dizzying array of services provided
Indeed the array is not only dizzying but distracting
At least it has distracted the authors of this report from the educational purpose of educational institutions
If the services are already so numerous as to be dizzying then why still more Are students really better off being so bountifully cared for Is the apathy and passivity and perhaps the irresponsibility too of today s students all of which are complained of by the presidents and student affairs officers surveyed possibly an effect of these services Those questions are not asked
Instead the driving force behind these recommendations seems to be a desire for a unified program that reintegrates the academic and the nonacademic
In effect it recommends submerging academic work in even more student services and infusing it with yet more emphasis on to imagine alternative solutions that are at least as plausible as that found in the Carnegie Foundation s report
For example one way to reintegrate student life with the academic purpose of colleges and universities would be to return the focus of the academy to academic work
This could be achieved by paring back student affairs staff by returning professors to the classroom and by insisting that students spend more hours on course work
It would help too if colleges maintained high academic standards for admission grading graduation and faculty recruitment and promotion not perverted by nonacademic goals no matter how laudable the latter may be
Just think what would be achieved by even so simple a reform as making professors demand more from their students
Not only would students graduate better educated but they would have fewer empty hours to pass away by drinking and thus not only would the problem of alcoholism be addressed but also the related one of violence including racial violence
Of administrative action and not more administrators which goes against the natural disposition of humans to prefer company over work
The many ways in which the recommendations of chapter serve the interests of university and college administrators should be noted
The community service projects and field experiences will require additional administrative staff since they are forms of education that require administration instead of teaching
The expansion of student affairs staff and student support services even if only to provide for a night shift similarly results in an increase in the number of those who must answer to senior administrators
Now unlike faculty members lowerlevel administrators and other nonacademic staff do not enjoy the protection of tenure
Nor do they have any independent ground to stand upon such as that which a faculty member finds in his academic discipline
Rarely do they have any professional recognition or strength outside of their service to their institution as measured by the senior administrators to whom they report those faculty may derive from their respective studies that might inspire opposition to the president s vision of what higher education is all about
The president at the head of this swelling body of functionaries is like the general of a mighty army overwhelming by sheer numbers the voice and mind of the academic faculty
Thereby he is able to impose his own image on the entire institution
And his prestige and salary too must reflect the number of those whom he commands
Academic Purpose
After all this it is a little difficult to take seriously the opening sentences of chapter We list the principle of educational purposefulness first because it is fundamental to all others and if faculty and students do not join in a common intellectual quest then all talk about strengthening community is simply a diversion
Besides the rest of chapter is as much at odds with those sentiments as are the other chapters
For example in this chapter should learn to cooperate not just compete
Who says so And why Why not let the subject matter dictate the best approach to it Who determined that however much cooperation is to be valued elsewhere it promotes learning Or is it not assumed that it promotes learning But then is learning being subordinated to some other goal indeed to the sort of goal favored by professionals in caring On the basis of the unsupported assumption that college and university professors have some obligation to teach students to cooperate it is recommended that students have at least one small seminar course each semester
Further we urge that all students work together occasionally on group assignments to underscore the point that cooperation in the classroom is as essential as competition
""
Next academic departments are urged to become centers of community but events that cut across departmental interests such as allcollege seminars and forums are also recommended
Berkeley students who Hall and Earlham College whose dining hall tables are often covered with handouts on social issues are singled out for praise
And so on in successive steps away from the curriculum until we are jerked gently back to that topic with the thought that shared intellectual discourse can be achieved most successfully perhaps through a wellplanned general education sequence a core curriculum with coherence
""
Many readers who would otherwise be appalled by this document will agree that the curriculum must illuminate larger more integrative ends
Perhaps however they will come to share my doubts about such grand designs as they reflect on the sort of integrarive ends that are likely to occur to the Carnegie Foundation and those whose thinking it reflects
As it happens the examples cited are nothing very objectionable nor very integrative
One college specifies ten areas of study another eight categories of perspective a third a cluster of courses united by a theme within whose Benign or not these recommendations do not begin to address the problems that chapter began by reciting the fact that students are illprepared for college work do not know how to concentrate and devote very few hours a week to study
In fact the group projects allcollege forums departmental social events and some of the other activities urged therein would serve only further to distract students from their studies
Were this report to address the problems it cites it would speak to the question of whether colleges and universities should expand their programs of remedial education or raise their admission standards
It would provide some suggestions for how administrators could enforce a general increase in the amount of work professors require of their students
And it would consider how to get students to accept that salutary revolution
Since most students these days have a great deal to say about where they go to school and since most colleges are vulnerable to market pressures it will be almost impossible to increase work agree to act in concert
Concerted action of that type is precisely what the Carnegie Foundation is wellpositioned to promote and indeed orchestrate
But such a reform would result in more work for everyone
Furthermore it would not increase administrators role in education it would not slide in on rhetorical unction and it would not cost more money
Therefore it is not a reform likely to be made
Though it fails actually to recommend a change in the reward system by which faculty are now encouraged to devote more of their energies to research than to teaching this chapter s brief discussion of that system and its consequences is one of its more pertinent moments
Herein the educational establishment belatedly recognizes the problem that a journalist so rudely named profscam
Still not deigning to admit that they have read Charles Sykes s book of that title the establishment nonetheless shows signs of having heard from indignant citizens who did read it
Yet one could wish for a wrote this report
For example just as Sykes has been criticized for doing they ignore the distinction between institutions whose first priority is rightly research and those whose first priority ought to be teaching
In addition this report would have been the place to point out that the flight from teaching of which Sykes complained is not purely a scam and is not wholly due to a system that rewards research before teaching
For it is also due to the very problem that this chapter pretends to address
When college students are neither able nor willing to do collegelevel work it is natural for professors to become demoralized and turn their energies away from teaching and into lines of work where they feel they might be more productive
Sixties Communitarianism
The ideas that evidently inspired the Carnegie report are of an unmistakable provenance
Those ideas were they allowed to guide us would lead American education in a direction repugnant to most Americans
Ernest L Boyer the Carnegie Foundation s president says the campus turbulence of the s with mixed emotions
They were times of anger and fear but also of intense yet honest discourse with caring students that revealed what a true community of learning is all about
A community of learning it turns out removes students from libraries and laboratories so that they may participate in teachins
The teachins at their best Boyer says brought faculty and students out of their boxes into forums where larger more consequential issues were considered
""
Let us recall the character of those forums and the consequential issues discussed
Students who had not yet mastered the rudiments of any intellectual discipline presumed to lecture actually to harangue other students and the faculty on complex issues of American foreign policy
Is a community especially a community of learning best modeled on large meetings in which the emotions of many are worked upon by the fanaticism of a few
Yet Boyer regrets that the s His only example of the downside of the sixties is the Kent State shootings
He appears to have forgotten that altruism also led to violence on the part of the altruistic
He has forgotten or chooses to ignore the bombing of the University of Wisconsin computer facility and the many threats of similar bombings
He does not mention the destruction of professors research or the fact that the majority of students who wanted to attend class were often prevented from doing so
The idea in Boyer s foreword and in the report that follows it seems to be to institutionalize this s idea of community and to impose it on today s students since they seem unwilling to create it for themselves
Students today are belittled as more concerned about credentials than confrontation
Does Boyer really mean to recommend confrontation Are credentials so bad Is there nothing between those two alternatives such as the learning that credentials are supposed to represent Throughout this but by invidious comparison to a vaguely communitarian ideal
Serving the educational needs of each student must remain a top priority in higher education but private concerns while important are insufficient the epilogue tells us
Of course they are insufficient if by private concerns we mean something invariably selfish
But is the concern of a student to become liberally educated necessarily selfish Will not that education make him a better citizen Is his concern to learn engineering or nursing or law selfish Will not such studies make him a more valuable contributor to society What further social goals should colleges or universities teach their students Will not the attempt to inculcate those goals interfere with the proper and possibly more important job of educating young people
When the epilogue states that we need educated men and women who not only pursue their own personal interests but also are prepared to fulfill their social and civic obligations it makes it sound as if doing a good job society
But is not the businessman who creates a more efficient way to market his product or to finance his operations also contributing perhaps even more than when he donates some of the resulting profits to a charity Similarly a student who applies himself to his studies is doing the best thing he can be doing not just for himself but for society since he is preparing himself for greater service to society
The communitarian ideal that leads one to denigrate competition private purposes and individual effort also is hostile to private associations voluntarily entered into such as fraternities
In fraternities and sororities students are free momentarily from the influence of the larger institution
One vice chancellor is quoted with approval as complaining that there is a magnetism that tugs at subgroups pulling them away from any common agenda
Well why should there be a common agenda Is it healthy especially in a democracy for the administration or any majority of faculty to impression that the authors of this document are unacquainted with concepts of tyranny of the majority and freedom of association
The desire to achieve unity on campus is only the beginning
Boyer in his foreword concludes that Higher education has an important obligation not only to celebrate diversity but also to define larger more inspired goals and in doing so serve as a model for the nation and the world
Again in the concluding words of the epilogue In our hardedged competitive world more humane more integrative purposes must de defined
And perhaps it is not too much to hope that as colleges and universities affirm a new vision of community on campus they may also promote the common good in the neighborhood the nation and the world
No hard edges here only megalomania
But this New Left cant is only one form that a misplaced humanitarian impulse can take
There is a reason many educational leaders are more interested in humanitarian than in academic public support for higher education and humanitarian goals are unquestionably good albeit easily distorted
The value of a liberal education is harder to define much less defend
Thus it is nor surprising that many of those who speak for higher education resort to the easier argument which makes higher education s purpose humanitarian
The danger is that they will end up believing it themselves
Then as in this report they will begin to insist that academic institutions conform to those arguments and pursue humanitarian goals at the expense of academic goals
Thus they may turn those institutions from their true purpose and in the name of lofty goals make them less useful to society than they have been
We need educational leaders who understand what education is and how it serves society
The Mind of the Blob
Campus Life has no author
As it is issued by the foundation of which he is president Ernest L Boyer clearly bears major responsibility for it yet his name appears only as the author latter he gives credit to a large number of persons from both the Carnegie Foundation and the American Council on Education ACE and says that the project was in every respect a collaborative endeavor of the two organizations
ACE like the Carnegie Foundation represents the views of administrators
It is supported by dues paid by colleges and universities and by various national and regional higher education associations
Those who attend its meetings are predominantly college and university presidents and other senior administrators
Thus this report represents the corporate thinking of the higher education establishment that group that a former Secretary of Education impolitely named The Blob
""
Not merely is it written by those who represent administrators this report is also based on a careful survey of the opinions of administrators and on very little else
Its sixtyeight pages of statistical appendixes consist entirely of two sets of tables one representing a opinion survey of college and university presidents and the other a survey of chief student putatively directed to those same administrators this report reads very much as if one were overhearing The Blob talking to itself
And in fact the tables appended to the report as well as the report s text provide an illuminating glimpse into the mind of higher education s establishment
A comfortableness with contradiction seems to be that mind s most salient characteristic
The report s prologue begins American higher education is by almost any measure a remarkable success yet not long after we are told that students underprepared for college work can graduate after having studied only six hours per week
Similarly colleges and universities are praised for the enormous growth in their student affairs staffs even though that growth has been accompanied by a proportionate decline in civility and learning
This last discrepancy mirrors some very interesting attitudes revealed in the survey of chief student affairs officers
Seventythree percent of those officers at liberal arts colleges believe that the quality of campus life is better percent believe it to be not as good
The past five years as we have seen is a period during which student affairs staffs have grown enormously
Yet the answers of the same respondents to specific questions bearing on the quality of campus life contradict their overall judgment in every particular
Seventysix percent say that alcohol abuse is about the same or worse now than five years ago percent say that drug abuse is the same or worse percent find theft to be the same or a greater problem percent violations of honor codes percent incidents of physical violence percent suicides and suicide attempts percent vandalism percent excessive noise and disruptiveness in dormitories percent racial tensionshostilities percent lack of civility when disputes arise percent sexual harassment percent find rape or sexual assault to be the same or a greater problem now than five years ago and so on
students affairs staffs are larger
The survey of college and university presidents is also sadly revelatory
The presidents were asked to name the most important actions they could take to improve campus life
The highest response rate percent was coded be visible and involved in campus events
The next two most favored responses be accessible and act as a role model were not much different but lagged by twelve and sixteen percentage points respectively
The least favored response was one that above all others requires hard work and tough decisions be actively involved in faculty and staff hiring
Only percent thought such involvement to be important although nothing determines the quality and direction of an institution more than personnel decisions
Other outoffavor alternatives included ensure open discussion of campus issues percent be open to divergent views percent and be knowledgeable of campus services percent
Dare I nation s educational leaders
Since college and university presidents seem to feel their mere totemic presence is more important than anything requiring them either to think or to act it is not surprising that chapter A Celebrative Community lays such emphasis on purely ceremonial occasions
Surely it is pleasant not to have to think or act but simply to personify entire institutions and in elaborate ceremonies receive the honors given them
Why does the Carnegie report ignore all alternative points of view and all the arguments against its favorite nostrums that have been made repeatedly in the public press Why does it not even deign to argue for the prescriptions it recommends Why does it ignore much of the evidence collected in its own surveys Perhaps the answer is to be found in the attitude of college and university presidents according to whom it is of no great importance to ensure open discussion of campus issues to be open to divergent views or to be wellinformed about what is going on chapter A Caring Community seems to have been written by student affairs officers for student affairs officers
It is full of cant phrases like caring and pseudoscientific terms for human relations such as bonding
What happens in the classroom appears to be an utter mystery to the authors
In one place as we have seen they dismiss it as introspection
In another place they refer to it as intellectual bonding
""
The Carnegie report was produced by two large organizations each having enormous resources of personnel talent and experience
It was backed by substantial funds the Henry Luce Foundation chipped in too and based on large carefully conducted surveys that represent the collected wisdom of this nation s top higher education administrators
Why then is this report so egregiously deficient That is a very large question and it is one with most serious implications for the future of higher education

 special report by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching with a foreword by Ernest L Boyer Princeton NJ Princeton University Press xiii and pages of text plus pages of appendixes and notes paperback
By Thomas Short
Thomas Short is associate professor of philosophy at Kenyon College Gambier OH 
Alisdair Macintyre entitled a recent book on ethics and political theory Whose Justice Which Rationality Those questions ought to be asked of teaching in contemporary philosophy courses
Courses on ethics and contemporary moral problems are popular throughout the country focusing on among other things justice
Logic courses if not quite so popular are also perennially full of students
Whose conception of justice and which conception of rationality do these courses teach
We have undertaken a study of recent textbooks on contemporary moral problems and on logic
We have found that overwhelmingly these books adopt a liberal to leftwing political stance
The ethics books imply that liberals or leftists have the stronger arguments on topics ranging from abortion to capital punishment to affirmative action
The logic books suggest that conservative reasoning is routinely fallacious
These findings are disturbing because while for most students one or another of these courses is their first exposure to philosophy for many it is their last
At stake therefore generation will understand not only justice and rationality but philosophy itself
Will students think of philosophy as a open search for truth wherever it lies or as a process of partisan debunking whose goal is to ratify contemporary ideological preferences The Case of Logic Textbooks
Logic seems like a paradigm of an objective apolitical discipline
Despite recent trends in other areas there is no such thing as specifically feminist or deconstructionist logic
There are no leftright disputes concerning logical theory
Nevertheless many logic textbooks reveal a bias against specific thinkers and positions mostly conservative ones
We first began to suspect that the teaching of logic was not immune from politics when a referee criticized a manuscript by one of us for a logic textbook not only for including too few quotations from nonWestern thinkers but also for presenting as an example of fallacious reasoning the following quotation from M Y Latsis chief of Lenin s secret police the Cheka
We are not looking for evidence or The first question we ask is to what class does he belong what are his origins upbringing education or profession These questions define the fate of the accused
This is the essence of the Red Terror 
In just two and a half years the Cheka condemned to death over fifty thousand people not because of any crime but because of their parentage education or occupation characteristics that are surely accidental to the issue of whether they deserved to die
The referee s defense of the Cheka s reasoning shocked us and suggested that politics may permeate logic textbooks more than we had imagined
The focus of our study of logic textbooks were the sections most contain on informal fallacies begging the question arguments ad hominem appeals to force pity emotion and the like
Gerald Massey and others have criticized these sections for their obsession with taxonomy their lack of theory and their shoddy reasoning
Certainly many treatments of fallacy do exhibit them they amount to little more than lists of unrelated mistakes
Here however we want to focus on a different though perhaps related shortcoming
These sections to explain the general kinds of fallacies and to offer students exercises give examples of supposedly fallacious reasoning
We examined ten of the most commonly used introductory logic textbooks containing taken together almost fifteen hundred examples of fallacious reasoning The books vary widely in their use of examples drawn from politics
In one book in our sample only percent of the examples were in any way political and only percent could be construed as partisan
In another percent were political and percent were partisan
We consider an example partisan if it involves a political position often associated with a definite overall political stance
Most political but nonideological examples in our study involved fictional or littleknown local politicians arguing about each other s qualifications ethics and other nonideological matters
""
The degree to which the On average percent of the examples are nonpolitical and an additional percent are political but nonpartisan percent are partisan
These numbers are skewed slightly by the highly political nature of several books
The median figures are percent percent and percent respectively
Typically then about one example in four of fallacious reasoning is in some way partisan
Ideological examples are thus numerous enough to convey a political agenda if they display a systematic bias
Is Conservative Reasoning Fallacious Reasoning
The main methodological problem in testing for such bias is distinguishing liberal from conservative thinkers and positions which if one is searching for a universally applicable test is difficult
Fortunately we found relatively few examples in the surveyed texts hard to categorize
In classifying individual speakers we counted Richard Nixon as a conservative
He is criticized in these books for many things but never for imposing wage and price controls issuing an executive order authorizing affirmative action or is trickier we counted him as a liberal even though he is charged with fallacy almost solely because of his support for American involvement in Vietnam
These two politicians represent the only thinkers whose position on the ideological spectrum was at all ambiguous
Thus if anything we overstate the extent to which liberal thinkers receive any critique at all in certain books
The numbers tell a discouraging tale
Only one text in our sample offers a politically balanced treatment of fallacies
That was the market leader among introductory logic texts Copi s Introduction to Logic which offers a fully balanced approach criticizing arguments for conservative and liberal conclusions equally often
In every other text criticisms of arguments for conservative positions outnumber those for liberal positions by at least three to two and on average by three to one
The political orientation of the partisan examples varies significantly but no textbook indicts liberals more often than conservatives
Overwhelmingly the books suggest to students that fallacious reasoning is characteristic of conservatives In general books in our sample indict conservatives or conservative positions for logical failings three times as often as they indict liberals or liberal positions
It is interesting to compare the frequent criticism of conservative thinkers with the treatment accorded representatives of extremist political positions who lie outside the conventional conservativetoliberal spectrum such as Hitler Stalin other totalitarians and overt racists
Rarely are such extremists charged with fallacy
Only percent of the partisan examples and just percent of the examples overall are of extremist reasoning
Fully half the books surveyed had at most one example of this kind no book had more than six
In no text having more than the median proportion of political examples did those assailing such extreme positions comprise more than percent of the ideological examples
Given the continuing power of totalitarian ideologies to shape world politics and the emergence of racist sentiments on campus the lack of criticism of these modes of thought is unfortunate
Perhaps those responsible for these texts feel it is more important expose the pseudoreasoning of racists and dictators
Ungrounded Criticism
These numbers alone however do not tell the whole story
Other authors have pointed out how some examples of supposedly fallacious reasoning in logic textbooks are in fact perfectly legitimate
Massey for example has discussed texts in which examples drawn from philosophers are unfairly charged with fallacy
We found that some authors also evaluate arguments for conservative positions unfairly
Some putative examples of fallacious arguments by conservatives or for conservative positions are ambiguous others are not fallacious at all
Often the authors seem to forget that in a textbook on logic the point at issue is not the substance of the speaker s position but the quality of his reasoning
Many examples of these faults are contained in Howard Kahane s two muchused logic textbooks from which the following examples are drawn
Example 
What persuades one person may be fallacious for another because people in different places times or circumstances have different sorts of information and theories court systems in the United States dispense justice equally to all on the basis of what teachers and textbooks tell them may not reason fallaciously but any practicing lawyer who is nt blind who believes this has committed a horrendous error 
Kahane s general principle that whether an argument is good or fallacious depends on context is surely correct
But is the example he offers to the point Keep in mind that the point at issue is not whether the court system really is always just but whether particular arguments for that claim are logical or not
Kahane s remarks come in the context of his definitions of cogent and fallacious argument
Has the tenyearold really been persuaded by argument It seems unlikely but if so what argument Without knowing how can we judge whether it is fallacious for either the tenyearold or the practicing lawyer An experienced lawyer who believes that the court system never makes mistakes is naive but has such a person committed a horrendous logical error told what argument has convinced the lawyer In sum Kahane s example illustrates his point so poorly that it seems a gratuitous attack on the American legal system
Example 
General Alexander Haig described the Watergate breakin as improper illegal and immoral an affront to the fundamental values I cherish and we all share
He also said he did nt consider the secret bombing of Cambodia or the Christmas bombing of North Vietnam in the s to be immoral
But when asked about Richard Nixon s role in the Watergate mess Haig replied I can not bring myself to render moral judgment
That s not for me
It s not in me
I ll leave that to others and to history
No one challenged him to nail down this inconsistency 
This is a good example of an ambiguous argument to which Kahane ascribes a very debatable interpretation
If Haig meant that he never makes moral judgments then what he said is false and Kahane s charge of inconsistency is then legitimate
But while Haig interpretation is notoriously difficult in this context it seems likely that Haig was saying he can not make moral judgments about Nixon s role
If that is indeed what Haig meant then he is at least logically consistent whatever one s opinion of Nixon
There is nothing wrong logically or otherwise with making moral judgments on some topics and withholding them on others
Example 
Henry W Block of H R Block the largest income tax preparation company argued fallaciously in a statement against a proposal to simplify federal income tax laws for example to eliminate deductions
There s nothing simple about taxes and never will be
Behind the seductive rhetoric of one tax structure for all are pitfalls that would literally destroy the basic principle of everyone paying a fair share
Block knew very well as every taxpayer should that the principle of everyone paying a fair share of taxes had long
He suppressed this information because a simplified tax law would be a disaster for his business
Again those with little relevant background knowledge are fair game 
Once again the issue is not the merits of tax simplification but whether Block s argument is illogical
It simply is not
Block does not assume that everyone now pays a fair share of taxes but that this principle is an important regulative ideal
He is arguing that fairness requires complexity not that our current system is perfect
In fact it is Kahane not Block who commits a string of logical fallacies in this example
In painting Block as a Pollyanna who believes that the current tax system is always fair Kahane sets up a straw man
Further rejecting Block s argument on the ground that Block stood to profit from tax complexity is a classic instance of a fallacy usually termed a circumstantial ad hominem
Block s personal and financial circumstances are irrelevant to evaluating his argument as virtually every Finally Kahane also seems guilty of what is called ad hominem abusive he insinuates that Block has suppressed this information that is the obscure information that the tax system is sometimes unfair in order to take advantage of those with little relevant background knowledge
Once again these charges even if true are irrelevant to the logic of Block s case
Indeed Kahane s charges are not just irrelevant but silly who does not know that the tax code is sometimes unfair or what H R Block is Once again Kahane s criticisms are so off the mark that lodging an insinuation against a business interest seems to be their only goal
In the following example Kahane s book reproduces a fullpage quotation from an abortion pastoral by Cardinal Cooke with its key phrases about abortion crossed out and references to the Vietnam War handwritten in to replace them
Kahane then comments as follows
Example 
Selective use of principles constitutes a kind sic argued against abortion on the grounds that it is an attack on human life
But the cardinal did not argue against the Vietnam war on these grounds even though it too was an attack on human life 
Let us skip over such obvious points as that the cardinal may have refrained from criticizing the Vietnam War not out of inconsistency but for various prudential reasons and address Kahane s criticism of the cardinal s logic
Kahane s point which is that as a matter of logic abortion and the war in Vietnam are morally comparable and that he who objects to one must logically object to the other is incorrect
The thesis that abortion and the Vietnam War are morally equivalent is morally substantive
That is it is not a matter of pure logic and would require a great deal of specifically moral argument to establish especially since the circumstantial differences between abortion and the Vietnam War are enormous
Moreover even if such a conclusion could be established it nothing he says contradicts it or would be shown irrelevant by it
Kahane might respond that his crossouts show that the cardinal s argument applies to the war just as well as to abortion
But Kahane changes by the Abortion Law of New York State has alienated what the Declaration of Independence calls the inalienable right to life to read by the war in Vietnam the United States has alienated what the Declaration of Independence calls the inalienable right to life
There is simply no logical fallacy in believing the cardinal s statement is true but Kahane s amended version is false whatever one s position on these two contentious issues
Once again it is Kahane not his chosen target who commits the logical errors
First not only does the selective use of principles not constitute a kind of inconsistency but to suggest so is itself a fallacy commonly called accident or misapplication
What is fallacious is to apply principles unselectively
A common example is Plato s question in The Republic Should you return a borrowed weapon to its owner even if he or she requests it in a fit of rage and plans to use it to commit a murder Although we should in general keep our promises it is fallacious to argue from that principle alone to the conclusion that we should return the weapon
This suggests that selective application of principles far from constituting a fallacy is required to avoid fallacy
Kahane himself acknowledges this truth in another part of his text thus leaving him in the position of arguing that selective application of principles is fallacious and that unselective application is also fallacious
The problem here is not Kahane s implicit criticisms of the prolife position or the Vietnam War it is that in straining to criticize the cardinal s reasoning Kahane commits a string of fallacies of his own and this in a textbook on logic
After such a performance we can not resist an ad hominem clear that he opposed the Vietnam War but not Roe v Wade
Presumably he does nt subscribe to the thesis of moral equivalence either
Kahane s books are admittedly an extreme case
In the matter of fallacies he accuses conservatives over liberals by a ratio of more than five to one and his texts are by far the most political in our sample
They are nevertheless widely used
Furthermore most other books we examined suffer from more or less of the same problem
Quite independent of what one s political sympathies may be such bias is objectionable on a host of pedagogical grounds especially when it drives authors to commit the very errors of reasoning that their own texts are supposed to correct
Ideologies and Agendas
Textbooks in contemporary moral problems have a similar anticonservative bias although it manifests itself in a different way
Typically these texts are anthologies offering small bits of moral theory together with articles on various contemporary concerns such as abortion euthanasia affirmative action obligations the issues that appeared most often in our sample 
What strikes one first about these books is that they overlap very extensively they mostly treat the same issues and include many of the same readings on those issues
In general the issues focused on are political issues which itself represents a particular understanding of moral reasoning one which as Christina Hoff Sommers has noted suggests that morality is a matter of supporting the right causes and voting for the right people But our interest here is with the kind of political issues that are considered in these texts
Some of the issues most frequently considered in the texts we examined such as abortion euthanasia affirmative action and capital punishment occupy the attention of people at many points on the political spectrum
But consider the other issues that often appear in order of frequency of appearance obligation to the hungry nuclear deterrence censorship extramarital sex animal rights income redistribution enforcing private morality feminism pacifism and homosexuality
To see how unrepresentative the above issues are consider some of the issues prominent in the public debates of the last two decades all of which have a significant moral component that do not appear on the list busing confrontation versus detente in foreign policy crime drugs education family issues human rights versus Realpolitik Middle East conflict school prayer subsidies taxation trade policy and welfare policy
The selection of issues undoubtedly reflects a desire to avoid messy empirical disputes in economics and other unphilosophical topics
But then again many of the frequently chosen issues such as income redistribution or nuclear deterrence raise similar problems
Apparently those responsible for the texts we reviewed are more comfortable with examining a liberal agenda and prefer not to discuss other concerns
The Most Words and the Last Word
But beyond examining the character of issues that get a hearing we tried to measure whether the liberal and conservative positions on each the main research challenge is deciding objectively what positions count as either liberal or conservative but again in this context there is less to the matter than meets the eye
As we mentioned almost all of the most popular issues are hot political issues with partisans clearly arraying themselves in characteristic positions
Interpreting and classifying the contributions to these texts thus presented no real problem 
A slim majority of presentations on particular issues percent were balanced
However a very significant percentage of presentations percent offered more liberal than conservative voices
By contrast fewer than percent gave a majority to the conservatives
A greater number percent gave only liberal voices
Examining this book by book percent give liberals a majority on at least some issues only percent give conservatives a majority on any issue
Seventyfive percent of the books give liberals a majority on a substantial number of issues
The political orientation of these texts presented on each issue
Who gets the last word The last article in each section has a special rhetorical position the editors suggest implicitly and sometimes explicitly that it ties things together and presents that most sophisticated view of the topic
Overwhelmingly we found the article in that position advances a liberal view
Liberals get the last word percent of the time overall percent of the books surveyed give the liberals the last word a majority of the time
In fact percent give liberals the last word at least percent of the time and percent do so over percent of the time
One text gave liberals the last word in every instance another did so on every issue but one
These figures show that many contemporary moral issues texts are politically biased favoring liberal views over their conservative competitors
But a more varied and more interesting picture emerges when the texts are analyzed issuebyissue
First we considered how many voices the no issue do the books give conservatives a majority more often than they give liberals a majority
Table which lists the issues in descending order of frequency in the texts shows the pattern of majorities issuebyissue
Note that treatments of feminism and homosexuality invariably give liberals a majority most treatments of abortion civil disobedience and enforcing private morality do the same
Liberals enjoy a majority in at least percent of treatments of all other issues with the exception of extramarital sex capital punishment and censorship
Thus on percent of the issues at least onefourth of the textbooks give liberals a majority
The comparable figure for conservatives is percent
""
Looking again at who gets the last word table the results are more dramatic
Liberals get the last word at least percent of the time on almost half the issues
They get the last word every time on extramarital sex enforcing private morality feminism terrorism and homosexuality deterrence and pacifism do conservatives get the last word even percent of the time
These two tests of bias majorities and the last word give different results with respect to some issues but on a substantial number they agree
We can get a more complete picture of how balanced the presentation of moral issues is in these tests if we combine our two tests
Let us assume that an issue receives a onesided treatment if one side gets the last word on it at least percent of the time and the difference between the percentages of texts giving that side a majority and those giving the other side a majority is at least percent
Using these criteria percent of the issues receive a onesided treatment
In each case the one side presented is the liberal side
The issues receiving a onesided liberal slant by both our criteria are abortion obligation to the hungry animal rights income redistribution enforcing private morality feminism social homosexuality
Perhaps not surprisingly the bias is greatest among those issues less frequently treated
Some of this may result from the decrease in sample size for those issues
But some of it surely reflects the place of those issues in a political agenda
Despite the clear story the numbers tell it is hard to feel the strength of the bias in these texts on the evidence of statistics alone
Consider that every text raising the issue of terrorism gives the last word to someone defending terrorism half also give the defenders of terrorism a majority
Or consider this section on sexual morality from one of our surveyed texts PREFORMATTED TABLE
After the reading from the Vatican declaration which presupposes a specifically Catholic religious commitment the only form of sexual activity condemned by any author is rape
Unfortunately as other statistics indicate this kind of onesided treatment is not unusual
The Ethics of Ethics
The statistics we have presented here do suggest a real unfairness in philosophy texts and no doubt conservative being denied equal air time
But the deeper point here is not just about making sure that yet another interest group gets its fair share
Contemporary moral problems presented in anthologies and logic textbooks reflect a deeply disturbing view that goes beyond any particular political opinion
The preponderance of authors and editors seem to think that reason establishes the truth of liberalism that correlatively conservative views result largely from shoddy reasoning
Conservative opinions are implicitly or explicitly labeled unreasonable
The textbooks suggest that anyone who thinks properly about the issues will reach liberal in some cases it seems fair to say radical conclusions
To teach students that is to convey an unfortunate message indeed
For it denies that rational people can reason correctly about many difficult moral and political issues and still reach different conclusions
It denies that we can make progress on such issues by reasoning cooperatively together
And by failing to distinguish between logical and political considerations it discourages students from developing a critical distance on their own convictions
it disadvantages a certain body of opinion but because it betrays the goals of both rationality and justice 
Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of liberty by evilminded rulers
The greatest danger to liberty lurks in the insidious encroachment by the men of zeal wellmeaning but without understanding
Louis D Brandeis
Jean Philippe Rushton holds a research professorship in psychology at the University of Western Ontario
His main interest and the bulk of his work focus on the phenomenon of altruism
Recently a Guggenheim fellow he has also been elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS
Philippe Rushton has served as consultant to the Royal Commission on Violence in the Communications Industry as a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University as a visiting scholar at the Institute of Human Development in Berkeley and as a fellow of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada
Moreover he is the author or coauthor of books and articles or book chapters
On February Rushton added one the former premier of Ontario denounced his work as highly questionable destructive and offensive to the way Ontario thinks and called for his dismissal from the university On February the Toronto Star a leading Canadian paper suggesting that Rushton was a fraud or inept or both labeled as Nazi the Pioneer Fund which supported some of Rushton s work and condemned as racist The Mankind Quarterly a journal in which Rushton had published a single article A month later the Star carried an editorial about Rushton entitled A Weak Response to Academic Fraud along with a cartoon depicting him in a Ku Klux Klan hood
Shortly thereafter in that paper s Easter Sunday editorial the Holocaust and the AntiChrist were linked to an academic at an Ontario University
To add to this storm of damning criticism the dean of social science at the University of Western Ontario Emoke Szathmary declared that Rushton had lost his scientific credibility 
But more Ontario Provincial Police launched an investigation of Rushton questioning other professors at the University of Western Ontario demanding tapes of Rushton s debates and media appearances and later sending a questionnaire about his research to Rushton s attorney to which Rushton was obliged to reply in detail Ontario attorney general lan Scott ultimately declined to prosecute Rushton criminally contenting himself with a public denunciation of Rushton s theories as loony
 Nevertheless not since the days of Joseph McCarthy had a North American s opinions led to such violent criticism nor left him so close to criminal prosecution
What then had Philippe Rushton done to inspire this outrage on the part of the press government officials and the police Rushton s Talk
On January Rushton had read a twentyminute paper at the AAAS meeting in San Francisco during a symposium entitled Evolutionary Theory Economics and Political Science
In this talk and in several other papers he examined data on some sixty variables reported in the groups negroids caucasoids and orientals
The data examined included such traits as average brain size performance on standardized tests evaluations of personality and temperament social behavior speed of maturation sexual habits and fertility
He reached the conclusion that the data clustered in such a way that the racial groups could be ordered according to average variations in these traits
Negroids were on average more fertile faster maturing more sexually active and less accomplished in standardized tests than orientals who tended to the opposite in each trait
Caucasoids regularly fell between the two other racial groups
Rushton then hypothesized that the ordering corresponded to what is familiar to population biologists as the rK scale of reproductive strategy
At one end of this scale are rstrategies which emphasize high reproductive rates and at the other Kstrategies which emphasize high levels of parental investment nurturing
The scale is generally used to compare what are often widely disparate species but the human species
The more K the family the greater should be the spacing between births the fewer the number of offspring the lower the rate of infant mortality the more stable the family system and the better developed the parental care
The more K the person the longer should be the period of gestation the higher the birthweight the more delayed the onset of sexual activity the older the age at first reproduction the longer the life the more psychologically efficient the use of energy the higher the intelligence the more social rulefollowing the behavior and the greater the altruism
Thus diverse organismic characteristics not otherwise relatable are presumed to covary along a single dimension
Because the races differ on many of the K characteristics Rushton hypothesized that orientals are more K selected than caucasoids who in turn are more K selected than negroids
Thus he argued the posited racial differences in behavior may belong in a broader evolutionary context than has rK scale of reproductive strategies on to human evolution
Based on work by E O Wilson and John Bonner among others as well as on studies of genetic distancing drawn from the analysis of DNA sequencing by Stringer and Andrews he suggested that groups that are more Kselected in their reproduction strategy emerged later in the evolutionary process than groups that are less Kselected
Rushton hypothesized that archaic versions of the three populations we call races emerged from the ancestral hominid line in the following order negroids about years ago caucasoids about years ago and orientals about years ago
Such an ordering Rushton argued fit with and explained the way in which the variables he studied were found to cluster among humans negroids the earliest to emerge were least Kselected caucasoids emerging later were next least Kselected and orientals emerging latest were the most Kselected
Of course Rushton did not claim to have established his contentious hypotheses
They may never be them were eventually confirmed they would provide a very powerful explanation of why on average the measured traits distribute themselves among racial groups as they do
The resulting theory would provide an evolutionary explanation of many gross behavioral traits thus achieving two fundamental goals of any science to provide causal explanations of phenomena and to unify separate fields
These are powerful incentives for theory making and have historically driven the work of the best scientists
The Issue of Racism
The dilemmas Rushton s case seems to pose for anyone with a decent regard for both racial justice and free intellectual inquiry are manifold
Even assuming that Rushton has an absolute right to academic freedom many questions need to be asked about him his theory and his critics
One may inquire for example whether such seemingly odd speculations can possibly be the product of competent scholarship or whether if so they are morally defensible
So far almost all the criticism has been leveled on normative and political grounds attempting hope to demonstrate here that they are neither and more generally that academic cases of what seem to be genuinely racist theorizing are best dealt with by subjecting them to rigorous scientific debate and review rather than through the application of political or legal pressure
I believe that the facts will also show that while the validity of Rushton s conjecture is very far from having been demonstrated his work constitutes a legitimate exercise by a competent scholar and does not deserve the abusive treatment it has received
But before we consider Rushton s work on scholarly grounds we have to confront headon whether it is racist on its face
The essence of racism lies in the belief that people of a certain racial group should be accorded less respect or fewer rights than are given others solely because of their race
By this clear test nothing Rushton says is racist
To begin with Rushton goes out of his way to emphasize that since there will be great differences among individuals in each population group impossible to draw soundly even in principle
Here he parts company entirely with those theorists who argue that race is the best available predictor of an individual s intelligence or character
Rushton is perfectly clear that his is not a theory of individual variation
It must be emphasized that there is enormous variability within each population
Since the distributions overlap it is always problematic to generalize from a group average to any particular individuals Recall that only of the variance is genetic on his hypothesis and that is due to the environment
Even the genetic effects are necessarily mediated by neuroendocrine and psychosocial mechanisms 
At the level of the individual it must be recognized that almost all will have a mixture of r and K characteristics 
It is also crucial that Rushton does not claim his hypothesis generates any social legal or political policies
Indeed he says nothing about policy or politics at all
If Rushton argued that on the basis of his hypothesis blacks should be discriminated against of racism
But he says no such thing
This brings us to the questions of the validity of Rushton s thesis and his scholarly competence Regarding the validity of the hypothesis the fact is that no one neither Rushton nor his critics knows for certain whether it is true or not But and this is a crucial point a scholar need not establish the truth of his theories before he has a right to express and disseminate them
The point ought to be obvious for several reasons
First of all even truths now universally accepted such as heliocentrism were uncertain and sometimes highly controversial when new
Thus if academic freedom were reserved only for the propagation of unquestioned or even likely truths scientific and scholarly inquiry would come to a halt
In fact as everyone with experience in the academy well knows scholars working on subjects less controversial than race may propagate opinions that are not only obviously untrue but positively ludicrous without having their academic freedom to be of this type he has as much right to express them and as much a claim to civil treatment as do provocative eccentric or merely unorthodox scholars working in other fields
The proper intellectual standard to apply in cases such as this where the issues are whether academic freedom and civility are due ought not to be Is this work absolutely true but rather Is this work the product of competent scholarship Just as physicians and lawyers are properly censured or even deprived of their professional status not when wrong but only when clearly inept so too censure of Rushton would be merited only if his theory were the product of incompetent scholarship
Moreover the dismissal of a respected and tenured researcher could only be justified upon a showing of failure of competence in many lines of his work 
Rushton and others have discussed many of the objections to his theory including the following the correlations between many of the variables old and poorly ascertained at least some of the correlations may be explained by environmental factors there are mammalian species that do not fit the projected pattern both human sexual mores and achieved fertility are notably variable features fertility itself is not known to be heritable and the data on DNA sequencing upon which Rushton relies may be incorrect
Naturally Rushton believes he has sufficient answers to the objections
Whether this is true or not however can not be our concern
That has to be left to a scientific consensus that will emerge from the research published in refereed journals
The question rather is whether Rushton is honestly trying to respond to such objections and is displaying adequate scholarly competence in doing so
In this connection it is only fair to mention that all of Rushton s work has been found convincing enough not merely to merit publication in refereed journals but to gain for him those distinctions mentioned above
What is more he has developed his theories and responded to scientific criticism in a manner befitting the scholar he is
However controversial or incorrect his ideas may turn out to be they are simply not the product of an intellectual incompetent or a racist
Despite this Rushton s competence continues to be the target of many attacks none of them convincing
In the January issue of the Toronto Star under the subhead Race Superiority Theories Pure Hokum Scientists Say reporter Lynda Hurst challenged Rushton s scholarship on the ground that his assumptions about the relative dating of the emergence of the races were based on an article reporting DNA sequence findings published in a supposedly popular unscholarly journal Science
Hurst records a University of Western Ontario geneticist Joseph Cummins as saying that contrary data would be forthcoming in the January issue of a professional publication the American Journal of Human Genetics
Unwary readers might be expected to miss the fact that this data would appear after Rushton s talk and well they conflicted with the Science artide it would have been impossible for Rushton to have taken them into account
Moreover Science the official weekly of the AAAS is in fact a highly regarded and fully refereed journal
The implication that data published in this journal are less reliable than data published elsewhere is false
Some commentators have branded Rushton an incompetent because many of the scientists whose data he used disagree with his interpretation of their work But scientists who gather data are not the final arbitrators on the interpretation of those data
Rushton took his data as he found it in the literature
Copernicus who did not make his own observations did the same when he took his data from his ancient predecessor Ptolemy which he then used to overturn Ptolemy s geocentric theory of the solar system
Rushton is simply in disagreement with many of his datagathering scientific colleagues and such disagreement is not a sign of intellectual failure
Writing in Mill put the case for Liberty
We can never be sure the opinion we are endeavoring to stifle is a false opinion and if we were sure stifling it would be an evil still Those who desire to suppress it of course deny its truth but they are not infallible
They have no authority to decide the question for all mankind To refuse a hearing to an opinion because they are sure it is false is to assume that their certainty is the same as absolute certainty
All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility
Only through free speech could one reach even provisional truth
And it was clear to Mill as it should be to us that truth is a good and desirable thing especially in the university
There is no other raison detre for the life of the mind
And there can be no life of the mind without free inquiry into truth
There is another reason for free speech which Mill did not consider Quis custodiet ipsos custodes Who can be for what reasons We have too much experience with censorship to entrust such power to anyone
This remedy has always proven far worse than any alleged disease it was supposed to cure
Mill famously thought he found a natural limit to free speech the point at which it caused palpable harm
His examples show he took that point to be roughly where American law for the most part today draws the line at the point where speech becomes action in conspiracy or incitement or in cases such as libel where the speech itself creates clear direct or measurable damage
Now the university is the place of all places where truth is sought
But truth is neither always recognized as Mill noted nor always palatable
It often offends
As Huxley said with only some overstatement every scientific truth begins as heresy
Academic freedom and freedom of speech are empty concepts if they are held to protect only speech that is acceptable to most people
Such speech needs no protection
Only that because that is the only speech censors wish to suppress
It is precisely such speech that academic freedom is designed to protect
Now speech in pursuit of scientific scholarly or philosophic truth is hardly likely to contribute either to conspiracy or incitement
If the university is to have any real task such speech must remain free
Realizing this John Dewey and A O Lovejoy founded the American Association of University Professors and fought for the establishment of academic freedom and tenure
No one in the academy ought to have to fear voicing controversial or unpopular views
No one ought to be at risk for his ideas
Dewey s influential student the late Sidney Hook defined academic freedom as the freedom of professional qualified persons to inquire discover publish and teach the truth as they see it in the field of their choice without any control or authority except the control or authority of the rational methods by which truth can be established 
The conditions of appointment of the University of Western Ontario
The essential functions of a university are the pursuit creation and dissemination of knowledge through research and other scholarly activities and by teaching
These can not be performed without academic freedom which ensures the right of every faculty member regardless of rank or status to teach investigate and speculate without deference to prescribed doctrine
Just so
And the Model Clause on Academic Freedom of the Canadian Association of University Teachers states its principles thus
The common good of society depends upon the search for knowledge and its free exposition
Academic freedom in universities is essential to both these purposes in the teaching function of the university as well as in scholarship and research
Academic staff shall not be hindered or impeded in any way by the university or the faculty association from exercising their rights as citizens nor shall they suffer any penalties because of the exercise of such legal rights
The parties agree that they will not infringe or abridge the academic freedom of any member of the academic community
Academic doctrine to freedom in carrying out research and in publishing the results thereof freedom of teaching and of discussion freedom to criticize the university and the faculty association and freedom from institutional censorship
Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the individual
Rather academic freedom makes commitment possible
Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research and teaching in an honest search for knowledge
Finally the Canadian Constitution Act of contains a Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom
Section reads
Fundamental Freedoms
Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms
a Freedom of conscience and religion
b Freedom of thought belief opinion and expression including freedom of the press and other media of communication
c Freedom of peaceful assembly and
d Freedom of association
Under these three admirable Canadian documents Philippe Rushton should have been left free to promulgate his views Given that Rushton s scholarly standing is in good order what does the whole episode say about the state of academic freedom in Canada and perhaps more generally First consider the shocking fact that Rushton has been the subject of a lengthy inquiry not by his scholarly peers alone but by the police
The Ontario Provincial Police conducted a sixmonth investigation of Rushton seeking to determine whether he had violated the federal criminal code of Canada chapter C paragraph which reads in its relevant part Every one who by communicating statements other than private conversation willfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of a an indictable offense and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years emphasis added
After a detailed examination of his evidence originality qualifications methods and so forth the distinguished scholars of the provincial police came to the considered conclusion that it is the overwhelming opinion of academics questioned that misinterpreted andor questionable source data
This has resuited in your presentation to the AAA sic falls noticeably short of expected professional standards
 In sum the provincial police officially assessed the question of whether Rushton might be subject to two years in prison for such actions as using questionable source data and then very graciously held that while incompetent his work did not constitute a federal offense
Even supposing the darkest interpretation of Rushton s work were true can anyone with the slightest respect for academic or intellectual freedom assume that a police investigation and the possibility of imprisonment constitute acceptable responses If academic freedom means anything it must at least mean freedom from prosecution
Yet in Rushton s case even this most elemental standard has been violated in the name of antiracism
Only slightly less destructive of the ideals of academic freedom have been the actions of the University of Western Ontario which has given Rushton a formal negative evaluation deprived him of a usually pro forma pay increase and taken
At the University of Western Ontario even tenured full professors are evaluated annually to determine among other things pay increases and promotions A committee of seven members of the Department of Psychology judged Rushton unsatisfactory for 
The committee wrote to Rushton that his unacceptable scholarly performance in race differences outweighed your obvious productivity and the commendable character of other work
Should Rushton receive three such unsatisfactory ratings in a row his tenure would be revoked
In any case he was deprived of a considerable chunk of his salary increase
The University of Western Ontario also launched two separate investigations into the ethics of Rushton s experiments with students both on and off campus and managed to convict him of minor breaches
The university also threatened to monitor his classes beginning with the Fall semester 
It is important to note that the committee s actions despite its abovequoted statement appear to be based not on Rushton s scholarship but on dislike of Rushton s theory on racial differences
The committee inadequate
In any case even if that work had been shown faulty there was enough other work more than percent of his output for that year devoted to other subjects
Indeed in Rushton had been awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship and had more scholarly entries on his annual report than any other member of his department
One British colleague wrote that Rushton annually had more research published in high quality journals than many entire British psychology departments Given such a record of scholarly accomplishment can it possibly have been fair to take such severe steps because of the publication of a highly controversial theory Again if academic freedom affords any protection it surely must protect an obviously able scholar from official censure for simple controversy
Even the procedures used to judge Rushton do not seem quite fair
Dean Szathmary denied Rushton s appeal from his departmental rating of unsatisfactory
But she had already declared publicly that he had no scientific credibility left
Moreover members of his departmental first appeal which they then went on to deny All of them ought to have recused themselves none did
In correspondence Dean Szathmary sought to defend her actions with the novel claim that her remarks on Rushton s scientific credibility were made in her professional capacity but her denial of his appeal was made in her entirely different capacity as dean presumably suitably insulated from professional contamination prosecutor and judge in one 
In addition Rushton s department is attempting to require him to teach his large lecture sections this fall on videotape which is again a denial of his academic freedom Apart from the unacceptability of such a requirement Rushton will be deprived of his teaching assistant for grading because she will be needed to meet preceptorially with his students after his videotaped lectures
The Politics of Scholarship on Race
On the basis of his scholarly competence and right to academic freedom Philippe Rushton should have been left free to promulgate his views without obstruction subject only to genuine scientific criticism
But he called upon in public to defend not merely his ideas but his personal and professional integrity
He has been denounced on national television to his face as a neoNazi
His graduate students have been advised to seek other mentors
Colleagues who have not read his work abuse him
Collaborators have requested the withdrawal of their names from articles already in press and which have nothing to do with the subject of hypothetical race differences
What ideas of justice and civility can legitimate a campaign against Rushton of such intensity
Rushton s more articulate critics justify their tactics as follows
First they claim that the theory is not true and that academic freedom only protects the truth But we have already considered this argument and only add now that such a standard would even have failed to protect Galileo against the Inquisition for strictly speaking his theories were false as were all the leading astronomical theories of the time
Second as David Suzuki a geneticist and broadcaster associated with the televised debate with Rushton In a society in which racism is rampant it is not sufficient for a scientist to say I am merely giving you truth
Suzuki s doctrine is more subtle and so more dangerous
In what sense is it not sufficient for a scientist to give the truth as he sees it Can the truth or even an honest effort to approximate the truth be somehow harmful or racist as Suzuki s statement seems to imply Obviously scientific ideas as ideas can hardly be harmful in themselves and it is sheer hyperbole to call a scientific theory racist
Nor does the lamentable fact that racism continues to exist require scientists as scientists to scrutinize their findings for whether they offend against this or that political ideology
Scientists of course can not guarantee their work will never be used for evil that is a task society as a whole must undertake
And in fact society is moving though perhaps too slowly against racism
not when rule and oppression are most severe but rather when things are getting better
There is certainly more than a little irony that in an era when race problems have been openly acknowledged and race relations have greatly improved at least in the Western world we are informed that racism is so rampant that scientists must practice selfcensorship
Once it was North American liberals and leftists who fought honorably for the principle of free speech and academic freedom
Now all that has changed
As the Rushton case illustrates most leftists and too many who call themselves liberal seek to punish those whose speech offends them
For such persons free speech and academic freedom are no longer questions of principle everything is merely a matter of whose ox is gored
They would do themselves well to rediscover the meaning of traditional liberal ideals before the climate of opinion changes and they are on the receiving end of a witch hunt such as Rushton has experienced 
On April the New York Times reported that Dr Joel Segall president of Baruch College of the City University of New York was resigning from his job following a critical review by the Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges
There was no allegation that Baruch was anything less than an excellent college
In fact it is widely regarded as one of the four top business colleges in the country and trains almost one out of every three of the certified public accountants working in New York
Rather the complaint was that there were not enough minorities in the faculty and administration and that not enough minorities graduated
Disturbing though this is even more unsettling is the fact that the criticism was concocted by the central offices of the accrediting agency acting independently of its own guidelines and evaluation team
While it contained some criticisms of Baruch s curriculum the public report issued by the evaluation team itself was on the whole quite positive
The mentioning ethnic tensions and the lack of minorities on the faculty
The report did not state that accreditation was to be withheld or deferred because of these matters
According to procedure commonly followed in accreditation Baruch was given an opportunity to submit a statement answering the criticisms in the team s report
Following the college s response a still confidential letter from Sarah Blandshei the chair of the Middle States Association is said to have indicated that accreditation would be deferred because of the minority attrition rate and the lack of minorities in the administration and faculty
Dr Howard L Simmons executive director of the Middle States Association acknowledges that under his leadership the agency has undertaken a new activist role
He has asserted according to a recent issue of Black Issues in Higher Education that all universities must be made responsible for the success of minorities in higher education In order to do this Simmons said in an interview the faculty and administration the student body
 This is part of a broad initiative by Simmons
According to published reports fifteen to twenty other institutions have also been threatened on these grounds by the association Baruch s is only the first case to become public
The attack on Segall and the Baruch faculty represents an ominous direction taken by accreditation
For the first time an accrediting agency is criticizing the ethnic composition of a college s graduating class as well as making specific complaints about the racial makeup of its faculty and staff
According to a source on the Department of Education s National Advisory Committee on Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility such a step is entirely unprecedented
No other accrediting agency has ever undertaken an aggressive role in attempting to impose racial quotas on faculty administrators and graduates
In itself the attempt to control the ethnicity of university personnel is nothing new
In the last twenty years the concept of affirmative action has evolved into a quota system in which white males are routinely article in the American Scholar Although deeply threatening to the integrity of the university because they undermine the concept of professional peer review quotas imposed on personnel committees have been a long time aborning and it does not appear that they will be easily abolished
Until recently however the federal government was the principal agency in this coercion
Now it appears the effort has shifted from government to private agencies such as Middle States accompanied by the notion that henceforth a college may have its accreditation withheld if it does not graduate the right percentages of certain ethnic groups
A Racial Graduation Quota
When asked if a college could be found delinquent for failing to graduate sufficient numbers of minority students Simmons agreed that Middle States does use an outcomesbased approach for granting or withholding its approval
He denied that Middle States has any hard and fast rules regarding minority retention rates indicating there is never a single standard in assessing a school s performance in this from Characteristics of Excellence in Higher Education Standards for Accreditation the handbook used by Middle States
In fact there is no statement whatsoever in that manual concerning minority retention rates
When this was pointed out Simmons changed his mind and said that accreditation is granted or withheld on a casebycase basis
I know that sounds hard to understand he admitted but that s how they do it
The team decides differently for each school
There are so many factors involved that there can be no quantitative standards for evaluating a college
So much for the objective criteria of accreditation
What is particularly bizarre about Simmon s line of reasoning is the fact that students at Baruch regardless of racial and ethnic identity generally have a much better chance of graduating than elsewhere
Of white freshmen at Baruch percent graduate in four years compared to a national average of percent percent of black freshman graduate in four years compared to graduate in four years compared to percent nationwide Only Hispanics a particularly heterogeneous group whose actual composition varies greatly by region do slightly less well percent at Baruch and percent nationwide
""
Apparently not only have the criteria for minority retention been invented for the occasion by Middle States headquarters but the true numbers have been ignored
It is likely that the criteria are kept deliberately vague in order to increase the arbitrary power of the accreditors
The use of an unstated but de facto racial graduation quota puts university administrators in a vulnerable position since there is no way to tell whether Middle States will charge them with not having satisfied the goal of graduating sufficient numbers of designated minority groups
The lack of precision permits Middle States to deny that they are seeking any exact outcome thereby avoiding legal action
At the same time when it suits them they can use the outcomesbased approach as a potential threat to colleges seeking accreditation
real racial graduation quota residents and deans will be inclined to design programs to increase graduation prospects for protected groups
Middle States can thus obtain the desired outcome without ever having to invoke the threat explicitly and all the while remain protected from public scrutiny
Simmons admits having adopted the same tactic with many other institutions but because of the secrecy involved in the accreditation process he has not had to be held publicly accountable
However in this he may have violated federal regulations
The Department of Education has criteria for recognition of accrediting agencies one being that an agency not mislead the public regarding an institution s or program s educational effectiveness
 Can Whites Teach Blacks and Vice Versa
The other criticism leveled against Baruch is that is does not employ enough minorities
In reality this argument is absurd since many Baruch professors are Jewish and nonwhite Asians
But in educationspeak such individuals are not defined as minorities
Middle States nonHispanic whites and not enough blacks for a student body that includes many blacks and Hispanics
Thus the broader question at issue is whether or not white instructors can adequately teach minority students
The diversity of a student body according to Middle States must be matched by a corresponding diversity of faculty and administrators
This belief is so widespread amongst academic administrative cognoscenti that few question it
When the logic of such a concept is challenged the usual response is that a white professor can not be as good a role model for a black student as a black professor
In fact there is little or no systematic evidence for this argument
In social psychology the notion of role model is correctly applied to the basic socialization of children when explaining how in childhood we identify with others particularly parents siblings and peers and choose certain persons particularly those of the same sex on whom to model ourselves
may be as likely to deidentify or want to be the opposite of a peer or a sibling or a parent
It is also highly questionable whether this process takes place after puberty
At most therefore while one may suggest that professors can serve as inspirational mentors to college students no evidence exists that such individuals must be of the same sex race or cultural background
The idea of role model in short is fraudulently applied in the field of higher education
Indeed if such a concept did make sense it would have exactly the opposite results of what Middle States ostensibly desires
It would mean not only that black students should be counseled to take courses only from black professors but also that white students should not take courses from black professors
If black students need black professors as role models to spur them to greater levels of achievement white students require and deserve the same kind of encouragement
Taken to its logical conclusion the racial segregation in higher education
If black students respond best to black professors they ought to maximize their chances by enrolling at allblack colleges
The same would apply mutatis mutandis to white students
Another justification for the use of racial quotas in hiring is the suggestion that white professors are somehow harder on black students
As closet or unconscious racists white faculty are according to this argument responsible for the higher dropout rate of blacks
In point of fact there is no evidence for greater white professorial bias against black students
Dr June ONeill a former member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and professor at Baruch s Center for Business and Government has done extensive research on the determinants of black and white high school students achievements when they are young adults
Black students who have black teachers tend to do less well in terms of verbal aptitude but this is because black faculty tend to be less well prepared
By itself a teacher s It is doubtful however that Simmons and his allies are inspired by evidence or logic
There is no reason to believe that much reflection was done on the scientific basis for their criticisms and suggestions
Rather than call for measures that will actually improve the quality of education at the institutions they investigate they seek symbolic moves that produce positive media images
Future Implications of Accreditation Quotas
In the classic accreditation process institutions are evaluated on the basis of the stringency or laxity of their educational standards
In the past if a college was found to be too lax accreditation was withheld or perhaps conditionally granted pending correction of certain deficiencies
But now for the first time a college s accreditation has been deferred not because its standards are too low but because they are too high
An institution of higher learning is being directed to arrange its faculty administration and curriculum so that a de facto racial graduation quota can be filled
Aside from some serious issues the abolition of institutional autonomy and faculty control over the hiring process
It is no coincidence that this new and arbitrary direction has been taken by a private accrediting agency
In the Supreme Court issued a series of decisions that seriously undermined the ability of government to require institutions to use racial and sexual quotas in hiring and promotions
Though this was a serious setback for those who would like to see a political system governed by racial and sexual entitlement they have evidently regrouped
For example under the sponsorship of Senators Kennedy and Hawkins the Civil Rights Bill of currently being argued in Congress would reimpose on employers the burden of proving that they did not discriminate against minorities in hiring
Since it is virtually impossible to prove that something has not occured the result will be that employers including colleges and universities will be obliged to adopt quotas in hiring in order to forestall potential lawsuits
This is particularly likely because the same legislation will require employers to pay the cost of employees discrimination free of charge
On the level of academic rhetoric the tactic has been to substitute diversity for the nowtainted affirmative action since it is widely recognized that the latter has produced discriminatory preferential hiring
Surveys show that most blacks as well as most whites are opposed to preferential treatment for blacks
Using diversity sounds better because the term is vague and it is hard to say one is against it
But the Baruch case shows what diversity truly means it is simply old wine in new bottles
That there is no logical or empirical justification for racial quotas in hiring or graduation should not need saying
But Simmons and his allies are not governed by logic or facts they are driven by a sense of moral righteousness that is impervious to any argument
Rather than conforming to consistent and objective standards of excellence Simmons makes up the rules as he goes along
Rather than appealing to the intellect Simmons tugs at people s basest education
Recently I read a fine article by Prof Walter Berns called The Core as an Education for Natural Aristocrats see Academic Questions Summer 
It s a Jeffersonian idea and I agree with it but for some reason I find that I spend much more time worrying about that oxymoron the natural bourgeoisie than about any kind of aristocracy natural or conventional
It s true that students at liberal arts colleges even in Ohio have a kind of aristocratic assurance that their lives will be successful and that they will do important things in the world
Also they tend to enjoy something of the highminded innocence of the wellreared and protected which encourages them to love learning for its own sake rather than for material utility
But to belabor the obvious above all they are creatures of liberal democracy and as such irredeemably bourgeois
They pretend to be relativists but are really believers in rights and individual responsibility
Underneath the hightoned moralism the lives they will lead when they graduate will overwhelmingly be bourgeois lives composed of the usual professional and commercial careers condominiums divorces therapies and retirements
Of course not only do liberal educators know this but on the whole it drives them wild
As we all know by and large liberal arts professors belong to that strain of the bourgeoisie which dislikes itself hence the really powerful intellectual movements on contemporary campuses are all characterized by bourgeoisbashing
What holds humanistic ie aesthetic Nietzschean Marxism together is hatred of the human products of commercial republics
Feminism which in the larger society has strong elements that are irreproachably bourgeois wages equality selffulfillment in the prestigious universities is magnetized to utopian antibourgeois speculations about overcoming the tyranny of gender or patriarchy
Deconstruction despite and indeed because of its air of a political cool mocks the square epistemological naivete of workaday life
The crusade against the dominance of Western students to something really exotic and thus to destroy their bourgeois complacency
Pedagogical politics is thoroughly antibourgeois whether it is engaged in purifying democracy of its bourgeois taint or creating idealists who are to work for a better nonbourgeois and perhaps nonliberal world
Yet there is something paradoxical and selfdefeating to the point of comedy in the way this all works out
To understand this one has to remember why the bourgeois got such a bad reputation in the first place
This is not selfevident
In certain passages Adam Smith for example glorifies the honesty straightforwardness and independence of the bourgeois
Where the courtly spaniel fawns and begs for a bone of patronage the manly bourgeois plunks his hardearned money down and trucks for his wherewithal
There are still some students like this mostly economics majors who simply can not be made to feel guilty about maximizing their utilities
Still most of the students I see resemble the bourgeoisie Rousseau denounces and Moliere lampoons a bourgeoisie intimidated by aristocratic the bourgeois is a creature of cities but not really a citizen just a lover of private life peace and commerce
Alienated from his original human nature as a happy sappy witless beast he has not achieved a coherent second nature
That is why the natural bourgeoisie is an oxymoron the bourgeois is convention incarnate
This makes him extremely nervous and he lives like Moliere s M Jourdan according to the opinions of others
His natural selflove sours into amour propre poisoned by fears about his neighbors judgment of his lawn his car his politics and his soul
The vice of vanity constitutes his inner life
He wants to be liked even if not wellliked if only someone will tell him what rules to conform to
In the end most do not go as far as M Jourdan most do not try to transform themselves utterly into aristocrats or as is more typical today proletarians or bohemians
But mostly the conscience
I find that students fit the pattern pretty well
The smugness which their teachers find so exasperating is only an attitude struck for lack of a better and easily gives way to selfcontempt and cynicism
Last year I heard the actress Jody Foster recently graduated from Yale interviewed on a morning news show
The interviewer asked Ms Foster if playing a rape victim in a film had enabled her to relive the real victim s plight
Of course not came the reply to imagine that would just be bourgeois
I gather from this that Ms Foster had learned her lessons well at Yale
She had learned that bourgeois is a synonym for philistine fake and vulgar
But did learning this make her less bourgeois She may think so but to judge by the students I see she would be wrong
Contempt for the bourgeoisie is in fact a classic and unattractive bourgeois trait that today s liberal education tends merely to aggravate
frequently assumes the character of a pathological passive aggressive relationship
On the surface one parmer constantly exhorts denounces and edifies while the other heaps ashes on his head confesses and grovels
Really however the apparent victim in this case the student remains quite untouched absorbs the critique into a preexisting pattern of selfblame and determination to resist and often succeeds in revenging himself in typical passive aggressive ways by constantly offering hope of reform and constantly frustrating it
Real liberal education is thus twice blocked first by the genuine though hidden resentment felt against what liberal education appears to be and second by the students delusions that they have overcome their bourgeois limitations when they have merely intensified them
Of course the question Rousseau raises about the bourgeois is a version of the question we are treating here
There is indeed something defective about the bourgeois as a citizen precisely because of his irony and anxiety which are inextricably attached to his privatism bourgeois wavers between gestures of commitment and gestures of cynicism between bursts of indignant enthusiasm for drugs today against them tomorrow and retreats into passivity
The middle position between these gestures which knowing themselves as gestures are also done in bad faith is a moderation essentially helpless unguided by principle
Argument can lead nowhere Should we interfere with other governments No
What about South Africa That s different
Should we protect freedom of speech Yes
What about racist speech Well
It seems to me that ever since Rousseau there has been a great emerging argument in the West about how to ennoble and edify the bourgeoisie
Humanist Marxists socialist communitarians teachers of republican virtue and even though secretly I think the overtly unedifying literary critics are all engaged in the task
Of course as Allan Bloom has reminded us liberal education always must balance against the prejudices of the regime partly for the sake of the regime but mostly may not understand itself as essentially or primarily edifying
Yet it seems to me that under current circumstances the argument between thought for its own sake and for political and moral edification is largely moot
This is because as far as I can tell all efforts at edification are failures on their own terms precisely because they are sensed however dimly as efforts at edification rather than real education
The contemporary version of antibourgeois moralizing fails with particularly comic aplomb because it plays right into those bourgeois traits it seeks to overcome
But the more serious nineteenthcentury version which had its roots in German classicism s project of aesthetic education failed as well
Unlike contemporary moralism which conceals itself as openmindedness the nineteenthcentury version sought to combat meanspirited anxiety directly
By holding heroic examples to the bourgeois for inspection and emulation the bourgeois was supposed to become nobler his vulgar tastes refined his selfregarding passions generously extended
In Schiller s Don Carlos written years before he developed the theory practice we have the classic test case
The play s apparent hero the Marquis Posa is a good eighteenthcentury liberal set in despotic unenlightened times
He is presented as both noble and democratic a citizen of the world and a loving friend a model to the highminded young of the new more egalitarian world
But a careful reading of the play shows Posa to be a far more ambiguous character than his edifying appearance a bad friend and an incompetent politician motivated by vanity
The true greatness of the play depends on that more careful reading
Yet Schiller s intent seems to have been to allow the edifying moralizing reading to be generally accepted
The consequence was that the nobility of the example became unreal
Posa and other Schillerian heroes became hollow plaster casts of classical statuary which could be filled with any political content
Hence those horrible monographs one can still find in card catalogs on Schiller the Nationalist Schiller the Socialist Schiller the National Socialist
The ennobled understood it to be a gesture devoid of content
Hence in part the failure of high German culture to create a sufficiently responsible politically decent bourgeoisie a failure betokened in many old war movies by the figure of the sensitive pianoplaying German officer who still justly gets shot at the end
The most edifying education that middle class Americans can receive it seems to me is the one that is the least overtly edifying the least concerned to hector them or remake them the one that is most concerned with setting out the matters of fact about themselves and the world
Trivial though this suggestion may appear its implications may not be
What would such an education look like It would share with the contemporary diversity movement the goal of letting students understand that their habitual customs and tastes are not simply natural but a product of prior choices that they must either affirm or reject
That means it would have to make available to them the Other way
Starting with a polemical animus against what the students presumably are one teaches a wide variety of texts taken out of the context of highly developed cultures which are then made comprehensible by a hopelessly Western if antibourgeois analysis
The result is gesture and costume
Like those Nobel Hurons and Compassionate Pashas the eighteenthcentury Enlightenment loved so dearly the student sees the Other dressed in exotic garb but he is really looking in the mirror and all he ever sees is himself
Thus he thinks he is learning nonWestern values when in fact it is only in a particular part of the West that faiths are thought of as values
Because he does not know himself he can not know the Other and thus can not know himself through the Other
Adding Fanon to the canon in no way rescues students from the grasp of Dead White European Males it merely adds a couple of outfits to the great historical fashion show to go with say the guitar of The alternative would be to start with the West not tormented by the bizarre dogma that everyone from Aristotle to Augustine was really just confirming the goodness of the American status quo
There students discover versions of the good human types which both distress and attract them honorloving warriors contemplationloving philosophers Godfearing prophets and mystics serious warlike relativists irrationalist scientists
They come to see for themselves what they are what their lives are and generally will be like
As they reflect on their own responses to the arguments they are faced with they come to understand the bourgeois not as a historical accident or as Ms Foster was taught a social solecism but as the product of a very serious choice that has its strengths and limitations
On this basis they can if they are willing to expend the costs in time and energy study a nonWestern culture in a serious way learning the language taking its account of the good as seriously as they I suspect it will be much easier in most cases to find the way to the samurai ideal from the Greek gentleman described by Aristotle than from the contemporary antibourgeois bourgeois prejudice which shudders at the very notion of rank or to find the way to Asian religion from a serious study of Augustine than from the contemporary dogmas of those who understand religion only as a manifestation of culture
""
On this basis too students can I think become better citizens of a liberal democracy
They learn how to escape from the plight of M Jourdan alternating helplessly between the attitudes of immense selfsatisfaction and total anxiety
It is not that they are freed from irony about themselves
On the contrary their irony will be far deeper because it will not have the phony salvation of progressive selfrighteousness to offer it temporary and inadequate relief
They know much better than before just how far they are from what is truly excellent
But this knowledge partly because it is knowledge their knowledge need one s own shortcomings is part of one s life one s possession and not a perpetual damnation by some unappeasable figure of authority
In those circumstances it makes sense to try to change oneself from inside to approximate standards that are not merely one s own but which one has made one s own without regard to the opinions of others
This is of course what those who sought to ennoble the bourgeoisie were after it is at the heart of the Kantian project that even now in scientific disguise as Kohlbergian psychology heavily influences the schools
But that end can not be held up as an ideal or hypostatized into a standard
If the end is already known if we communicate however subtly that becoming more sensitive or a more virtuous citizen or a despiser of bourgeois vulgarity or even an autonomous moral being is the goal of education then that education degenerates into edification
Only if all the cards are put on the table can students and hot gospeling are constitutive of their bourgeois lives emerge from the crippling irony and anxieties that are at root the same thing whether they express themselves as cynicism or dogmatism
Only then can students become what they are which is a necessary step to becoming something better than they are as citizens as human beings and yes as members of the bourgeoisie
By Fred Baumann
Fred Baumann is associate professor of political science at Kenyon College Gambier OH 
Just a few weeks ago at my own college at a meeting on the curriculum a colleague of mine in anthropology remarked that whatever else we may prescribe in a curriculum for the college he would argue for one requirement that our students come to understand a culture other than their own
This earnest man has been quite far from appreciating the irony of his proposal for these children the children of the American regime there is nothing so alien and unfamiliar as the doctrines of natural rights that shaped the understanding of the American Founders
Most of them have been raised in families that have identified themselves as Christian or Jewish and yet their convictions are quite at odds with the logic of that monotheism in which they have been raised
Not too long ago I saw a commentary on that story in the First Book of Kings when Elijah had lodged himself on Mount Horeb and he was instructed by God to journey to Damascus pointed out that this story had been thought to date from the first half of the ninth century BC and it showed just how early the Jews had absorbed the notion of monotheism
The God who could order a local prophet to cross the border install a new king or cashier an old one was not one of those local gods so familiar to antiquity
His authority was not confined to the land of Israel his authority was the same in all places his jurisdiction was understood to be universal
And of course the God who was the author of the universal laws of physics was also the author of moral laws that were not confined to Damascus or Jersey City
Most of our students at the most selective colleges and universities have been raised in churches and synagogues and yet they seem quite remote from this rudimentary point which is part of the logic of monotheism
Anyone who knows college students knows that they are gripped by the secular religion of cultural relativism absolute truth that there are no moral truths that preserve their truth in all places and times that notions of fight and wrong must always be relative to the country in which they are held
The students seem quite distant too from the understanding of the nineteenyearold Alexander Hamilton when he remarked on the root fallacy in Hobbes namely that Hobbes disbelieved in the existence of an intelligent superintending principle who is the governor and will be the final judge of the universe and that God has constituted an eternal and immutable law which is obligatory upon all mankind prior to any human institution whatever which is to say even before the advent of a government
That was not an idle observation it was bound up with the understanding of natural rights held by Hamilton and others among the Founders
And years later Hamilton would draw upon this same understanding as he pointed out the serious problems of coherence that afflicted the argument for engage in a serious study of the Bible or theology or the understanding of the American Founders would be for most of them an exercise in grasping an understanding quite at odds with what they are pleased to call at this moment their own culture
When we begin with these students at Amherst we have often begun in the study of politics by taking something near to them something familiarand then we try to show how strange it may be
At times we have started for example with Prof Robert Dahl and his account of politics in New Haven
Prof Dahl found a diffusion of power in the politics of his city with different sets of people being dominant in making policy say in the domain of education or real estate or public works
A certain political elite commanded a presence in all of these fields but the dominance of this elite was supposed to be offset by the fact that the leaders turned out to be the most committed to More than any other citizens the leaders were committed to the rules of the game and the conventions of democracy
But were those rules or norms like the rules of baseball or chess Were they like the rules that establish that we get a base on balls after four pitches wide of the strike zone The rule on balls and strikes or the number of men in the lineup are merely conventions we could readily change them without doing anything of moral significance and that may prompt us to ask just why political rules are good and just why the political elite respects them
After all the political elite may support these rules because they are the rules under which they have been successful
And they may continue to support them only as those rules continue to supply them with further successes
There is a notable difference between a willingness to uphold the socalled rules of the game for that reasonand a willingness to respect the principles both good and true that those rules describe a political regime that is morally superior to a despotism
And yet that was not the understanding of Prof Dahl
Dahl thought that the principles of democracy were in the end too nebulous to claim much meaning let alone truth
They were part rather of a creed or a belief
That the most educated people seemed to support a democratic regime more fully was explicable to him because education was the source of their indoctrination into these beliefs
At this point we are often moved to ask the students whether they learned in school the Pythagorean theorem ie the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of its two adjacent sides
And if they did would they be inclined later to say that they were indoctrinated in the Pythagorean theorem Students find that a curious expression
They are more disposed to say that they learned the Pythagorean theorem that when they came to understand the premises and the reasoning from which it had been drawn
Would it be possible then that the American Founders understood in the same way the moral truths expressed in the Declaration of Independence the truths on which the American republic was founded
But my colleagues at Amherst are quick to insist that no such analogy can be drawn that political and moral truths can not rest on the same kinds of axioms that underlay the truths of mathematics
In this respect of course they differ radically from Plato Locke and the American Founders they purport to explain
There can be no more dramatic example on this point than the passage Alexander Hamilton was content to strike off as the opening paragraph for Federalist 
The subject of that paper was taxation and in the course of that essay Hamilton would not say anything about taxation that could not be said today by Bob Dole
But any literate observer would be bound to notice something strikingly different in the furnishings of mind Hamilton chose to introduce his subject in this way
In disquisitions of every kind there are certain primary truths or first principles upon which all subsequent reasonings must depend
They contain an internal evidence which antecedent to all reflection or combination commands the assent of the mind
Where it produces not this effect it must proceed either from some disorder in the organs of perception or from the influence of some strong interest or passion or prejudice
Of this nature are the maxims in geometry that the whole is greater than its parts that things equal to the same are equal to one another that two straight lines can not enclose a space that all right angles are equal to each other
Of the same nature are these other maxims in ethics and politics that there can not be an effect without a cause that the means ought to be proportioned to the end that every power ought to be commensurate with its object that there ought to purpose which is itself incapable of limitation
People tutored in philosophy could see in this passage a mind attentive to the teachings of Thomas Reid and what has since been called the Scottish School
One of the finest characters among the Founders James Wilson was himself an immigrant from Scotland and when he took his place as part of the first Supreme Court he invoked the authority of Thomas Reid in the first case that actually elicited a set of opinions from the judges
That was Chisholm v Georgia decided in 
Wilson would explain in an elegant opinion that there were no cases built up as precedents under this new Constitution
It became ever more necessary then for the Court to speak about the principles of general jurisprudence before it would speak about the principles that marked the peculiar character of the American Constitution
Wilson took care to remind the audience of the Court that the principles of legal judgment were merely a part of the laws of reason and the authority of any case at law or any writer on matters legal he would invoke the authority of an original and profound writer in the philosophy of mind
He would appeal to Dr Reid in his excellent enquiry into the human mind on the principles of common sense speaking of the skeptical and illiberal philosophy which under bold but false pretensions to liberality prevailed in many parts of Europe before he wrote
""
In other words the Court would ascend to the task of judgment only after it insisted in the first instance that it was indeed possible to judge the Court would reject that skepticism in philosophy which denied the possibility of knowing moral truths just as it denied the possibility of knowing almost anything else
Wilson would move from the principles of general jurisprudence to the principles that defined the distinct character of the American Constitution
But the principles of lawfulness and the canons of reason did The American republic could claim to rest on truths that did not depend for their truth on the opinions dominant in America
As Wilson moved through this train of reasoning to produce his conclusions he advanced through the force of what he described as fair and conclusive deduction
 Seventeen years later Chief Justice John Marshall would offer a striking example of how a mind tutored in the same way could derive certain constitutional rights through deduction
The case was Fletcher v Peck and it was the occasion for striking down an act of the legislature in Georgia
The case involved a grant of public lands the buying of legislators and an attempt finally to strike at the corruption by rescinding the original grant of land to the speculators
Marshall and his colleagues saw in this act of rescinding the grant the subverting or undoing of the obligation of a contract
The impaired contract was the contract that conveyed the land to the current buyers who were the case in this way Marshall could have rested his judgment on a specific provision in the Constitution the Contract Clause the clause that forbade the states from impairing the obligation of contracts
But he chose to argue in a notably different way
He tried to show that the wrong engaged in this case could be deduced from the principle on ex post facto laws
Marshall explained that an ex post facto law is one which renders an act punishable in a manner in which it was not punishable when it was committed
But what was meant by punishment Many jurists had sought to solve a tricky problem by identifying ex post facto laws with those retrospective laws that imposed criminal penalties
But Marshall recognized that the problem could not be settled in such a facile way
I wo nt review here the subtle and searching challenge he raised on this point let us simply say that Marshall recognized that socalled civil penalties with large awards of damages the seizure of property as emphatic and astounding as penalties meted out through the criminal law
And so Marshall was moved to write
This rescinding act in Georgia would have the effect of an ex post facto law
It forfeits the estate of the buyer for a crime not committed by himself but by those from whom he purchased
This can not be effected in the form of an ex post facto law or bill of attainder why then is it allowable in the form of a law annulling the original grant 
Marshall evidently shared the assumption held by many of the Founders that the principle on expost facto laws was indeed a principle of law that was not only true but true of necessity
If Marshall could show then that the statute in Georgia was really a species of ex post facto laws he had every reason to be confident that the conclusion he drew about the wrongness of the statute was not merely defensible but compellingly true
His conclusion would flow with the logic of a syllogism
And in that event the wrongness of the statute would not hinge in any way on the question of whether contracts or grants or rescinding laws had been mentioned in the text of the Constitution
Marshall drew out the import of this point with a further and novel recognition
He remarked that Georgia was part of a large empire she is a member of the American Union and the Union had a Constitution that was supreme over its separate parts
But as a result of the argument that Marshall made in this case he could point out that the rescinding act passed by the legislature of Georgia might well be doubted were Georgia a single sovereign power
 That is even if Georgia had not come under the Constitution and the restrictions of the Contract Clause the action of the legislature would still have been wrong
For the legislature had violated a principle that did not depend for its validity on the explicit provisions of the Constitution Union
To put it another way Marshall did not rest his judgment on the authority of the Constitution
What he sought to show instead is that the Contract Clause in the Constitution derived its authority from a deeper principle of law that did not depend for its validity on the text of the Constitution
And in making that transition he apparently thought he was explaining far more decisively why the passage in the Constitution deserved to be treated with the solemn authority of a fundamental law
The section in the Constitution did not mark off merely a convention or understanding established in this country an understanding of what we in this particular tribe of Americans regarded as a wrong
But rather Marshall amplified the text and in his hand the provision on the Obligation of Contracts was made to alert us to the uses of law that were in principle wrong in all places
I had the occasion recently to recall a conversation with a friend who has military services
His students were all seasoned veterans in their forties they had all seen military action but they were still twenty years later the people who had been college students in the s and they had absorbed much of the secular religion that affected other young people at the time
They were on the whole skeptical of moral truths that held across cultures
They were willing to risk their lives for their country but they were notably uncertain about the grounds on which their country could claim to have the merit that justified such a risk
They would not claim that the political regime in America was morally superior to that of the Soviet Union say or Vietnam
They would settle for the far more modest claim that our political way of life was at least ours
""
Now I do nt deride this prejudice in favor of the things that are ours
But at a certain point the passion for what is ours can not provide a justification principles of a free regime were the equivalent merely of the conventions of baseball then it should be as plausible to change the principles of law as to change the rule on balls and strikes or the convention on designated hitters
And yet are we really free in the same way to alter these axioms of the law that people should not be held blameworthy or responsible for acts they were powerless to affect that like cases should be treated in like fashion according to the same rules that beings who are capable of understanding reasons deserve to be ruled through the rendering of reasons through a regime of consent Even the dimmest of us may suspect that these propositions are not merely conventional
They are not ours because we have chosen to adopt them rather we have adopted themwe have made them ours for the sovereign reason that they are compellingly true
Marshall shaped his argument in a rather elegant way but I would suggest that the man on the the kind of understanding that Marshall had touched
People continue to care about questions of equity and fairness about questions of reverse discrimination the burdens of taxation the tilt in the courts between criminals and victims
People persistently care about these questions which involve nothing less than the terms of principle on which we live together the terms on which we constitute ourselves as a political community
And when people do show their concern for these questions I would suggest that they show an awareness of that part of their lives that is not merely local a part that touches on something of a more enduring and universal significance
For something local we go to Zabar s for the cheesecake but for the conditions of justice we are all Athenians
Section POINT OF VIEW
Very often we hear protests against what is called the politicization of liberal education but before we can discuss that issue intelligently we must answer a more fundamental question whether or not all education is intrinsically political
To those myself included who object to using educational curricula to advance a certain political agenda or who object to indoctrination in the classroom whether it be indoctrination in feminism pacifism leftism conservatism or whatever the response is always the same all education is a type of indoctrination for all education is inherently political
The argument goes as follows education fills the student with some set of values either society s values or other values
What values get advanced is a function of what is taught of whether for example we read my Shakespeare or your Alice Walker
Educational choices are therefore political acts both in denying the promotion of one set of views and in substituting one person s agenda for another s by what we teach and what we do not teach but in any event we always indoctrinate
There are I think three different responses to this argument all of which have partisans if not reason on their side
The first accepts the political nature of education the second dogmatically denies it
Both fail to recognize the awkward consequences their arguments entail
The third involves a critical acceptance of the politics inherent in education but still insists on the possibility of an education that transcends its purely political roots
The first position tries mildly to ask what all the commotion is about
It rather plausibly argues as follows While there may be some knowledge and some principles that are properly transcultural and transhistorical most education grows out of a particular way of life out of a particular culture
How a democratic man raises his children is necessarily different from the way in which aristocratic or oligarchic men raise their children
The education of a person in child will learn by growing up in New Jersey
Not only is this the way education works we want it that way we want our future adult citizens to know something about and even to respect the principles of our democratic way of life
If we did nt transmit our principles through education we would be doing something stupid and suicidal
Such is the mild version of the first position which as far as it goes seems incontrovertible
The problem is that it is easily and often radicalized with indefensible results
The radical version runs as follows Yes education is the handmaiden of politics as we have just seen
So what in principle is the argument against education in support of the new politics of the advanced professoriate No doubt it is political to teach in class that for example the United States is committing genocide in Latin America or that property is theft but all teaching is political as you ve mind when schools teach the ideals of Jeffersonian democracy but object when I say that America is a corrupt society that should be overthrown It s not that I m more political than you it s just that you do nt share my politics
Once it is admitted that education is not value neutral but rather the supporter of particular beliefs or a particular way of life it is also admitted that all education is political and serves political ends
Now it s only a question of whose political ends
Consider for example the following All stances in scholarly research imply a prior commitment to some basic belief system
Furthermore At its best contemporary humanistic thinking does not peddle ideology but rather attempts to sensitize us to the presence of ideology in our work and to its capacity to delude us into promoting as universal values that in fact belong to one nation one social class one sect Thus spake scholarship implies a prior commitment to a basic belief system what exactly is the objection to teachers who peddle ideology Having radicalized the milder view that education is ultimately grounded in a given set of values the council easily slides into the view that all knowing is ideologized and finally has nothing to say against indoctrination except that rabid ideologues might not be to their taste
The second response to the claim that all education is political is the answer Do nt be silly
If you think that when I teach calculus or chemistry or which way the Mississippi River flows or when Eisenhower was elected president or who wrote Volpone I m being political then you re just wrong
Indeed common sense rebels at the broadness of the brush used by those who see education and indoctrination as necessarily intertwined
That a course in biology or mathematical logic could be political is implausible on its face and this despite or philosophy as if these disciplines had their ground in a particular set of political regimes
However this position though commonsensical has its limits mostly because it focuses entirely on content and not at all on selection
Why biology and not Eastern herbalism Why pick mathematical logic and not the study of the Vedas And of course the politics of selection becomes much clearer in the humanities and social sciences
What s so neutral about picking Shakespeare instead of native American oral literature Hardheadedness simply does nt respond to the argument at hand we make choices choices reflect values values stem from cultural social and political opinions
Ergo teaching the times table is a political act
Common sense may rebel but is has not yet provided a coherent response
The third and perhaps most satisfying position would respond along these lines Yes all education does involve a kind of acculturation and acculturation is a kind of politicization in the sense of being and foundations of a particular society
But to equate teaching logic or science or even political theory on the one hand and ideological indoctrination on the other is madness
Is there not a difference as even Marx observed between trying to understand the world and trying to change it Or to put it differently is there not a difference between a teacher trying to possess a student s mind and having a student possess his mind for himself
I think this is where we must begin and I do it with much trepidation
Yes education is political in the sense that it grows out of the culture of a people which culture is shaped in greatest measure by a nation s political principles
But there must be a way of distinguishing between the liberation of the mind through liberal education and the attempt to capture and coerce the mind through indoctrination
If we ca nt do that we should give up the defense of liberal education as impossible and try something more useful The proponents of oldfashioned liberal education have long argued that reading texts nonpolitically by that I mean looking for transtemporal and universal truths or principles is the one good road to wisdom
The argument rests on the fact that some questions and some answers transcend the particular political situation in which each person is placed
It rests on the view that universals are possible
What for example does Shakespeare teach about love or envy or loyalty or art Yet the radical politicization of liberal education perforce denies the existence of universal truths universal insights or transtemporal wisdom Once you have subtracted from the accidents of class race gender and political circumstance Mr Stanley Fish of Duke University writes what is it that you have left Well if you have nothing left if everything is culture race class and gender bound then there is no possibility of liberal education
You can not be liberated
At best even then you probably only made the switch because of the dictates of class race gender or politics
You ca nt have made the choice rationally since that s just a prejudice
Of course it s conceivable that people who say that all education is the propagandizing of mere values are trying to deceive us for why would they spend their lives pushing their values if they did not think them true But we should refuse to take the low road and accuse them of trying to deceive us
We should give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they are only deceiving themselves
But more
Sometimes the partisans of the politicization of the curriculum admit to the fact that not only is all education political but moreover that all politics is struggle
All politics is a matter of getting your way over others
Thus feminist readings of literary texts are sometimes portrayed as scholarly breakthroughs imaginative and inventive and sometimes candidly portrayed as vehicles for the elimination in the global fight
Or as Jonathan Culler of Cornell once put it we can not have a canon of literary texts since the concept supports the fundamental misogyny of the Reagan Administration and would eliminate courses in women s writing
 Hey Hey Ho Ho Western Culture s got to go is equally a curricular slogan and a slogan for struggle in the streets
Sometimes the arguments for curricular change in the direction of open proselytizing are so shabby as to merit giggles as well as tears
When Stanford for example said it would further liberate students minds by giving them books by contemporary ideologists women and people of color to cover contemporary issues they did virtually nothing to shake the prejudices of their students or especially their teachers
Rather they did everything to ratify opinions current in the winds
That this affirmative action program for already rife contemporary opinion could be described by columnist Ellen Goodman as Opening some people get fooled If they really wanted to transcend contemporary opinions and liberate the mind they would surely read Homer and Dante and Augustine rather than Frantz Fanon
But then again Homer and Dante and Augustine might not support the various orthodoxies many in the professoriate would like to see promoted
Or to put it differently truly to open up your mind you have to read books that disagree with today s unexamined prejudices in such areas as equality liberty democracy and rights
Such are the sins committed under the banner All Education is Political
Understood in those terms liberal education is impossible
Where however do we begin especially since we have partly admitted the truth that education and politics are not unconnected First I think we have to say that on one level acculturation is a necessary and legitimate part of education
Many I think would find it sad for indigenous cultures to reject their past and refuse to pass their skeptical of the worth of willful cultural suicide
In the same way we should be skeptical of the attempts made in our own midst to denigrate the study of this culture or of Western civilization
Know thyself to cite an impeccably Western authority applies universally to Japanese and Papuans and Nigerians as well as to Americans
If our students leave school with the most cutting of advanced opinions and do not know the foundations of this civilization and its work in its breadth and depth and detail they have been cheated
That said we must admit that mere acculturation or knowing our own proper as it is does not rise to the level of liberal education
It is however the firmest ground upon which liberal education can later start
What are we liberated from if not in part from the possibly wrong but formative opinions of our parents professors and priests
If students do nt know who Plato was or who wrote King Lear we will have no reason to respect their more progressive thoughts
The vaunted pluralism of American society changes this not one whit it seems clearly more necessary for recent Asian immigrants to know who Martin Luther King was than for American blacks to know the cultural contradictions of Cambodian society
Acculturation is the way in which we take marginal groups and strangers and make them fellow citizens and friends
Nonetheless on the highest level liberal education has to deny the argument that all education is political
It has to maintain the possibility of the liberation from the political opinions and prejudices of our friends and fellow citizens
Liberal education rises and falls on the possibility of transtemporal transhistorical transcultural truth
It lives on the prospect that there can be knowledge over opinion
Some of those who wish to indoctrinate rather than educate do recognize this
If American capitalism is true or if Marxism is true or if any other ism is true and it may be of course then liberal ideology
That would indeed be liberation of a sort
But liberal education has to be forgiven if it begins with skepticism of this matter if it says let us read as widely as possible among those who might be the best authors and most powerful minds let us learn something about the heavens and the rocks and the atoms and human nature and human conventions
Let us have the tools to judge for ourselves the truth of opinions others offer us
There are then two hallmarks of a truly liberal education first it concerns itself with the greatest of human issues issues such as the nature of love hate knowing truth loyalty justice God beauty number meaning and death
That is it concerns itself with objects of the mind and heart that can be transpolitical
And second it gives us a variety of the strongest best and most penetrating arguments and views of these topics
It has no hesitation even when they batter and shake our deepest sensibilities
To do anything less is to do the opposite of liberation it is to say we professors do not wish to liberate our students minds but only to possess them
Or worse that we are afraid to liberate our own minds from the numbing or giddy joys of ideology
Section REPORTS FROM THE ACADEMY
The SS Universe a floating campus sails around the world twice a year offering a Semester at Sea
The program is run by the University of Pittsburgh but the faculty staff and students are recruited from colleges and universities from all parts of the United States
I was invited to teach philosophy on the Spring voyage
We set sail from the Bahamas late in January with college students nonacademic staff members faculty members tourists and a Taiwanese crew of 
The students who came mostly from welltodo families were distinctly to the political right of the faculty the resident staff was New Age and apolitical the predominantly elderly tourists kept to themselves
In a situation of inescapable intimacy these ideological disparities proved to be a source of considerable tension
One course entitled Core was universally required and given every day at sea between and AM It itinerary but a few professors used it as a forum for consciousnessraising
Marxists and radical feminists are found on most campuses but I had never sat in on their lectures before
On one occasion a selfstyled Marxist economist patiently explained to the students the virtues of Marxism and praised the truly democratic workermanaged Yugoslav factories
He went on to say that the only problem with communist systems is that they do not always produce enough incentive
I pointed out other problems such as the suppression of human rights
We bickered heatedly and at length in front of everyone and as a result I became a favorite with many of the students and tourists at the price of alienating quite a few of my colleagues
While at sea classes met every other day in makeshift but pleasant classrooms throughout the ship
Course offerings were diverse covering topics such as the art of India the history of modem Russia United States foreign policy from to the present poetry and revolution
I taught the philosophy of religion theories of ethics and social philosophy
Students spent most of their port time usually four to five days on activities complementing their class work
Many took organized tours to celebrated sites the Alhambra the Pyramids Red Square the Taj Mahal some went on educational field trips arranged by their professors eg a ballet performance in Odessa Mother Teresa s center in Bombay a factory in Yugoslavia or Hiroshima and a wellheeled few would check into the nearest Sheraton and order drinks from room service
Most of our evenings at sea were filled with films panel discussions and musical performances as well as facultysponsored gender awareness seminars and teachins
We had visiting interport lecturers experts on specific parts of the world would join the cruise for a few weeks to give detailed background lectures
Sometimes I felt trapped in an endless public television documentary but most of the talks were well unforgettable
While we were docked in Manila Harbor Mrs Aquino came aboard and told us how she acceded to power and was holding on despite several assassination attempts
The very day she visited our ship the young Communist leader Ramon who had staged an unsuccessful coup escaped from prison and was rumored to be hiding out in the harbor where we were docked
I believe the students got a sense of how fragile democracies can be in that part of the world
Odessa was our Soviet port
The students had been warned in the strongest terms never to trade on the black market they took this as a challenge and traded wildly exchanging Ray Bans Nikes Walkmans and Ivy League sweatshirts for Russian military paraphernalia prized booty from the Evil Empire
Nearly everyone staying in Odessa for those four days was invited into private homes by friendly people in the street and many have stayed in touch
Yet on the whole the students were put off by the police drag a black marketeer behind a building and beat him up
One paid a visit to a local writer a relative of a friend back home the next day the writer was arrested
I felt especially sorry for a group of lonely Algerian engineering students who told me they were forbidden by Soviet authorities to date Russian girls
How did you like the Soviet Union I asked one of my favorite colleagues a professor of sociology but not one to resort to academic jargon
It s a loony bin he replied
But quite a few of my other associates had a very different reaction
Some had energetically visited day care centers workers communes and cultural exchange programs and were full of praise for what they saw
Had we been in the same country A few became increasingly irritated with the students for concentrating so much on human rights violations
Indeed several of the faculty were convinced that most of us in need of a new perspective which they would be happy to supply
Several students told me they could improve their grades in certain classes by taking a proSoviet attitude
One student wrote an excellent but critical paper on Russia and got a C In a subsequent version she replaced her criticisms with praise for the deeper Russia upping her grade to an A
By now I realized how my doctrinaire colleagues on the SS Universe solved the pedagogical problem posed to us by the requirement that all our courses should make thematic use of the countries we were to visit
The leftists had a readymade solution treat the voyage as a fieldtrip whose object lesson was to cast the United States in an unfavorable light
Reality however frequently proved unaccommodating
In nearly every port of call students met local students taxi drivers tour guides and storekeepers who told them America is my dream
The feminists on board repeatedly felt it necessary to dismiss the opinions and actual preferences of a duped constituency raised from birth to become the unwitting handmaidens of the sexgender system which is a system of male dominance organizing social life throughout most of recorded history and in every culture today
 Small wonder then that so many women will tell you they want romance weddings sexy clothes and marital domesticity the very things that hold them in thrall to the patriarchy
By the time we reached the Arabian Sea those on board the SS Universe had fallen into a welldefined set of cliques
For example the nonacademic personnel or Resident Directors RDs for short were in charge of student problems and morale
A few were popular but most were not which was natural since they were inordinately proud of their status and punitive authority
One student asked a RD how she might apply for the job after graduating
The RD replied in horror You do nt just become a RD
It s an honor which all students were urged to attend
On one occasion an exhippie on the security staff stood up faced the group and admitted or boasted that he had taken LSD hundreds of times
He told us he used to work in a weapons factory where for fun he would take LSD and handle nuclear weapons
It was really scary he said
So are you we thought
""
Some RDs spoke a language all their own
Two weeks into the voyage they informed the faculty that the students were norming translation developing rules
As the ship approached Seattle upon our return they informed us that the process of renorming had begun
Many of the RDs were very leery of the students and spoke as if we could be facing a Lord of the Flies situation at any moment
They tried to diffuse the explosive situation by sponsoring frequent theme parties and rap sessions
The RDs of the ship
Among the students there were the defiantly frivolous
One fraternity boy from Southern Methodist University said to me in earnest I do nt want to look back on this trip when I am an old man and regret having spent it studying
I want to be able to tell my grandchildren that I partied my way around the world
This was hardly the attitude we were trying to cultivate in our students but even the academic dean found this insouciant fellow amusing
Then there were the officially contentious whose chief a University of Colorado prelaw major had several tshirts bearing the legend Nixon Rested and Ready for 
He liked to pick fights with the radical feminists
The RDs made no impression on him they sent several letters to his professors asking whether he was academically derelict
To their chagrin he turned out to be a straight A student who was honored at graduation
The ship also had its antihero for smoking pot
He became a legend when he proceeded on his own to meet the ship at every port from Malaysia to Seattle
Banners appeared Hans lives My son s babysitters taught him to say Long live Hans The RDs were frantic and held emergency meetings on How to demystify Hans Most of the students acknowledged that if guilty Hans deserved expulsion all the same they were happy to confer hero status on one of their own
The academic feminists found grist for their mill in every port of call
One might think they would be concerned primarily with the basic inequities women suffer in some of the countries we visited but it was gender roles in general that aroused their indignation
In Spain they were upset by the large number of bridal shops and all that they implied
They inveighed against the acrobatic shows in Chinadid we notice that the women s costumes were tighter than the men s In invited to play local teams one young woman embarrassed our hosts by calling them sexist for having male and female teams
Either men and women play together or we do not play at all In what was called a cultural performance a group of students and teachers were treated to a Soviet cabaret show
The radical feminists were outraged when some scantily clad Odessa curies did their version of a Las Vegas show number
And the academic feminists were especially disturbed by the reaction of Third World men to our attractive women students who created the usual havoc wherever they went
In Bombay I accompanied a group of students to an Oxfam Development project
The project called Anna Puma provides lowinterest loans to poor women so they can run small catering services from their homes
These provide the homeless with inexpensive meals and give the women and their families badly needed income
In the center where the women pick up supplies they also learn about birth control nutrition hygiene inlaws
My students and I saw clearly how these women s lives had been changed very much for the better both by the center and the lowinterest loans
I gave a Core lecture about Oxfam and the excellent work it was doing in Bombay and urged the students to consider spending some time working for a relief organization such as the Peace Corps or Oxfam or Care
I also outlined a famous essay by Australian philosopher Peter Singer who argues that members of the affluent West have a moral obligation to work actively to mitigate poverty in the Third World
My doctrinaire colleagues were incensed
For several weeks afterwards I heard about how they used class rime to denounce Oxfam and other field organizations for diverting attention from the real solution
I countered by telling my students to be leery of people who find no joy in the direct improvement of others lives
I pointed out that ideological indifference to individual wellbeing is the sort of thing that carries over after the revolution
""
Would Egypt or India the radical professors kept asking the students at Core in an attempt to impart the lesson that if poor it is better to be born in a communist country than a capitalist one
Some of the faculty fondly believed that given the choice a poor Indian or Egyptian would prefer living in the Soviet Union
I almost envied their ability to dismiss all counterevidence
I told my students to ask themselves why so many of the world s poor seek entry into the United States and then to find out how many were seeking entry into the Soviet Union
Later I pointed out that there was little indication that the professors themselves would prefer life in the Soviet Union to that in the arch capitalist country that gives them full license to teach what they please as they please
On Easter Sunday I went with a group of students to the outskirts of Manila to see what we thought would be a symbolic reenactment of the crucifixion
When we got off the us bare backed and beating themselves with whips
Blood spouted everywhere including all over my dress
At the end of the procession three people a young woman and two young men were voluntarily crucified
Nails were hammered into their wrists and ankles and they hung on crosses from noon until three
It is popularly believed that these wounds immediately heal
In fact the woman died the next day
The church does not like this practice the Peace Corps has tried to stop it but the locals seem to love it
Grandparents kids everyone was there in trucks and vans with coolers and hibachis as if for a Sunday afternoon tailgate party
My students and I were quite shaken by the spectacle and distressed by the crowd s attitude
A Peace Corps worker I met said that by attending we were helping to perpetuate this ritual
She may have been right though I suspect that she is underestimating its intrinsic appeal to the local participants
A large contingent docked in Hong Kong
It is difficult to go from Hong Kong to Beijing without having the sense of traveling back in time to a grimmer past
The Chinese intellectuals I met did not share this perspective
In conversation with some Beijing University professors I gently broached the subject of China s harsh treatment of Tibet
But they are backward and feudal they exclaimed
So why not just let them be backward and feudal I countered
My remark caused amazement was it not evident that a developed country is responsible for fostering progress It was clear to me that the socalled white man s burden has shifted elsewhere
Our students were taken aback by the mean lives of their counterparts at Beijing University
The poverty and the overcrowded conditions were to be expected but they were incensed by the rules forbidding dating intimacy was punishable by expulsion
Those staying at the university were critical of the conditions that the Chinese students themselves would protest one year later
plane trip back to Hong Kong
But some of our faculty were by now completely fed up with the students inability and unwillingness to appreciate the spiritual and moral qualifies of the socialist way of life
Several blew their tops and later spent entire lecture hours denouncing the students
On April we set sail from Kobe Japan for Seattle
Though the final leg of our trip would take almost two weeks we had little time at first to dwell on our impending homecoming
The students were nervous about their finals the faculty did not much care for the job of grading them
After these chores were behind us we did react
In the middle of the Pacific a plague of insomnia struck like something out of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel
To make matters worse various groups were in full cry
The RD crowd scheduled marathon therapy sessions on reentry and renorming to help us get in touch with our feelings about going home
The Women Do nt Need Men The Myth of Femininity Date Rape
The human sexuality class circulated a survey querying students about their sexual behavior on the voyage
They were asked if when where and how often they engaged in masturbation intercourse sodomy homosexuality group sex and bestiality for several days I saw groups of laughing students filling out the surveys
The results were reported in a Phil Donohuestyle group discussion led by the radical feminist professor who gave the course
The rest of the faculty kept a dignified distance from this event
In this last week of my semester at sea I found more of my colleagues telling me how strongly they disagreed with the faculty ideologues
One said however that he would never openly challenge them on his own campus since he would be immediately branded as an illiberal crank or worse
It is partly this attitude of caution and timidity that allows a small minority inordinate power to affect the university in microcosm of a university was altogether characteristic
Indeed the SS Universe is a model of moderation compared to many a campus on dry land
Under the circumstances I was very grateful to the academic dean a sensible and honorable man and a devout Red Sox fan under whose stewardship we managed to have a seemly and ideologically neutral graduation ceremony
The students with whom I have remained in contact tell me that their itinerant semester was the best experience they have ever had
I must say that living with them at dose quarters has given me a new respect for American students
I found them innately decent and sensible enterprising and fun they studied hard and learned much
The program of studies was on the whole sound and the proportion of ideologues on the faculty was low compared with the percentage inhabiting most landlocked campuses
One might have expected however that dose contact with their constant blandishments and doctrinaire harangues would have a profound effect on impressionable undergraduates
But rendered them impervious or perhaps it was just the tight schedule of studies and their determination to enjoy themselves
In any case the students were on the whole no more than politely patient with the wouldbe mentors who never stopped disparaging the system that had afforded them this voyage

Section FOR THE RECORD
Editor s Note In the regents of the University of Wisconsin issued a document entitled Mandate for Cultural Diversity which called upon each campus in the system to devise required programs in cultural diversity education for their students
At the University of WisconsinMilwaukee campus a resolution requiring that all students receive education in the life experiences of minority groups was hastily pushed through the faculty senate before the faculty as a whole had a chance to review the proposal
One hundred and fifteen professors signed a petition demanding a special faculty meeting but the administration managed to avoid it through parliamentary legerdemain and a compliant university committee acquiesced
Reprinted below are excerpts from a series of letters and addresses written by one of the leading faculty opponents of these proposals
They comprise an eloquent defense of the intellectual principles on which higher education should stand and reveal the degraded nature of the process through which academic policy is all too often implemented
September PREFORMATTED your letter of May and for Prof William Damon s article on racial disturbance in the universities
It was kind of you to take a particular interest in our campus
If I may I should like to explain my opposition to the Faculty Senate s GER resolution requiring the teaching of minority life experiences to all students
My objection is twofold
The first objection is parliamentary
In April of the faculty was unaware that the GER resolution was being entertained
This legislation was brought up suddenly at the very end of the spring term passed quickly in one afternoon and kept far removed from faculty participation even though two senators requested a plenary ballot in the mails
Why the haste Why the secretiveness Why the subsequent rhetoric of assertion Why were the administration and senate reluctant to have the faculty examine such a profound and revolutionary general education requirement And why was the senatorial vote against faculty participation against the plenary ballot so onesided the senate intimidated Were the senators voting under duress Was their vote animated by political or extramural considerations rather than the good of the students These questions remain to be answered
I have recently heard it argued that some of the faculty were indeed informed or that the faculty were informed but not adequately
What sort of argument is this Can you imagine a Wisconsin referendum in which Vilas County is alerted but not Brown County Kenosha but not Racine intimates of both political parties but not farmers and factory workers Surely such a state of affairs would mean that the electorate was not informed
The same argument holds for the University of WisconsinMilwaukee
The administration should have used its colorcoded stationery pink with orange stripe to indicate that a decision of exceptional importance was at hand and it should have done so in the fall of so that faculty executive committees and course and curriculum committees could have examined and discussed the new proposal long before the April vote
Academic decorum and the new GER resolution ought to be returned to the faculty for a semester s consideration and debate and then in the absence of a responsible senate decided on by a plenary ballot in the spring of 
Unless this is done the University of WisconsinMilwaukee will have lost its sense of academic shame
My second objection is far more serious
Permit me to quote here the Senate s GER resolution of April 
Beginning in Semester I the University of WisconsinMilwaukee requires every undergraduate to complete three credits pertaining to the study of the life experiences of African Americans Hispanic Americans American indians andor Asian Americans as a condition of graduation
Courses satisfying this requirement will be so designated on the divisions list of the General Education Requirement courses
The key phrase here is life experiences
The paragraph does not say the history of the minorities sociology of the minorities anthropology of the minorities their political philosophy or art history but their life so profound in higher education as to exceed all other revolutions
For what does life experiences mean
the central subject as it so often is is history and historiography
Had the resolution read the history of the minorities it would mean that the University of WisconsinMilwaukee would have to employ a team of PhD
s in history professionals who would study the documents and other records and teach the students from them explaining the economic social political and cultural history of the minorities
In this way the history taught under the new resolution would differ from the history of France England Germany and other nations in content but not in methodology
The same historical principles would obtain and the courses on the minorities would indeed be interesting and contributory to the students higher education
One might still argue against such courses as a general education requirement I myself would so argue but one could not question their professional character
The GER resolution but their life experiences
The disciplines are omitted from the statement and with them all thought of a university education goes out the window one might call this phenomenon The Defenestration of Milwaukee
One does not need a PhD
to teach life experiences indeed a PhD
would probably stand in the way since doctoral degrees are not typical of the experience of any nation nor does one need a master s degree or even a bachelor s degree
The teacher could be a factory worker farmer salesman fruit vendor truck driver or on the negative side a miscreant or neerdowell and qualify for life experiences
In economics it would be better to hire a store clerk than a professor since stores and shopping are the stuff of experience and in courses on urban costumbrismo a peddler or picaroon is preferable to a sociologist or literary scholar because he has the requisite experience
I am not suggesting that factory workers farmers salesmen and others are intrinsically inferior to but only that they can not provide the students with higher learning
The students have made a contract with the university and sealed it with their tuition and the university must give them the promised education or be culpable of malfeasance
I gather from Prof Damon s article and from your first letter of last spring that you are anxious to improve racial relations on this campus
Several professors have told me that the new general education requirement may have a different effect from the one intended that it may do more harm than good
Picture a high school student arriving here his soul a tabula rasa
He may take a French or Spanish or American history course taught by a qualified professor
He will perhaps enjoy a profound educational experience based on the accumulated wisdom of a discipline and of a scholar who has devoted his life to mastering that discipline
He will be satisfied
Then he walks into a life experiences class the next semester where the teacher is an amateur who has to his anecdotes will be interesting for a couple of weeks but unless he be a latterday Scheherazade what will follow Will he repeat himself over and over or romanticize the past falsifying it or emote or complain about injustice or enter the future with prophecy Without a discipline behind him what is he going to do for fifteen weeks three hours a week When I ask these questions I am speaking introspectively since I know that without a degree in history philosophy or literature my friends and I might entertain a class for a week or so but not much longer
The students will quickly perceive the difference between History and Life Experiences and the cause of the minorities will suffer not because of their inferiority but owing to the simple truth that in a university anybody s life experiences will suffer when unaccompanied by a discipline
If the University of WisconsinMilwaukee does not require the same standards of the minorities as it does of everyone else then it kindly nor will the students

Once again Mr Weinstein many thanks for your letter and article
It is always good to learn of your interest in our welfare
PREFORMATTED TABLE
Every worthy directorate will want to make informed decisions and so I am writing you concerning the special faculty meeting of December 
It was an uncanny meeting with an elusive air and general want of academic dignity
There was a crowd in the vestibule gawking and gaping into the auditorium there were pickets moving about there were separate sections for pro s and con s and most noticeably there was no debate
There was no intellectual discussion at all an attitude patently approved by the senate university committee and administration
I remember saying to myself Can this be so In a university Is nt this denial of the intellect equivalent to burning the books
I shall not try your patience with all the details which run to seven pages I shall limit my letter to two episodes both contradicting this university s tradition
The gallinaceous crowd forming in the vestibule was as large as the audience inside and every two minutes I heard a strident voice cry out Do nt go in Do nt go in You ll give them a quorum A quorum would mean intellectual discussion an appeal to reason
Do nt go in You might have to use your intellect if you do
And so the Galliformes bobbing about in the rear did nt come down the aisles to share their thoughts with the rest of us and their refusal came in the name of cultural diversity
The most lamentable piece was to come
I looked about me and saw that Prof A was nt there he who had taken so much interest in the new resolution
I asked a friend where he was and was told that he had nt come because he felt menaced
Someone on learning to him at lunch that day I did nt know you were a racist
I also noticed that B was nt there and C and D and S and T as well none of those faces I knew and admired thirty or more of them
And I said to myself Were they menaced too Were they called racists even though they were no such thing What a loss What an easy way to deny a faculty a quorum Hold the meeting on a Friday afternoon so that many professors ca nt attend give insufficient notice of the meeting do nt permit proxy voting and then intimidate the professors with pickets and the threat of being called a racist
I have searched for a word to sum up these events for you and believe I have found it in the rough and tumble arena of modem politics
All these events are the product of Muscular Liberalism ML the devious rogue bean of the great State University of Wisconsin
in the name of Equality
And be sure to bring your pickets and verbal brickbats when you do Give it to em good lads In other words Los liberales no lo son
What has become of the University of Wisconsin
Ladies and Gentlemen does the new GER resolution meet your expectations I believe it does not but the damage is done and one can hardly turn back the clock
May I suggest however that you do the following and so bring your mandate to an honest conclusion
Please send all the professors at the University of WisconsinMilwaukee a private ballot simply worded asking them whether they favor the new cultural diversity requirement Document and ask them to return the ballots to you privately so that you can keep them in petto
This privacy will avoid public embarrassment because the ballots are going to run at least four to one against the requirement
The ballots will also enable you to make informed decisions in more mandates
As I write this paper about that phantasmagoric afternoon I think above all of my menaced colleagues and the general air of unreason
I remember the crowd I saw on December and the disrespect shown the faculty more than a hundred of whom had requested an intellectual discussion
Let us hope this disrespect does not reappear in diversity classrooms as it has on other campuses
PREFORMATTED TABLE
PS Where is the sifting and winnowinga by which alone the truth can be found There does nt seem to be any only political coercion and a parliamentary coup denying faculty participation
PREFORMATTED TABLE
The following address was presented on February at a Popcorn Forum
It would seem that in today s world there are two basic ways of looking at the university
The first considers the university to be a problemsolving institution
The university will clean up Lake Michigan provide social justice discover the causes of crime provide remedies and take care of many inequities in the university is akin to the Departments of Health Agriculture Welfare and also the police department
The education of the students is secondary in such a picture whereas the needs of the community come first
Under this view of the university the regents can issue the professors a mandate telling them what their philosophy of education is to be and the administration following the regents lead can resort to parliamentary legerdemain to make sure the mandate is obeyed
This is what we have experienced at the University of WisconsinMilwaukee a mandate followed by parliamentary evasion
The second basic way of looking at a university is quite distinct from the first
It considers the university to be an academy a house of reason that has been set aside from the political and commercial worlds so that professors and their students can study dispassionately without the fetters of predetermined mandates and missions
There will be some passion of course like that of the poet who has intuitively lighted on a new metaphor rewarded with another Dead Sea Scroll but there will not be the willful ruthless passion of quotidian politics
According to this view the education of the students is primary not secondary
All the students are endowed with human dignity which means they can not be used as means to an end
The university exists for the students they do not exist for the university nor do they exist for the state
In the light of what I have just said let us consider the mandate for socalled cultural diversity
A university has unique traditions just as a hospital does or a court of law or an athletic team
In a hospital for example a certain room is set aside for specific purposes
We call this an operating room
Only a few people are allowed to enter here a couple of doctors several nurses and perhaps an orderly all of whom must perform prescribed rituals before entering they must scrub themselves with soap cover rules apply only in a hospital
They could not be exercised elsewhere for example as in a court of justice where many people must be allowed to enter
On the other hand the law court has a judge who is really a monarch a person of tremendous authority who could not be tolerated elsewhere in a democratic society and certainly not in a classroom
Finally a good example of what I say about special rules comes from the sport of football where lines of demarcation are drawn around the field
Within those lines one can run into a man and hammer him into the ground possibly dislocating his shoulder
And the audience will applaud If you do the same thing one yard outside the lines you will be given a fifteenyard penalty and if you do it just a mile away on Wisconsin Avenue a policeman will come to arrest you
The same rules do not obtain everywhere
And so it is within a university
A father and mother a free university where professors have to ascertain the truth and educate their students you simply do not issue mandates
It s not allowed
In a company of infantry the captain will issue a mandate ordering his troops to seize the high ground because there is no time for committee meetings and democratic decisionmaking in the heat of battle someone has to give an immediate order
But a university is not like that for authority here is the weakest of all arguments
A proposition is not true because Plato or Aristotle said it rather they said it because they had an insight into the truth
And geometry is not true because Euclid said it rather he was an exceptionally talented man who discovered many truths about measurement
The point is that mandates are out of place and destructive in a university
The argument has been made to favor the socalled cultural diversity requirement that universities are biased even prejudiced because the curriculum insists on European authors and institutions predominantly caucasian
Let us examine this accusation in the light of traditional studies
In ancient times there were many great nations the Egyptians Persians Phoenicians Medes Hittites Etruscans Carthaginians and others and then there were the Greeks a small nation consisting perhaps of a million people or even less
Nevertheless in the university today one could base onethird or half of the curriculum on the Greeks alone or even more not because they were caucasian or our ancestors or our favorites or our crowd as they say in politics but simply because their creations surpassed those of other nations
The philosophical debate we are conducting in this room today would be impossible without the Greeks who founded the science of epistemology and the art of rhetoric
Our very citizenship for example when we say I am an American citizen would not exist were it not for the Greek polis which the Romans subsequently adopted as the civitas or citystate
Greek invention and the same statement will hold for narrative and lyrical poetry the Homeric epopee and Pindaric ode
And just take a look at our sciences philosophy psychology history mathematics zoology biology they are all Greek discoveries
Why their very names are Greek
There is no feeling here of an antiHittite prejudice
And nobody is about to call the ancient Etruscans and Medes disparaging racial names or to create for the Phoenicians a humiliating Pale of Settlement
All these nations are equally welcome to the academic community and indeed a few professors will devote their entire lives to studying the language archaeology and history of their people
But in assigning broad general education requirements one must throw one s support to the Greeks
It is a question of professional choice not caprice or political preferment
Nor in this choice is there any trace of racism
We come now to the heart of the matter the students and their general education requirements that take regardless of their major field of study
Traditionally students have had to take courses in a few disciplines for example in the College of Letters and Science they have been obliged to enroll in two disciplines in the natural sciences social sciences and humanities which would mean history philosophy economics anthropology physics and so forth
But Senate Document which is under question here today specifies a requirement in the life experiences of four races Hispanic AfroAmerican American Indian and Asian
What does lift experiences mean Does it mean a series of anecdotes an advertisement of the self a rhetoric of assertion indoctrination a reduction of subjects like philosophy and history to popular culture with a popular methodology or what The document does not say and the faculty has not been given the opportunity to discuss the question
One hundred and fifteen professors signed a petition requesting a meeting for such a discussion but the supporters of the meeting hall carried pickets saying Socrates Is Dead gaped and gawked into the meeting hall and refused to come in
Consequently there was no discussion no explanation of any kind
And the administration faculty senate and university committee wholeheartedly approved this nonfeasance
I ask myself this question and I ask you also Why this refusal to discuss such a revolutionary requirement in education a requirement based on race rather than on the disciplines And if one is concerned about transmitting the culture of the minorities to college students why use a vague term like lift experiences why not say the history of Hispanic immigrants the sociology of AfroAmericans the anthropology of the other minorities to be taught by the faculty in the departments alluded to Would nt this be the professional way of approaching the question
Let us turn now from the requirement to the students
The students coming to the University of WisconsinMilwaukee may be adults socially but academically they do not display a familiar with Louis XIV Napoleon Bismarck or Cavour
In many cases they have nt even heard these names nor can they place the Thirty Years War the French Revolution and nineteenthcentury nationalism
In American history they do nt know the figures of our great Civil War nor can they distinguish between our presidents for example between Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Most of our students simply do nt know history
In literature they do not perceive the difference between a novel and a play between narrative poetry and lyrical poetry between an essay and a treatise
Nor have they heard of the oral tradition the epic poems and ballads
The work of scholars like Albert Lord and Milman Parry lies completely outside their experience
The subject they are least familiar with is philosophy where pantheism the allegory of Plato s cave noumena and schools like Cartesianism are words and thoughts they have never heard before
Suffice it to say that the incoming students at that is they do nt know themselves
The general education requirements should be used to fill this void
Please understand that I do nt object to the creation of courses concerning minorities
I am merely arguing that they should not be general requirements mandated of everyone and I argue that they should be made professional by substituting history philosophy anthropology and the other disciplines for the vague notion of life experiences
We are here to educate our students not to transmit ideologies
We are here to open a window on their souls not to indoctrinate them
The coercive mandatory nature of Senate Document which was pushed through the senate without the faculty s knowledge has created unnecessary grief here
The campus has been polarized over this superficial life experiences document whereas a truly professional approach might have been widely accepted
Why did nt the regents and administration approach the executive committees of three or four departments for example history anthropology political science and Gentlemen would you be willing to create a professorship in your discipline in the study of AfroAmericans the American Indian and other minorities We have set aside an ample sum of money to attract a good scholar and there will be some perquisites summer salary support a library budget some travel allowance and stipends for a couple of teaching assistants
We want your new professor to create a few good courses that will add to the education of our students and gain the respect of the academic community
You will have two years to complete your recruitment
""
I ca nt imagine one of the departments just named turning down such an offer although under faculty governance it is dearly their right to do so
But if they refused then the authorities without recrimination could approach the executive committees of other departments such as cultural geography economics sociology and the foreign languages
Three or four such professorships with their excellent courses would do far more for the coercion and our campus would not be polarized
These courses would stand side by side qualitatively with other courses in the social sciences and humanities and they would not require the crutch of mandates for acceptance
I should like now to close my presentation with a reflection on two thoughts that bode ill for our university
Indeed they are grounds for deep concern
Lately I have been reading Prof Robert O Paxton s books on Vichy France that is France from to during the Second World War
The government there was beset with many problems arising from the tide of refugees who fled to France from all over Europe and so it established a numerus clausus a quota system for coping with these problems
It was not a pleasant picture
I believe that the new GER resolution Senate Document is really a numerus clausus a quota not only guaranteeing preference for some citizens but ultimately exclusion for others
And who knows regents may mandate six credits in such a program instead of three or nine or twelve or more
Why not The precedent has been set and the administration has shown its disposition to engage in parliamentary legerdemain
My second thought is ground for even greater concern
I would liken the mandate and coercion at the University of WisconsinMilwaukee to the Lysenko Affair in Soviet Russia
In this affair a scientist Trofim Lysenko was director of the Institute of Genetics in the Soviet Academy of Sciences
Unlike his colleagues in other countries he rejected Mendelian genetics in favor of the doctrine of acquired characteristics and owing to his connection with Joseph Stalin he forced his views on Soviet agriculture
The effects as you might imagine were disastrous
Lysenkoism took the pose of a new freedom in science a blow for progress in the face of outdated traditionalism but the historical reality was different indeed
Although the basic question was alleged to be a new science it was really a problem it in The Lysenko Affair Not only genetics but all the sciences impinging on agriculture were tyrannically abused by quacks and timeservers for thirtyfive years
The Lysenko Affair in short was thirtyfive years of brutal irrationality in the campaign for improved farming
I suggest to you here assembled this afternoon that something similar to the Lysenko Affair has happened at the University of WisconsinMilwaukee with the irrationality of socalled cultural diversity
Cultural diversity is nothing of the sort it is not a generous intellectual effort but a dogma imposed on us by the regents and enforced by the administration which clearly does nt want the faculty to debate it or vote on it
In the circumstances it seems a cruel joke to make students enroll in politically motivated racial courses when their knowledge of their own culture is wanting and also their knowledge of themselves

Section ISSUES
During my years in Washington and Boston my duties have included giving a substantial number of newspaper radio and television interviews as well as writing columns articles and books
I often receive advance telephone calls from the media that go something like this
CALLER Hello Dr Delattre You re an ethicist right
EJD No I m a philosopher
CALLER Pause Well whatever
Or more often But that has something to do with ethics right
EJD Yes
CALLER Good
We re doing a onehour spot next week on the Barney Frank affair or academic pricefixing or antiracist regulations in colleges or ethics in government or corruption in business or the drug control strategy or ethical dilemmas in foreign policy and so on
We have someone to say that Barney Frank should be thrown out of Congress
We need someone to take the other side
We that we have to grow up and stop being critical of public officials
Where do you come down Or more frequently How do you feel and are you our man
Now to anyone who cares about ethics or even about intellectual honesty this is pretty grim and frightening stuff
Logicians will recognize the fallacy of insufficient options the supposition that every real or fabricated issue has exactly two sides both extreme
Among the media few seem to recognize that some issues have many sides while others may have only one that a responsible person can reasonably take
Furthermore there is scarcely any sense among producerslet alone the putative ethicists of Socrates ideal of dialogue as a shared and cooperative pursuit of the truth or the closest approximation of it by knowledgeable candid people of good will
Instead there is a manipulative limitation of ethical discourse to passionate disagreement much of it incivil that is thought to be entertaining and therefore marketable the presumption that each side will be resolutely impenetrable to any reasoning that may be offered by the other
Thus is reason portrayed as a mere servant of the passions and seldom if ever as a way of thinking and behaving that is grounded in the Socratic ideal of dialogue
Often those who proclaim themselves fit to make ethical pronouncements for the media do not know the facts of a case do not know how to reason conscientiously and do not even have good manners
But they are entirely willing to be impervious to reason
I suppose it is not surprising under such circumstances that I receive inquiries from college students and job applicants I hesitate to say aspirants who say I want to be an ethicist for newspapers and television
Where do I go for that kind of job I infer that they want to be celebrities not philosophers and ultimately will measure the success of their careers by how often their names appear in columns and how frequently other on television
These are the ambulance chasers of ethics
All of this tends to leave the impression that ethics is really indistinguishable from borderline moral fanaticism ordinarily laced with an unhealthy dose of political partisanship or at least the bias of special interest and motives having nothing to do with virtue principle or conscience
It leaves the sense that all disputes must be settled by litigation confrontation or raw power and never by reasoned understanding that may lead to honorable compromise or even enlightenment
A central obligation of higher education is to stand on higher moral ground than this not only for the sake of students but also for the sake of instructing the general public
But all too frequently its spokesmen lack the vision decency knowledge competence and ability to reason necessary to do so
Not long ago for example the Justice Department began an investigation of alleged tuition and financial aid pricefixing by a large group of prestigious colleges and universities sides on this issue
While there was relatively little dispute about whether prices and financial aid packages were actually being fixed a surprising number of college spokesmen were willing remorselessly to defend the practice
This defense of academic pricefixing is deeply disappointing but it is so typical of the shallowness offered up by such advocates that it can scarcely surprise us
The position runs along these lines Certainly we decide together on tuition and financial aid policies amounts and packages
That s a lot better than having bidding wars for students
And besides the cost of education should not be a factor in a student s decision about where to go to school
""
Now if ever there was a selfindulgent instance of the fallacy of insufficient options this is it
Such spokesmen arrogantly tell the public that we have no choice but to suffer either pricefixing or bidding wars
They offer not the slightest suggestion that another option is for each institution in light of its mission and staff compensation its degree of commitment to an economically diverse student body and its financial liabilities to set annually a responsible price in relation to actual cost per student to determine the portion of financial need it is in a position to meet and to decide the extent to which its mission requires scholarships as well as needbased financial aid
Nor do they provide even an intimation that having settled these issues as a matter of policy and principle an honorable institution would refuse to engage in bidding wars
Nor is there so much as a hint that using moral restraint when confronted with such options is as admirable in institutions as in individuals
Added to this is the arrogant presumptuous and false albeit fashionable claim that families and prospective students should not take cost into account
Obviously nobody should choose a college just because it is cheap or just because it is expensive
But as a matter of fact families and students should consider both price and cost though difference in selecting a college or university and they should be taught by higher education institutions the wisdom of doing so
Why Consider for example two institutions of roughly equal resources
One charges slightly more for tuition and fees but its educational costs per student are proportionately higher because of more equitable faculty and staff salaries and its noneducational general expenses are lower because of a longstanding policy of routine physical plant maintenance that averts the high cost of recovering from deferred maintenance
Or suppose that one is slightly more expensive because despite similar studentfaculty ratios for the two schools one maintains smaller class sizes and includes in its ratio computation only those faculty actually teaching classes and not those on sabbatical on leave or released for quasiadministrative duties and the like
Or one charges higher tuition or pays lower compensation because it receives financial support from fewer alumni in smaller amounts than the other
What if the two institutions charge exactly the same for tuition but one sets that price high level of debt service while the other has built incomparably better equipped science laboratories and upgrades equipment as often as is financially possible
Suppose that one institution has foolishly and expensively settled extortionate lawsuits when it has done no wrong or incurred great legal expenses when it has
Meanwhile another school has maintained lower costs because of sound policies and wise legal counsel fortitude and a sense of loyalty to its own peer review committees
One can imagine other dimensions of comparison at will
Clearly anyone who knows enough about education to take such considerations into account does so when deciding which institution is better run and run by the kind of people we should want to teach and guide our daughters and sons
To obscure all of this by telling parents that price or cost should not figure in college choice is morally base
Equally base is the practice of telling this to our young when in actual fact how much their families spend on them may very much of their grandparents and so on
Such blithe and selfrighteous counsel is an invitation to selfishness and injustice and an obstacle to the formation of habits of compassion
It is also a direct affront to any hope of their grasping what makes an educational institution worthy of respect and admiration in its priorities and policies
Higher education institutions should conduct themselves so that they are in a position to set responsible tuition fees and they should be financially frank with prospective students and their families
This need not be very complicated but it is indispensable to genuinely rational choice
It also has the merit of recalling colleges and universities to the obvious fact that most individuals and institutions behave better when they feel obliged to be candid about what they do and why they do it
Such conviction is the greatest spring of accountability possible as has been recognized since long before Plato recounted the story of the Ring of Gyges
Furthermore nothing less than thinking and acting about prices and costs in this way can legislators executive branch officials and taxpayers
The higher moral ground on which higher education ought to stand calls for more of course than avoiding logical fallacies and mindless presumptions
Unfortunately much of what passes for ethical discourse in colleges and universities now is as confrontational incivil and tenaciously unreasonable as the vignettes of media ethicists
Who learned what from whom I am not sure but that there are striking Similarities between the respective patterns of behavior no one can deny
In both there are signs of moral bankruptcy the belief that persuasion must be coercive and threatening that our fellow human beingswhether trustees faculty administrators or students have neither the conscience nor the intelligence to appreciate moral evidence and that only passing a specific litmus test on issues such as abortion South African investments gay and lesbian awareness CIA recruiting curriculum reform and so on qualifies anyone as morally decent
Some institutions allow student and faculty involvement in social
Certainly students should become interested in the social and political questions facing a free people but they deserve to be taught that moral fervor is no substitute for diligent and systematic learning
There is little indication that student demonstrations since the s have reflected conscientious study of the relevant issues whether in history philosophy government economics or the sciences
My criticism should not be confused with an attack on moral conviction or freedom of speech rather it describes a pattern of institutional failure that allows students or faculty to set aside and even to obstructthe educational purposes for which a school college or university has been founded
In practice such acquiescence fosters the impression that in matters of moral import passion and action are acceptable substitutes for knowledge and deliberation
The rational pursuit of truth central to teaching scholarship and research is thereby dimmed and educational purposes are slighted or even dismissed
The absence of conscientious study of the relevant subject matter and issues in moral protests against the war in Vietnam and it is equally apparent with respect to the demonstrations concerning South Africa today
In each instance the moral principle to which protesters have appealed is above reproach in the first that America should avoid unjust wars in the second that apartheid is wrong
Nonetheless because applying principles to specific issues requires careful study educational institutions have an obligation to promote a responsible process for reaching judgments
Those who forsake this duty by giving in to student demands for the sake of peace and quiet teach the lesson that moral virtue can be separated from intellectual conscientiousness that noise and pressure are acceptable substitutes for reasoned discourse and finally that the end justifies the means
Students deserve institutions that stand on higher intellectual and moral ground in the classroom as well as outside it
Some institutions following the path of least resistance have allowed classroom and administration buildings to be shut down by student and faculty demonstrators
Such closings replace moral discourse with intellectual inquiry and obstruct institutional duties
The administrative decisions of Yale and Johns Hopkins and other institutions to treat shanties as an acceptable expression of opposition to apartheid provide conspicuous examples of following the path of least resistance at the expense of educational purpose
Building shanties may attract attention but it does not involve applying intelligence to confront important moral and political issues
As John Silber president of Boston University argues to treat students who are perfectly capable of harnessing their mouths to their minds as if they are incapable of articulate speech is a confession of bankruptcy
""
It is also dangerous and selfdefeating to believe that every injustice is intolerable and must be immediately remedied no matter the method
Yet many demonstrations are based on this misconception
A person who can tolerate no injustice can not live in the world because the world always includes conditions of injustice but such a person can not consistently opt for social change either because all substantial change is attended by injustice as well
The others and how to reduce injustice without betraying other ideals such as liberty privacy and civility
These are often hard questions to answer
Surely higher education ought not indulge symbolic expression when it encourages students to think they have done the right thing without making the effort to answer these hard questions
To teach such bad lessons is to forego respect for the civilized intelligence that education both presupposes and hopes to nurture
Indulging members of an educational institution in such political activities poses a greater threat to institutional integrity and the public trust than any possible external pressure
In contrast when I was president of St John s College and concerns about South Africa began to spread across America the administration and the finance committee of the board of visitors and governors took the initiative and undertook an inquiry in the tradition of the comprehensiveness of the liberal arts
That is they did not ask only Should St John s as a protest against apartheid divest itself Africa but also posed the question What should be the relation between social political and moral concerns and the investment policies of a college devoted to the liberal arts The committee invited students faculty alumni staff and board members to submit the best essays editorials and papers they could find on the questions and collected them into a book of several hundred pages for the use of the college community
It then arranged seminars at the college and with alumni groups throughout the country
Asking that no one attend a seminar before reading the book which contained diverse and wellreasoned points of view the committee deliberated for eighteen months through these public forums
By engaging the community in a dialogue among reasonable people of good will the committee provided the opportunity for fruitful disagreement
It sustained civility limited tension between adversaries and revealed the folly of supposing that when two people disagree one of them is invariably bad or morally insensitive
It showed where the arguments Should a college refuse to invest in treasury bills because the United States does business with the Soviet Union Should it ask to examine the portfolios of every donor to insure that none of the income has been generated from South African holdings or from holdings in other countries that violate human rights What about income from businesses whose products and marketing are dangerous or deceitful After these public deliberations the St John s board affirmed its duty to advance the financial interests of the college by honorable investment
It declined to divest on the grounds that the mere sale of shares by one owner to another promised to accomplish nothing in the way of social justice
The board stood by the Sullivan principles and resolved to exercise its prerogatives as a shareholder in matters of corporate policy
All this was possible because the St John s board and administrators were clear about its educational purposes and were resolved to act in fidelity to them and also because the board clearly recognized and taught that it had both
Now I understand that not every institution can undertake such inquiries on this scale
But however their implementation may be tailored to the relevant local circumstances the same principles should be applied
Colleges and universities after all are obliged to be embodiments of the ancient truth that the use of force and threats is never as satisfying to a person of excellent character as a resolution by persuasion and reason and that everyone who loves justice reflects this in his behavior
Some colleges and universities seem to me to be losing sight of the irreplaceable power of the habitual and principled love of justice
They are establishing regulations that have no potential to inspire moral aspiration the durable effort to become a human being functioning at his or her best as legal scholar Lon Fuller put it and which are not even likely to frighten students into behaving well
Thus the University of Michigan the University of Wisconsin the State University of New York at Buffalo the University of North Carolina at that threaten sanctions against students as a means of controlling what are now called acts of insensitivity
These regulations may only succeed in making students suspicious and distrustful of each other and causing progressively greater racial ethnic and gender segregation within universities for reasons of safety
They may also inspire conspiracies of vengeance and vendettas against individuals suspected of having the wrong attitudes and they will certainly indeed already do generate First Amendment controversy as well as acrimonious wrangling among faculty members
Such codes will assuredly blur crucial distinctions between emotionally hurtful speech and genuine violence
These rules however are very different from the rules against disorderly conduct assault and hazing that were quite rightly enforced by the chancellor of the University of Mississippi in September 
The incident to which he responded involved several fraternity members and pledges who stripped two others scrawled racial slurs on their bodies and dumped them at nearby Rust College a largely black institution
The chancellor s decision to bar the offending is required to keep faith with anything resembling the standards of a decent university
As an added benefit the debate that arose subsequent to his decision helped the campus community to discern the error in one student s comment that the entire fraternity should nt have been punished for what a group of members and pledges did
Of course it should have been an institution that can not prevent its members from committing the most egregious violations of serious rules has no right to be spared severe sanction
And the individuals involved in such incidents ought to be expelled because they deserve it and because just punishment shows what the university stands for
In contrast insensitivity rules will do little to teach students what their colleges and universities stand for
They will become signs of hypocrisy in institutions that sweep problems of drug consumption and alcohol abuse under the rug whose programs of study are shallow and lax in expectations of student performance and where absenteeism is ignored cheating is commonplace faculty are are seldom available or facultystudent sexual intimacy is tolerated
And they will not overcome the covert message sent out by faculty curriculum reviews that are incivil and warlike or result in the casting of moral aspersions and accusations of racism
To be respected rules must clearly reflect the broader moral sensibilities of their authors behavior
Where administrators and faculty tolerate all kinds of moral deficiencies that are within their legitimate institutional authority to address students will treat rules as mere expressions of power
They will violate them covertly remorselessly and resentfully and they will look shrewdly for loopholes
Such rules will not even teach that bigotry and prejudice are beneath us unworthy of us contemptible because they are a violation of all reason and because they are a form of blindness in human beings that makes us impenetrable to each other and therefore barbaric in our behavior
They will not teach anyone in Kant s words to take the place and point of view of the other or the other person s skin and walk around in it
""
They will not teach the lesson of Socrates or Gandhi or Frederick Douglass that when one person mistreats another it is the dignity of the wrongdoer that is besmirched not that of the person wronged
They will not teach the lesson of selfreliance that Golda Meir learned as a child from the pogroms in Russia or the freedom from bigotry that she found in Milwaukee
The rules will not teach how the Maccabean sage Eleazar is different from Ivan Boesky or how to identify evil and resist its allure
They will not teach why the prophet Nathan addressed King David in the third person by the Parable of the Lamb in order to draw him to see the evil of his treatment of Uriah and Bathsheba
They will never teach why Nathan did that instead of trying to make a rule
Finally they can not teach in the words of Josiah Royce that it is profoundly mistaken to believe that a neighbor s pain is life dim cold a pale fire beside one s own burning desires
""
Of course it will be objected that the rules are not supposed to teach all this
To this the reply is then spend your time doing what is supposed to teach it
Learning the foundations of habits of decency and a principled life takes study not rules
At most rules address symbols and never underlying vacuums of ignorance and benightedness
Principles are learned when they are learned by exposure to teachers and mentors of fine character by the disciplined study of works worthy of time and devotion by peer pressure for decency by opportunities to reach out to people less fortunate than oneself and by persistent reminders from the intellectual and moral climate of an institution that it expects its members to aspire to become educated men and women who therefore embody genuinely civilized intelligence
This climate takes much more administrative and faculty fortitude and diligence to foster than does the proliferation of implausible the persistent refusal to accept the idea that an educational institution is simply made up of conflicting groups of constituents
""
A college or university is explicitly chartered to fulfill an educational mission that normally involves teaching learning research and study
It is rendered taxexempt for the sake of this purpose
All who are members of its community help to fulfill this charge whether they are students teachers trustees cafeteria employees visiting donors or security personnel
Unless all are joined in this common purpose its efforts will be episodic and fragmented and this affront to mission is exactly what the constituency mentality causes
It endorses the belief that educational institutions are composed of specialinterest groups and teaches that the purpose of governance and management is to adjudicate the conflicting interests of these groups
Once this impoverished vision of an educational institution gains sway the hope of building in the words of Edward Levi a viable and responsible community in which membership signifies pressure duties is shattered
No curriculum can take the place of this persistent hope and aspiration but it can obviously play a major role in fostering it
This will only be true however if the curriculum is conceived not as a collection of courses but as a program of study whose success depends on the faculty members and students who give it life
Even more important a curriculum will never become dynamic if it is based on the idea that how people think and what they think are utterly divisible because only if people learn how to reason together can there be limits to the range of possible disagreement
A genuinely reasonable person can no more blithely embrace a contradiction than blindly argue irrelevantly no more ignore the persuasiveness of rational argument than persist in the foolish consistency that Emerson called the hobgoblin of little minds
Such an individual can no more believe in his own infallibility than assume that his adversaries are everywhere and always utterly wrong
Thus are methods and content irrevocably united today obscure the fact
This provides another important clue to the design of a worthwhile curriculum students deserve to be exposed to minds of the highest rank to works of the greatest power because of their power and never merely because of their authorship
On this fundamental criterion informed by a respect for human history constructing a program of study that ignores the distinctive contributions of a Martin Luther King Jr a Sojourner Truth or a Golda Meir is as much an impossibility as designing one that neglects Socrates Aristotle Augustine or Einstein
The curriculum need not and should not be limited to great booksit should include great art and music and dance great poetry plays and speeches great architecture great mathematical proofs great scientific experiments examples of great eloquence great sacrifice great mistakes and great failure great disagreements great evil even if perpetrated by banal people and great heartache
In their studies students should spend yes depravity
The latter offers a powerful motive for espousing intellectual and moral humility and exposes the dark side of human nature
The former offers a survey of the magnificent range of human possibility and aspiration
Learning both of these lessons is the ethical ideal
The intellectual roots of high moral aspiration are firmly anchored in the high ground of greatness
Dwelling on that ground is what gives a college or university the right to be called a place of higher education
Otherwise it should only be called a place of later education

For anyone who took a university degree more than three or four years ago reading a college catalogue or being told what academics are up to these days is likely to be a disorienting experience
A confusing array of apparently new disciplines has sprung up each calling itself by a name that gives little if any indication of what it might be about
A partial list of these names includes poststructuralism reader response criticism gender studies Lacanian psychoanalysis critical theory theory canonicity semiotics cultural materialism reception aesthetic the New History the New Historicism film theory critical legal studies and comparable approaches in anthropology the sciences and elsewhere
This is certainly a formidable array of terms
But it turns out that the scholarly activities the terms designate are remarkably similar to one another
However much the practitioners of these methodologies pretend to be pursuing new kinds of studies and however arcane their vocabulary they actually share a single elementary foster intellectual disequilibrium
The method is an assault on normative descriptions of reality that is to say on our everyday common sense understanding of what the world is like
But why it may well be asked would anyone want to be involved in such an undertaking The answer lies in politics
For today s newstyled academic scholarship serves as a substitute for radical political action
The political ideal for today s academic would be to participate in an act of revolutionary overthrow or at least one bringing about a radical restructuring of society as it is often phrased
Naturally he is unable to realize this ideal directly
But in recent years means have been created whereby he can enact something like this wish through scholarship
His course of action is based on what may be the single genuine insight of the new methodologies
This is that society rests ultimately on a shared conception of reality among its members
Without a silent consensus on such a matter it is evident resolve matters of law and equity or enter into contracts
Each field of scholarship rests on a similar conceptual contract
The practitioners of the methodologies therefore reason again with justice that to shake the certainties on which their own particular field of scholarship rests is likely to destabilize that field
Such a destabilization has in fact been accomplished in the humanistic and social science disciplines and to some extent in the sciences causing considerable dismay among traditional scholars
In fact so thoroughly have such scholars been caught up in defending the traditional methodologies that most of them have failed to recognize the challenge they are facing for what it really is namely a political gesture
This gesture amounts to being an academic imitation of a politically revolutionary act
Radical academics believe that the university is structured in the same way as they believe society to be structured that is with a ruling class on the one side and an exploited class on the other
They conceive of the university as ruled tenured professors
The exploited class consists of the younger untenured professors and the students
By challenging the kind of scholarship practiced by the older professors the practitioner of one of the new methodologies fancies himself as striking a blow on behalf of the downtrodden
It would be an exaggeration to say that every academic who practices one of the new methodologies thinks of himself as a revolutionary actor
Some academics as I have already mentioned want to restructure rather than overthrow society
Others especially graduate students and beginning instructors may not be aware of the political attitudes underlying the methodology they have chosen to practice
Just as a political movement includes both strategists and distributors of fliers so is it with the new methodologies each has its theorists on the one extreme and its devoted readers and followers on the other
Similarly just as in a political context there are those who grasp the ideological purposes of the opposition and those whose concerns remain limited to the local and the practical of the new methodologies
Some understand the politics and some do not
Still others understand but prefer to deny the politics
That however is a matter beyond the scope of the present essay
""
Once one understands the politics of the new methodologies it is relatively easy to see how each of them works
I propose briefly to examine four methodologies deconstruction feminist criticism the New Historicism and film theory
At first sight the four would appear to be as widely separated and seemingly unrelated to one another as could be imagined
Each has its own barely penetrable terminology and claims to employ a unique analytic method
But the terms encountered in going from one to another of the four turn out to be many ways of representing the same few things
In fact all four methodologies come down to being versions of a single surprisingly elementary concept that of class struggle
Each of the four methodologies represents class struggle on the same model of exploitation both an exploiting and an exploited class
Just as with the class analysis of the university furthermore the sins of the exploiters have to do not with economic or political dominance as they would in the Marxist model that is obviously being imitated but rather with intellectual style
Each of the new methodologies designates the intellectual style it abhors by a different new jargonish term
But as the account that follows tries to make dear the methodologies do not really make discoveries about reality
Their purpose is to create a political drama in which their practitioners first invent an exploiting and an exploited class and then in a kind of symbolic imitation of political revolutionism proceed to denigrate the one and identify with the other
Deconstruction
Among contemporary methodologies deconstruction a mode of reading and discussing literature is consistently identified by practitioners of the other methodologies as their source and inspiration
The central focus of deconstruction as represented in the writings of Jacques Derrida is an attack on something it they mean by logocentrism for the signature gesture of their movement is never to define or be entirely clear about anything
Nevertheless it gradually does grow clear that logocentrism designates a supposedly mistaken belief in the stability of language and phenomena
According to deconstructionist analysis the logocentrist deceives himself that the world is graspable by intellect and communicable by language
He naively believes as Jonathan Culler puts it in his admiring account of deconstruction in thought truth reason
For this he is at once both ridiculed and deplored
For all its apparent philosophical sophistication the deconstructionist attack on logocentrism rests on a garbled extension of certain analyses found in the lecture notes of the early twentiethcentury language theorist Ferdinand de Saussure
In consequence of this garbling the leading assumptions of deconstruction are seriously flawed if not worthless as among others John Ellis has shown in Against Deconstruction reviewed by Norman Fruman in this issue of Academic Questions
But even if one sets theoretical problems aside in extremes of political bias
For logocentrism proves to be not so much a philosophical category as a way of identifying and stigmatizing something as bourgeois
Rather than merely being dealt with as a mistaken approach to reality logocentrism is taken to be the crucial means of bourgeois control over society
Realityoriented language deconstructionists would have us believe functions to impose a version of reality favorable to the bourgeoisie permitting it to maintain its hegemony or control over the lower classes
Derrida himself takes this melodramatic politicization of the language question still further claiming that the bourgeois hegemony extends over the whole globe
As he puts it logocentrism is really a form of imperialism it is nothing but the most original and powerful ethnocentrism in the process of imposing itself upon the world
The implication of such a statement is that when deconstruction attacks logocentrism it stands forth as a champion of the oppressed Third World along with anyone else the bourgeoisie can be thought of as oppressing
Feminist potentials of the deconstructionist assault
Rather than merely complain about men they could stigmatize the belief system that men had supposedly foisted on the world
Their term for this system is patriarchy
They accuse patriarchy of employing rigid logical categories of thought that stifle women s allegedly more intuitive instinctual kind of thought
Obviously patriarchy is simply logocentrism transposed to the realm of gender
Its characteristics are the same and its oppressive action is the same except that women are substituted for the proletariat and the Third World as the victims
As with logocentrism the concept of patriarchy quite falls apart under theoretical scrutiny
In the first place there are no such things as identifiably male and female modes of thought
If there were the feminist analysis of history would force the conclusion that all culture and civilization are exclusively the creation of men with women having been nothing more than inarticulate bystanders throughout history
So supine a role for women does the concept of patriarchy imply in women could not possibly assert themselves in anything
There would be no theoretical way for example to account for the effectiveness of the contemporary women s movement nor for its forceful use of language
Theoretical problems aside feminist scholarship in history literary criticism and sociology devotes itself to constructing versions of patriarchy whether it be in the actions of feudal lords modem societies or the plots or critical analyses of novels
In every instance women are presumed to have been casualties of actions or thought now categorized as patriarchal
The feminists claim to be practicing a new kind of scholarship but are simply enacting a version of deconstruction s attack on logocentrism
Since they believe with the deconstructionists that the social system s stability rests on its dominant mode of thought whenever they identify something as patriarchal they are really performing a deconstructionlike revolutionary gesture or at the very least a gesture of protest
The New Historicism
Patriarchal man if he actually existed would recognize his double in the personality he would if this other new personality type actually existed
The New Historicists claim to have identified a bourgeois subject sometimes referred to as the humanist subject
According to New Historicists and to cultural materialists the modem personality a deplorable thing was formed some time during the Renaissance
At that juncture an emergent selfcentered selfish harddriving personality type pushed from the scene a dreamier more sensitive more humanly integrated personality
The lash of necessity to succeed in the bourgeoisdominated modem world then aborning produced the bourgeois historical subject and with him virtually all of the ills of Western history since that time
Not surprisingly the New Historicism proves to be as theoretically unsound as deconstruction and feminism
It does not and can not produce any evidence for the existence of the bourgeois personality as Richard Levin has shown
Nor do its practitioners agree on what constitutes this personality any more than they do on the characteristics of the personality type it is supposed to a version of patriarchal man who is in turn an embodiment of logocentrism
As for the new historicism it is little more than yet another way of attacking Western liberal society
This political purpose becomes clear when just as with Derrida and the logocentric type a leading New Historicist abandons history and theory for a direct attack on the present arrangement of things
Bourgeois discourse he writes disguises a lust for communal suicide an absolute act of universal sovereignty
At this very moment therefore the bourgeois humanist subject is rushing all of us toward the logical end of all its characteristics and desires a nuclear denouement
It follows that for at least one New Historicist attacking the bourgeoisie is not only another symbolic revolutionary act but also an urgent bid to prevent an imminent nuclear war
Film Theory
Far more explicit about its political intentions is the fourth and seemingly purest form of theoretical discourse on my list film theory
Its purpose is propagandistic it seeks to use movies in the service of political struggle
Such a project not surprisingly requires the invention of yet another equivalent of logocentrism this time located in moviemaking techniques
As bourgeois humanist man was supposedly preceded by a more sensitive personality type the movies too once existed in an ideal utopian moment
Simpler purer movies made during the silent era before featured nonlinearity and acknowledgment of the depthillusion
According to contemporary film theory early movies did not tell their stories in strict sequence and they did not attempt to deceive by pretending to be accurate representations of reality
Their superior honesty presumably derived from their having been made for the early twentiethcentury proletariat whose members flocked to see them in an expression of class solidarity
As Rodowick explains it the preindustrial phase of cinema history was mandated by a proletarian public whose relationship to film as popular art was only later supplanted by the man is yet again the villain
In the twentieth century he is still not yet satiated by his success in stamping out the prebourgeois humanist subject or by stifling female expression through the imposition of patriarchy
Nor has he been rendered impotent by adhering to the selfdelusions of logocentrism
Instead he has gone ahead sinisterly to introduce in the movies both coherent narrative and an appearance of reality
As a result the glorious golden age of primitive cinema came to an end with devastating results for all but a few foreignlanguage and avantgarde films
Film theory responds to this invented situation with yet another symbolic overthrow of the bourgeois order a vigorous attack on the coherence and illusion of life projected by commercial movies
Like the other new methodologies in today s academy film theory represents itself as being at the cutting edge of contemporary philosophical developments
Rodowick for example describes film theory as a particular triangulation of textual semiotics psychoanalysis and Althusserian Marxism
As the last of down to the familiar and oldfashioned Marxist fixing of blame on the bourgeoisie
Whether contemporary theorists start out with logocentrism patriarchy the bourgeois humanist subject or depthillusion in filmmaking they invariably end up with a preconceived melodrama of bourgeois oppression
One need not accept the cliches of bourgeois oppression to agree that much depends on what the members of a society believe and do not believe to be true
The new theorists have demonstrated moreover that if the economic and political systems of the West have become difficult to criticize from a radical perspective they are highly vulnerable to attack through their belief system
The traditional scholarly disciplines in particular have been reduced to confused silence in the face of TOOLONG assaults
In contrast the new theorists have so far had to sustain few attacks on their own certainties thanks to their long having shielded themselves behind a virtual Berlin Wall of obfuscatory terminology
Once it becomes clear though that behind that wall every edifice presents the same going to emerge
Deconstruction feminism the New Historicism film theory and their allied methodologies one can predict are destined to collapse well before the belief system or the society they have been attempting to undermine

Figurative Incompetence A Thesis
SUPPOSE YOU make a metaphor and I do nt comprehend it
Or again suppose you tell a joke and I do nt laugh
In both cases something has not come across something has not gotten from you to me
What does this show It shows that we are different certainly at least with regard to this metaphor and this joke at least on this occasion
Is that all it shows And how important is that that we are different in these respects You will surely think me different from you but might you also think me less than you or less than you would like me to be Could you be disappointed in me And if you were could you be justified in that opinion of me A sober question which seems to threaten the fun in thinking about humor and figurative language but I think there is no real worry because these are wealthy topics with too much resilience a deft touch a little philosophical foreplay may make the real thing even more satisfying
I will do my best
My favorite way of thinking of these things both offering metaphors and telling jokes is in terms of a context of community
They are typically devices or occasions for establishing modes of intimacy ways of sharing which render a group of people more than a collection of individual different people
When a person reaches another in this sense of sharing something I call that pair or a larger group if there is one a community and I think of the members sharing as an intimacy
In fact the group can be smaller than a pair
One can do this alone
It is a way of reaching oneself of establishing contact with oneself
In the last couple of years I have been trying to understand this intimacy the forms it takes and why it matters to us
Here I would like to speculate a bit about the use of metaphors and jokes
The character of the intimacy and the nature of the community depend upon what kind of thing is being shared and upon what kind of device is being used
If your metaphor or joke fails with me in either case there are two points at which the thing may have broken down
If your metaphor escapes me perhaps I just do nt see what you re getting at
But perhaps I do and I simply do nt agree with you
If your joke does nt tickle me perhaps I just do nt get it
But perhaps I do and I simply do nt find it funny
We had better have some concrete examples to help with these subtleties
My father used a particular phrase when describing a specific deficiency in beer
When referring to some new brands of beer and sometimes to an off bottle of a familiar brand my father would say It tastes green or It tastes a little green
""
I heard this remark many times over a number of years
Often it was answered for instance by a good family friend Dick Rogers who would say You re right Sam it s green or sometimes I do nt know Sam it tastes all right to me
""
Although I have tried and tried by talking and by tasting I have never known what these men were talking about
I often agreed that the beer was nt perfect
I found it flat or stale or bitter but none of those is what green means
I frankly do nt care too much whether we like the same beers although it helps when we order in bulk but I desperately want to know what a beer tastes like when it tastes green
There may well have been equal frustration on my fathers side as he noted that having supported my education for a good twenty years he found me still green taste of beer
This example tends to blur the distinction between knowing what a word means and recognizing what it applies to but that is a distinction made to be blurred
You may wonder whether my failure is to know what my father was talking about or to know how some beer tasted to him
To work the distinction we need a different example
Here is a passage by Saul Bellow that uses metaphor to describe Chicago
What advantage do you see here
There s the big advantage of backwardness
By the time the latest ideas reach Chicago they re worn thin and easy to see through
You do nt have to bother with them and it saves lots of trouble
""
You might not follow this that is you might not see what the speaker is talking about
If you do get it suppose you take it like this intellectual paraphernalia typically comes to America from elsewhere
Recently for instance there have been Lacantype and Germany and French theories of literature of the structuralist poststructuralist and deconstructionist persuasions
This stuff tends to enter the country on the east coast in New York New Haven and Boston and sometimes further down the coast Baltimore for instance and at a couple of points in California
Later it makes its way to the intellectual circles of Chicago but by then what may have seemed novel profound and exciting is showing itself to be mainly puerile sterile and gaseous
If you take it that way you are still free to think that the author is wrong and in that sense not to get it
You see what the speaker is getting at but you think that as a matter of fact the latest ideas reach Chicago as soon as anywhere and that perhaps some even come from there or you think that Chicagoans are at least as much suckers for this stuff as anyone else and they do nt see through it at all or stuff and that there s nothing for Chicagoans or anyone else to see through
Imagine that you are the maker of that metaphor and that I am the recalcitrant hearer
What will distress you more That I do nt agree with you or that I do nt understand you at all although if I did I might well agree
The same questions can be asked about the failures of jokes
Here s one for the holy season
What is Sacramento
It is the stuffing in a Catholic olive
If you had the temerity to tell that joke what would distress you more if it failed that your hearer just did nt get it or that he got it and did nt find it funny
At the risk of contributing to lame philosophy lamed by itself for it constructs rigorous definitions exclusive distinctions and symbolic contrivances as an aid to movement when in fact it might stroll freely without a crutch at the risk of doing to need a metaphor which has both aided and paralyzed modern thought
I mean the notion of outer and inner the idea that some things are outside us and some are inside
There is the world outside me which I gaze on and try to describe and there is my inner self
To the extent that this metaphor is tolerable we may hope to categorize the successful uses of metaphors and jokes in terms of how much outside or inside ourselves they take us
These successes on my view occasion communities of intimacy
If I am permitted the use of another dubious distinction that of subjectiveobjective I will say that these successes tend to be more objective or more subjective and I will say the same about failures
If I understand your metaphor but do nt agree with it then we do not share exactly the same world for you find something in the world and I understand your description of it but I ca nt find it
This chance to cohabit
We can nonetheless go looking together
We both know what old threadbare ideas are and although we do nt just now agree on where they re to be found we could hope to come to some agreement
If I do nt understand your metaphor then we may well not know whether we agree about the facts for I do nt know what facts you are alleging
I can not go looking or tasting for green beer because I do nt know when I ve found it
I have undoubtedly tasted beer which is what my father called green beer but that fact notwithstanding green beer is not part of my world
And this is different from the way in which unicorns are not part of my world
Unicorns we might say are not part of the world
But they figure in my world just as say giant pandas do
Like everyone I have never seen a unicorn
Suppose that like I have then never seen a unicorn never seen a panda and never tasted green beer
But if I think of my world as the totality of my possible experiences then unicorns and pandas belong to that totality and green beer does not and so I say that unicorns and pandas are a part of my world but green beer is not
I wish it were
In both kinds of metaphorical breakdown you and I fail to get together
The second case however the one in which I do nt take your meaning is less objective more subjective than the first
I mean it has less to do with the outer world than with the way in which we are trying to talk together about the world
If you resist my way of putting this difference is that because you do nt think these things are as I say or because you do nt think my way of describing them makes sense
A final note about the two levels what level we are on or are not on together
Suppose I refuse the metaphor about old ideas coming to Chicago
If you determine that I understand the metaphor you are likely to suppose that my refusal shows that I disagree about the facts
But maybe not or not so simply
I can grasp your metaphor without my having a sense of it perfectly congruent with yours
Perhaps what I think is that indeed this intellectually lightweight fadism often plays itself out near the coasts but that this is to say that the steady scrutiny of the sun of critical intelligence bleaches superficial colors and so these ideas are not so much worn thin as they are faded out
It is not clear now whether our disagreement is objective or subjective whether it concerns mainly the facts or how to describe the facts
What is clear is that the distinction between the truly objective and the merely subjective is not such a good distinction to be lumbered with
As with a failed metaphor a failed
If your joke does nt make me laugh then either I do nt find anything funny in this alleged joke or I do see what is funny but personally am unmoved by it
In the former case I do nt find anything jokey in your story and so I can not see why or how it could make anyone laugh although I may have evidence that it does
Would you accept the idea that such a joke is not part of my world This would mean that not only do I not laugh at it but also I ca nt imagine myself laughing at it
That is like being unable to imagine tasting green beer
I hope for a deep and simple sense of imagine
In that sense when I ca nt imagine something for myself I ca nt imagine it for anyone
That is I ca nt imagine it period
This fanciful formulation recalls Wittgenstein
He says The world of the happy man is a different one from that place for thorough exegesis of Wittgenstein but I will note one possible line of development
The world of the happy man is a different one from that of the unhappy man seems a radical pronouncement but it is not obvious how that could be given the context of the Tractatus
Wittgenstein has already said What brings the self into philosophy is the fact that the world is my world
Since the world is the totality of facts it seems to follow that the totality of facts is my totality of facts
But let us not go into that
Instead let us go into this if the world is my world and I am not you then my world is not your world
If you are a happy man and I am an unhappy man then of course your world will be a different one from my world but so will your world be a different one from mine if we are both happy unless like in being happy although I take a suggestion of the first line of Anna Karenina to be that there is no more than one happy family and probably not even that
The difference in our worlds is not due to your happiness and my unhappiness that is just an incidental feature
Then why does Wittgenstein note it
How about this suppose I am both the happy man and the unhappy man
Perhaps I am both a happy man sometimes and an unhappy man sometimes and maybe I am sometimes a happy man and an unhappy man all at once
Then the world of the happy me is not the same as the world of the unhappy me and there is a fragmentation of both my self and my world
A disintegration
According to Wittgenstein one s happiness or unhappiness has to do with the world but it is not a matter of the world itself
The world after all is the totality of facts
""
happy man and the unhappy man although there is no way in which one could know this in terms of the solipsism of the Tractatus unless one were oneself both the happy man and the unhappy man
Leonard Linsky has a poignant penetrating explanation when he says that Wittgenstein conceives the unhappy man as being not sad but depressed
When a man is sad it is often because of the facts and if those facts were different for instance if someone had not died or if someone had returned the man s love or if there had been more rain then the man would not be sad but when a man is depressed there is nothing he wants of the facts that make up the world so it would not matter to his depression if they were altered
I am not wedded to Wittgenstein s idea of what the world is and even if I were I would still not like to adopt Wittgenstein s idea of what can count as I am therefore not so concerned to distinguish what in me is a matter of the contents of my world and what is a matter of how that world strikes me
Thus I make no objection to saying that the fact of green beer was part of my father s world but is not part of mine
I am not going to resolve this and I am not going to have much more to do with Wittgenstein here
I mention him only in order to beg at least a provisional license for speaking about the different worlds of those who laugh and those who do nt
Not to find the joke in a story is to have a different world from someone who does find it
When these two people confront one another in the context of the telling of this joke I think the situation is the same as one Wittgenstein describes
We also say of some people that they are transparent to us
It is however important as regards this observation that one we learn this when we come into a strange country with entirely strange traditions
And what is more even given a mastery of the country s language we do not understand the people
And not because of not knowing what they are saying to themselves we can not find ourselves in them
I do not understand a person I can not imagine him
I can not understand what a person says I can not imagine saying that
This is to say that I can not find a place in the world for this person because I can not make his world my world
A case like this is most likely perhaps when the joke incorporates especially arcane features
These are typically bits of specialized knowledge or information or lines in another language
The what is Sacramento joke is like that and so are these
What s round and purple and commutes to work An Abelian grape
Where does the Lone Ranger take dump to the dump dump dump
I have taken to calling jokes like these ones which require some special knowledge for their appreciation hermetic
But it is not always a piece of information that s critical at least not a piece which could easily have been supplied in advance
This oneliner for instance which I adapt from something I heard Mort Sahl say has frequently failed me with children
If George Bush had run unopposed he would have been defeated
With some children it has not been that I could nt succeed in explaining it to them so that they would then laugh but that I have nt been able to explain it at all I have nt been able to show that there is any joke there
The same thing can happen with adults
It is not likely to happen with an adult in the case of this joke but in general children are as able as adults to recognize jokes which they themselves do nt cases however different they are as failures of community at the level of understanding
I ca nt see the joke in your joke and so I fail to enter the community of those who do
This is like my failure to understand what it means for beer to be green
l can not make the words my own
I can not make them come alive for me
The difference between the uncomprehended metaphor and the undetected joke seems to be this if I did understand the green beer metaphor then I could proceed with you to the beer with a tongue toward checking its ripeness
That is I would move out
If I did understand the hermetic joke then I could proceed to laugh
That is I would move in
This move in when it happens is a move into a community of feeling
This is as subjective as things become
When it works when one of us brings it off by telling a successful joke to the may not be enough to redeem the world but it is a very sweet intimacy
And when a joke does nt work the result can be very bitter
When I offer you a metaphor or tell you a joke I present you with something
If it does not work with you I will be disappointed but I can be disappointed in myself or my material or I can be disappointed in you
If I am especially confident in my material then my presentation is a kind of test of you and I may rightly or wrongly consign the entire failure to you
What I do is to find it a fault in you that you are unable to enter the relevant community
It may console me to think you thus deficient but it will be little consolation unless I am a fierce egomaniac or a ferocious misanthrope for I must then think you so different that I am alone one of a kind
I have been talking about my heart is with the jokes at least in this paper
Let us say that there are three species of verbal overture with which you may be presented literal descriptions metaphorical descriptions and jokes
By any conventional measure philosophical or otherwise jokes are the least important and they are typically thought to be the least serious
That is because they are the least objective involving the least degree of testing verification confirmation etc
We can sketch the differences in objectivity quotient
Six abbreviations will help to save space PREFORMATTED TABLE
I assume when pondering this sketch that understanding comes first and occurs in the mind
The arrow shows subsequent movement farther in so to speak in responding to a joke farther out in checking the world for the referent of a literal description
In the case of a metaphorical description I show a double arrow indicating two directions for those who believe that understanding a metaphor requires a special adjustment no doubt anticipate my moral
I will not assert that the subjective side is the more important but I will urge you to consider that it is as important as the more objective
I need to know your inner self and my need to know that is at least as great as my need to know the objectivity of the world and it is certainly as important to my own humanity
If there is a thesis here it is this
When we fail to come together in any of these four ways understanding a metaphor applying a metaphor detecting a joke laughing at a joke none of these failures is clearly more important or troubling than any other
In particular the most subjective of the lot not being able to laugh at the same joke although both of us see it is not trivial
Some of the finest words on this kind of tragedy are from a recent story
The person who speaks first has come to the end of leave him in danger of losing his job and worse
The people who threaten him do not know why he has done what he has done and he proposes to tell them
He says I shall explain before everyone the things that took place
If people are human they will have to laugh at it
He is answered As you like
But you ll learn either that people are nt human or that you do nt know what humans are like
They will not laugh
One must read the whole story to taste the bitter flavor of hopelessness in this exchange
The people speaking are characters in a story by Milan Kundera
The idea that knowing what others are like is to know what it is to be human and that this is of a piece with knowing oneself is present in the works of another Czech writer more than half a century earlier What have I in common with Jews I have hardly anything in common with content that I can breathe
This is from a diary entry by Kafka
This is a mysterious and terrifying idea the feeling that one has nothing in common with oneself
Is this how one would feel if one s self and one s world were disintegrated in the way suggested by the reading of Wittgenstein on the bifurcation of the happy man and the unhappy man which imagines that I am myself both an unhappy man and a happy man I owe to my friend Daniel Herwitz the excellent suggestion that Kafka s passage can be read to mean that it is because he has nothing in common with Jews that he feels nothing in common with himself that in order to feel at one with himself Kafka senses that he would have to feel at one with Jews and Kafka will not do that
The idea that I am trying to locate in Kundera and Kafka is the insistence that to feel that I know myself I must think that I know my human self and that in
When this implication is thrown into question by experiences with people who are enigmas to me then my feeling of self knowledge is also impugned
The idea is mine but I would like to find it in others
It is already a comfort that when I was first formulating the idea my friend Ioannis Manuelides put me on to the Kundera story believing that there was something similar there
It is a question of knowing what people are like
This is not however simply knowing what people are like as one might know say what dogs are like
It is to know what it is to be human
That means that it is related to knowing what oneself is like
What is this relation How does my knowing what people are like relate to my knowing what I am like I am tempted to say that the relation is identity that to know what others are like is to know what oneself is like
But that is an overstatement it because it is a blunt denial of another temptation which is to say that my knowledge of what others are like is based on my knowledge of what I am like as if I were making an inference to an hypothesis about others
I can make such an inference
I might note that a certain joke told by me or by someone else makes some people laugh
Then taking you to be like those people in relevant respects I try the joke on you and it works
I try the joke on the basis of an inference that you are like those other laughers
I can do this when I am myself indifferent to the joke when it does nt make me laugh
To use a joke in this way to have hypothesized that it will reach you when it does nt reach me is to engage in what I have elsewhere called a kind of fraudulence
I may however decide to try a joke with you do this when I am the other laugher
A joke makes me laugh I judge that you are relevantly like me I try the joke on you
It is a mistake to suppose that all cases of this kind are alike with the difference that in some of them I am myself the prior laugher but that otherwise all the cases are the same with my inferring what you are like from what someone else perhaps me is like
This model is false to what I take to be the phenomenology of community
When we are laughing together at the same joke we are fellows we are alike
I find you in myself I find myself in you
If I adapt an insight of Stanley Cavell s I will say that in this particular mode of intimacy my knowledge of what you are like is of a piece with my acknowledgment of what I am like
It is not so easy for me to know what I knowing what it means to be me
As Hillel asked If I am only for myself then what am I
There is a terror that follows the collapse of the false security one feels at the idea that one might hide in oneself
It is not knowledge but ignorance that comes with isolation
Braving it out alone is a way of cowering within oneself and it is the worst kind of epistemological and affective bankruptcy
It is the situation of being nowhere
The idea that isolation is no better than nothing and may even be worse appears in many formulations and if we recognize it in all its guises we find it in an astonishing array of texts
Kant documents it as the condition of being free only negatively and not yet able to make that freedom amount to anything
Kant s description echoes those given by Rousseau Spinoza and Aristotle and an even earlier narration is the one in Exodus where the people are made to learn that of Sinai is needed to complete the freedom begun with deliverance
A seemingly more sheerly epistemological description is given by Descartes when he observes with a disarming and frightening casualness that I can be absolutely certain with no possibility of any doubt that I am and still as yet have absolutely no idea what I am
I am speaking of all these ways of being alone as if they were the same
Surely there are differences investing your sense of the world in a figure of speech and finding no one to take your meaning having an aim in life which has nothing to do with anyone else s aims reposing unqualified confidence in your own existence but finding nothing to connect you with the existence of anyone or anything else
And yet the boundaries that distinguish semantic psychological moral and epistemological isolation from one another may not be entirely distinct if indeed those boundaries do not turn out to be a grand illusion
Getting across the sea is enough to to make them a People
Getting rid of external constraints says Kant is enough to give us a chance but it takes more if our lives together are to harmonize
Descartes s knowledge that he exists is a respite from doubt but it is only in his subsequent discovery of what he is that he unearths the key which unlocks the door to knowledge of the world and its creatures
Hillel has already connected these things when he asks not who am l or why am I but if I am only for myself then what am I
The sense that epistemological moral and emotional isolation are not so different from one another indeed that they may be three Halloween masks on the same empty face is clearest perhaps in artistic works
It is displayed in Gaslight in the face of Ingrid Bergman near the end when freed of the assault of Charles Boyer she stands outside drained finally completely mad
And it is heard in sad mad Janis Joplin s voice when she sings Kris Kristofferson s line Freedom s just another word for nothing left to lose
""
If my knowledge of others goes with my acknowledgment of my self then perhaps I can not get in touch with my self without establishing a relation with an other
This relation constitutes the transcendental condition for making up a joke
The authentic creation of a joke is an event in which one truly tells a new joke to oneself
It is a discovery of one s own sensibility an acknowledgment to oneself of oneself
The shared laughter at a joke is a unique intimacy
It is not the same as the semantic moral and epistemological communities I have mentioned nor is it a substitute for them
It is an emblem of those other intimacies and a kind of evidence for their possibility
You feel a bond with a fellow laugher and this feeling fortifies your hope to are not always alone then perhaps we might often reach one another in various ways for various purposes or for no purpose at all
Your relief at finding that they do laugh will not completely allay your anxiety at the prospect that they do not understand you or the world in the way you understand yourself and the world
And it should nt allay that anxiety
We have much more to do together than only to laugh
But if we can laugh together then we may hope to do more we might live together and not just side by side
Listen once more to that awful remark As you like
But you ll learn either that people are nt human or that you do nt know what humans are like
They will not laugh
Think of that
Take it seriously
Consider the horror in having to realize that people are not human or that you do nt know what humans are like
It is unbearable
This away from the horror and contemplate what it means when your joke does go through
When your joke works and they do laugh you secure a measure of conviction that people are human and that you do know what they are like
Your success proves nothing
This is the point Hume saw with terrifying clarity but it surely does something as Hume also saw when he rejoiced in being a natural man
You can not prove that your joke is funny but you can hold it out and share it with another human who finds it as you do who laughs
That is a wonder I think fit to match the horror risked
Pursuing that wonder I dare say is a project which is part of God s work
It is a consolation

A Driving Examination A Story
HE WAS AN old man all the time I knew him from the very beginning and so he never seemed to age not for thirty years
The only others who have been like that for me were Picasso Stravinsky and Bertrand Russell
But I never knew them and I did know Max
He was my grandfather
He was past sixty when I was born and so he seemed an old man to me from the start
He had a memory that went back time out of mind out of my mind anyway and by the end of his life it was out of his mind too
When I was first old enough to really know him in the forties just after the war he was sharp as a tack
And he drove
He had a modest car well kept but far below his means
His entire life was well kept and well within his means him he was the owner of the Max Cohen General Store several properties in the town and three farms within a few miles in three different directions from town
It was in the store that I came to know him Cohen s Store as everyone called it and as my uncle who worked with his father Max would say in a loud voice when answering the phone
I saw Max in his store nearly every day after school
In that tiny town the commercial area the business district as signs say in those towns was only two blocks from my home
My father s office an insurance agency was next to the blacksmith s shop directly across the one main street from Cohen s Store
I would look in on my father and then walk across the street to hang out in the general store
My earliest memories are from just after the Second World War
At that time my father was restarting his insurance business after his time in Max s store
He soon moved to the little building across the street leaving his father and brother in the general store and that is how I remember things
I loved the store
It was a real general store
It sold groceries and meat my uncle was the butcher dry goods of all kinds hardware and nails and coal oil in the back and gasoline out of a hand pump on the street in front of the store
My grandfather was nearly always in the store usually at the counter near the front
He did not seem to me to do much
The visible labor stocking shelves labeling cans candling eggs cutting meat all this was done either by my uncle or by someone working under his direction
My grandfather took money at the cash register and wrote up charge slips and otherwise he made conversation with the customers
He also did business but I was unaware of that until I was a teenager half a dozen and other properties lending money buying and selling notes and the like
I was unaware of that business and so far as I could tell he was simply being Cohen of Cohen s Store
During almost all of every day but Sunday he was in the store
I knew of only two things that took him away besides lunch and haircuts
They were trips down the street for short sessions in the card room where he played an hour or so of euchre and trips to his farms
He drove to the farms and he often took me with him
They were casual trips of inspection
There was never any stopping just very slow driving past the fields of corn soybeans and wheat slow enough to see how the crops were doing and occasionally to take note of newly erected farm buildings and newly painted old ones
He never drove fast especially not on the gravel farm roads and he was a competent driver
age that he was not a natural driver
I might not have noticed his awkwardness so soon if I had not had my father to compare
My father was a splendid natural driver one of those men who drive as intuitively as they walk
A few years ago my father suffered a stroke and now his walking is forced and mechanical but his driving is still fluid
Unlike his father my father learned to drive when he was young
A family photograph from the early thirties shows him with two friends about to go shotgun hunting
The other two are in the back seat of the opentop car my father is behind the wheel
Painted on the side of the car is Cohen s Store
Phone 
If you phoned my uncle would answer Cohen s Store
It was Max s delivery car and my father was its main driver
Later when his insurance business was doing well my father would drive his customers on farms all over the county
His early start and then all that practice had made my father a consummate driver by the time I began to ride with him
Max started much later in life and never drove very much and I noted his lesser skill
He had mastered the operation of his car at least for his purposes
It was a Dodge
Like all cars at the time it had a manual transmission but it was of an advanced kind called fluid drive I think and it did nt require so much clutch work
It was in that car that Max and I would drive to see the farms and sometimes once every two months or so we would go to a movie together
We had to go to a neighboring town either six miles west or ten miles east because there was no longer a movie house in our town
When Max and I went out to a movie he drove even more slowly these movie drives were on a paved highway instead of gravel farm roads because we went to movies at night and Max drove even more cautiously in the dark
Max was an immigrant
He was born in the s somewhere near the GermanPolish border
Max himself was unsure where he d come from he called it only the old country and the fact that in his naturalization papers he renounces all allegiance to the Czar of Russia seems to establish nothing
The officials who handled those forms were very personal and highly informal
Max entered the United States when he was a boy coming all alone
He came straight to Chicago and began a career as a downstate peddler bringing horsedrawn wagonloads of household items on trips south from Chicago
He settled in central Illinois operating a general store out in the country
When it burned he built another in our town and did business there for more than fifty years
He prospered
He brought a wife the miles from Chicago
then my father and then she died just after my father finished high school
That was before and from then on he lived as a widower
He was living alone except for his housekeeper and her daughter in his big house when I first knew him
I knew he was my grandfather but I knew it as some children do without knowing what it means
He seemed to me detached in contact with everything his presence pervaded the town pushing outward from his store right through the short streets whose properties he sometimes owned and out into the surrounding farmland but in contact without being connected
He seemed absolutely independent even outside time for he seemed old but unaging
He spoke an independent speech
He had an immigrant s accent which I heard nowhere else and would not hear again until years later when I d moved away
He called his accent and every other broken or accented English a brogue
My father uses the word brogue and an affectionate one
Max always seemed to prefer driving with company and although he did make solitary drives when he had a companion he often preferred to be the passenger
In the beginning of course I was a little boy and he did the driving but once I was sixteen and a legal driver I often drove him
My father would give me the family car so that I could drive Max where he wanted to go
Once I was taking him to get a haircut
The barber was in a town a few miles southwest and our route took us past one of Max s farms and then on through the farmland
As the road neared the end of a cornfield I was driving slowly
Among my friends most of them farm boys who had been driving tractors and pickup trucks since they were very young it was a matter of pride to be able to drive fast over the country roads
This can be difficult
The gravel is often tires in the ruts
The road is narrow with no shoulder and sometimes steep drainage ditches on the sides
It becomes necessary to drive on the edge of the ditch if you meet another car
I was learning to drive fast and I was especially proud of my ability to stay at seventy mph when driving over one of the bridges which cross the creeks that go through that fertile land
Atop the bridge would be two planks each about two feet wide and I would have to keep the car straight with a wheel on each plank or the car would swerve out of control
My pride notwithstanding I was driving slowly that day
It was prudent because fast driving on gravel roads throws up rocks which can scar the car and it was my parents car
And it was decent because Max had always driven slowly so that we could both look
Now we were looking at the line where the cornfield ended and a soybean field began
A fence ran between the
In the old days said Max sometimes a fence would be hung on trees instead of posts
""
I noticed that the trees were evenly spaced although the fence was attached not to them but to posts
I remember when those trees were planted he said
About sixty years ago
""
I was astounded
Max had come to the time when he often recalled sixty years ago with brilliant clarity and could not remember yesterday at all
I was seventeen and too stupid to realize that this meant that it was time for me to learn about sixty years ago and that Max did nt need to remember yesterday because he could leave that to me
My father was giving me the car more and more often in order to have me drive Max and both he and my mother frequently drove him
The only one of us not to drive Max was my brother eight years younger
By the time he was he then became Max s principal driver
The reason we were doing so much driving with Max although I did not know this at the time was that my parents were increasingly concerned about Max s own driving
He was becoming erratic and even dangerous
It was his age
This is the right description I think and not one in terms of his physical or mental powers as if we know that those things are different or even what they are
He was now truly an old man
My parents could notice this and especially my father for unlike me they had known Max when he was young
In his old age Max drove even more slowly and not always in a straight line sometimes he would stop completely because he could not remember where he meant to be going
This was particularly worrisome when he set out for one of the neighboring towns in whose banks he kept money or for a meal or a haircut
These drives were through from Indianapolis to Denver and in those days before the interstate highway system it was heavily used by highspeed traffic
Max had become a peril on that road
The only problem with Max s driving I was aware of was one that developed when he bought a new car with an automatic transmission
In choosing the car he asked advice from my father
My father and the automobile dealer anticipated Max s difficulties in learning to operate a new car and they thought he would do best with one that did nt require shifting
Surely a sensible idea but they were wrong
Over fifty years of using a clutch had left Max unable to drive without one
By the time I became aware of the real problem I was living away from home
When I came back to visit my father often would arrange a drive for me with Max
And he told me that he hoped that Max would give up driving entirely
The idea was to show him that he and the hope was that Max would see this and renounce his own driving
Max would have to do it himself however for my father would not force him
At first I thought the solution was simple
It was obvious that Max must stop driving he threatened not only himself but other drivers and their passengers
My father had considerable influence with his father and it seemed to me that he must simply order Max to quit
It seemed so to me until my father told me when he first explicitly introduced me to the problem that he desperately wanted Max to quit and that he was suggesting it to him but that he could not force this on Max
I knew at once that my father was right and that he was wrong and I knew that I was seeing the complex depths of morality for the first time
I was and am infinitely relieved that it was my father and his father and not me and my father
When I was away news of Max s adventures
It came in letters and phone calls and it was a regular item like reports of the annual farm crop and the doings of my brother
The farm crops were cyclic and unchanging overall a dry growing season was followed by a moist one a poor crop by a good one
Those things balanced out
Max and my brother however were changing steadily in single directions
My brother was passing through his teens growing into the prosperity of adult youth
Max was declining and his driving grew ever worse
He had retired from the general store turning it over to my uncle and this left him with more time free for driving
Even if my father mother and brother could have been available to take him every time he wanted a drive he still sometimes wanted to drive himself
By now he had suffered a few scrapes and it seemed a miracle that there had still been no serious accident
My mother He could not force his father to give up the car
She could not force her husband to force his father
It was a moral impossibility
For both my parents it was the kind of gripping paralysis one feels while being swept into a disaster
The disaster would be Max s inevitable ruinous collision
I think my mother s apprehension was more acute because it was more complex
When the accident came she would suffer Max s hurt and whatever he brought to others and she would also share my father s inevitable remorse as he faced the fact that it was he alone who could have deterred Max and then she would have her own guilt for not having tried to persuade my father to persuade his father
My father remained unpersuaded he could nt stop Max he could nt take his car away
An entirely unexpected remission was granted in the s
The State of Illinois enacted a new code of driver regulations one of whose provisions was that any older driver must reapply to receive it
There was no chance that Max could pass this test
My whole family looked forward eagerly to the expiration of Max s license and the relief that was bound to follow
My town is in a county which has only one driver s license facility located in the town which is the county seat a little more than twenty miles away
When I was in high school all the teenagers hungered for their driver s licenses especially the boys even those who had already been driving in their work on the farms
The license was an absolute liberator
We needed cars to get anywhere to do anything
My high school was in another town three miles away so that too required driving
Everything we wanted to do had to be done after driving seeing movies going to ball games necking
And with the license one could finally do the driving oneself
In those days the minimum age for being licensed to drive in Illinois was unless one s birthday fell on Saturday or during the summer vacation one took the morning off from school went to the county courthouse to take the driving examination and came back to school before lunch time a legal driver
I was one of those who suffered the embarrassment of failing the test the first time
I can not remember what was wrong with my driving
There were a number of failures around that time and we all believed that the examiner was being harsh out of guilt because two boys he had licensed earlier in the year had subsequently driven into fatal accidents
I passed the test the second time and immediately dedicated myself to learning to drive fast on the farm country roads
A bit later I began to study my father s driving in order to learn to give the elegant swift comfortable ride he gave
I have been an excellent driver ever since although for many years now I have been mostly confined to bigcity driving where all one can do is play at lanechanging accelerations illustrate a worthwhile skill and where there is no chance for the expansive commanding generous driving I grew up with
I had already long been a crabbed city driver when the legal change came which would put a merciful impersonal end to Max s driving
The day of his test Max set out alone on the halfhour drive to the county seat
I do not know my father s feelings as he awaited Max s return
Would Max be dejected and need consolation How would my father give that Since his retirement Max had walked to the post office once each day he had walked to the card room and infrequently he took a stroll
And he had driven himself out of town when he wanted
Now he would be restricted to those few walks and even those were unavailable in bad weather unless someone were willing to drive him
Could he accept that I wonder if my father thought that Max could accept it and I wonder whether When Max had been gone for more than an hour a phone call came through to my father s office
It was the driver s license examiner
Max was fine the man told my father and he was on his way home
Driving
Of course he passed said the examiner
Do nt worry
Max will have a license as long as I m in charge of this office
""
My family was stunned but my father was relieved
If the law itself would not stop Max s driving then my father s inability to stop it was excusable
My father lives by a very strong moral code but it is a highly personal one and it sometimes accepts legality as the final word
A more cosmic code applied as well however for it was now clear that all those years more than fifty of being an honest and successful merchant of being the substance of the community of being Cohen of Cohen s to drive
This was clear to the driver s license examiner and then it became clear to Max s family
Max continued his driving
My family continued to drive him as much as possible and my father saw to the oil changes antifreeze adjustments lubrications and the rest which kept Max s car in good condition
After a very few more years Max took himself off the road giving up his car for good
There had been a few more minor mishaps but the feared catastrophe never came
Not long after that Max had to take himself from his house and enter a nursing home
Less than a year later he died
He was ninetythree or more
We have never known his exact age he came from the old country with imperfect records and eventually he himself did nt know his age
Max died about fifteen years ago
By then only my parents remained in our town
They still live there but they spend the cold about miles
They drive themselves both ways

By TED COHEN
A PROFESSION is among other things its conferences and yet what is any one person actually doing when attending At the last MLA in DC for example a woman asked me to shout Ca nt hear as a speaker began one of the sessions
I almost asked her to shout herself and I wanted to ask her if she did nt think she was committing a gender infraction in asking me
But I did nt
Should I have One simply attends a conference as we say
But what sort of behavior is authorized by such attendance Or is attendance merely an occasion for any sort of behavior pretty much as it is anywhere else in nonconferenced life At which session did I hear which speaker on what text that demonstrated the multiplicity of identityrelated acts
In the shuttle bus between the Sheraton and the Hilton I overheard a German woman with two interviews whose husband she said is Midwest liberal arts college Do you think they ll do to Deng Xiaoping what they did to but then I missed the name because somebody behind me proclaimed rather loudly that he was geographically mobile
The German woman seemed to be very nice to the Chinese man who in turn seemed to be trying very hard to give the impression that he was at ease with the energies of the conference
Is geographical mobility a better representation of these energies than ephemeral conversations between a German and a Chinese academic Or than my notation that such a conversation has something significant to do with the conference
Small World is the coyly ironic title of David Lodge s romance of transcontinental conferencing which concludes inevitably at the MLA
The text is so well known in the profession that Elaine Showalter during an initial session for grad students urged them to read it
She also cautioned that the Executive Director Phyllis Franklin was not authorized to marry people recalled mentioned in the piece on the conference that always appears in the local newspaper and advised no talk about anything except politics and the weather in the elevators
Showalter was nt worried about the best representation of the conference but she did reveal a witty consciousness about how it abides as a fondly represented not to say ceremonialized thing
She gave no clue to her listeners however about what any one of them might do with such a consciousness
Lodge writes that the megaconference that is the MLA is no kind of fun for candidates who want jobs or chairmen who have to interview them but for the rest of the members it s a ball especially if you like listening to lectures and panel discussions on every conceivable subject
But is it a ball even if you like to listen to what s spoken outside as well as inside the conference rooms And what about those who get to speak I especially recall another conference this past year in the profession
He glowed to his audience as he confidently rocked on his heels and tossed jaunty asides
We glowed back at him and chuckled
Certainly none of Lodge s principal characters attends the MLA for anything so frivolous as mere fun
Where they are not desperate for love they are desperate for recognition subjects which such an impeccably sophisticated occasion as the MLA has installed into official discourse if only as respectively sexism and politics but has not institutionalized
Can one now imagine a session Sex during the MLA It may be one of the curiosities of any conference that it aims potentially to institutionalize the totality of the experience that can be brought to it
Meanwhile one could ask what to do among the unincorporated or failed fragments the trivial incidents which nonetheless have some implication in what a paper will refer to as the torsional relation of the discourses or the stray vacancies that have not yet of its composition I do nt believe that there is a master narrative of the MLA
There is an official one distributed among the official sessions
What I want to propose here is the unofficial one of drifting in Roland Barthes s sense of the word or traveling in a somewhat more general economy
In DC I met a friend who was only interested in the one session on the one canonical writer who constitutes his field
That s all
He does nt drift
How many I wondered among DC s were so exclusively authenticated if not with one interest then with one luncheon date to keep one luminary to see at last or perhaps best of all one paper to read How to tell How to tell the narrative of the great many more as once again it seemed to me who sit edgily in chairs before sessions begin congregate nervously in halls or lobbies instinctively check the badge of anyone groan with the need for contact of some kind any kind This time I recalled at one point the DC convention where the most sheerly exuberant people I noticed all the cash bars having resembled as usual hastily concocted department meetings where nobody knows the chair were watching the Redskins playoff game in the Sheraton lobby
I had expired there in despair myself having realized too late that I had misread the program wherein the single session I had most wanted to attend was clearly given as taking place in the Hilton
The sheer size and variety of today s MLA present immense experiential problems to any single individual
Drifting is a solution
What if you do nt At one point I mused upon what might be included in someone s list of an ideal MLA delivering a wellreceived paper meeting an old friend from grad school hearing another paper which decisively confirmed the direction of one s own work having lunch with an eminent critic who allowed that one s own work ignoring the convention completely for both an afternoon and an evening buying all the most desirable books at the best publisher s booth for a full fifty percent discount and having sex preferably not encompassing both afternoon and evening with an assistant professor from a university one had never heard of who admitted afterwards being terribly impressed with one s own paper
How many are there however for whom such a story would not so much be too cynical as just too overdetermined It may well be that the majority of conventioneers aspire to nothing so grand so implicated in all the imperatives of the profession itself so formally convened
There is not a single moment of life from which one can not extract forces provided one knows how to differentiate it and combine it with others states Foucault
What s the trick What s the trick especially if you ve read Foucault who elsewhere provides a fair enough description of the MLA as both disciplinary formation so much in a person as in a certain concerted distribution of bodies surfaces lights gazes in any arrangement whose internal mechanisms produce the relation in which individuals are caught up Just so one attends any convention to be caught up it would seem
My own feeling however is that one attends simultaneously to extricate oneself or perhaps rather to see if and how one can do so
That is amid the disciplinary classifications and systematic distribution of themes institutional affiliations regulated times official sites ritualized exchanges and highly saturated contexts there is ceaselessly available the moment wherein one either enacts one s own subjective negotiation with something that is notMLA or else one does not do so because there is nothing that is not MLA
People attend the MLA for many reasons even if the MLA itself values only one or two of them
One reason some attend is to travel through all the reasons or anyway get caught up in as many any MLA it is possible to have another impossible fantasy not only to be able to attend every session but to be able to hear every conventionsaturated word
Since one ca nt what consolation I believe there is only one drifting
In The Pleasure of the Text Barthes makes drifting equivalent to the atopic the asocial as well as to the intractable the stupid and even the suicidal
Drifting is not based upon a principle of denial idealizing is
Hence the despair of ideals either unrealized or unrealizable
Drifting furthermore is based upon logical contradiction idealizing abhors such contradiction
Part of the monstrosity of the DC convention is the fact that it immediately defeats even the fantasized logic of total attendance which may be why there are now so many more smaller conventions where it is still possible to imagine oneself running in and out of all the rooms scheduled for every time period
It is the very rhythm of what is read and great narratives writes Barthes has anyone ever read Proust Balzac War and Peace word for word At the MLA vie can indeed meet such people or at least listen to papers given by ones who present themselves as such people
Over against each one I would set Barthes s scandalous antihero of a reader at the moment he takes his pleasure which partakes equally of what is not as well as what is the totality of what is officially given
But such a scandal seems to me to be very difficult to enact much less conceptualize
Drifting lies in the rhythm of what is attended and what is not attended
What might be most difficult is avoiding making such attendance into a project
Furthermore the pleasure of drifting ideally exists at all times as available
But again what is not programmed I remember a fatigued moment in the Sheraton lobby when I happened upon a sheet announcing a special issue of a magazine devoted to a Had I only found myself drifting into another version of attendance
One can I suppose ignore how utterly enmeshed one is at today s MLA and how fatefully subject to discipline
I ve mentioned my friend of the one session
People also come to an MLA to read their papers then leave
Have they in fact attended the convention at all its variously representative aims as well as the social participation upon which such aims are predicated or reinstituted attendance only in its negative form What about those who drop in to one or two sessions then retire to the homes of hospitable friends or local museums or hourslong drinks in the lobby with yearsunseen colleagues An MLA remains after all an Event but also an event that provides a pretext for any number of any one person s quite other events and yet drifting away is not the same thing as drifting especially if one enters the waters in order not to get wet
I ve also his son one evening of women s caucus entertainment in order he hoped to see lesbians dancing a student who attended an afternoon in New York for the sole purpose of seeing what William Empson looked like and a nowretired former colleague who told me that the best time he ever had at an MLA was one afternoon at a Palmer House bar drinking with a prostitute who insisted she could tell a convention of English professors from a convention of lawyers
One of the primary objects of discipline is to fix remarks Foucault in an aside
It is an antinomadic technique
But how can a discipline prevent nomads especially if it is not so easy to fix the boundary separating wanderingaway from wanderingthrough
What should an impeccably affixed MLA member be interested in Only certain things Just one thing Everything In his memoirs Anthony Powell recalls that Gilbert Murray was once asked if he was interested in incest
Only in a very general sort of way the In the first time slot of the convention just past was a session entitled The Muse of Masturbation
If one is nt interested in such a session how is one supposed to respond to it With outrage A bemused smile One could argue that either response is a legitimate if minor pleasure of attending the convention and furthermore that drifting into and then out of some sort of response as opposed to the room of the session is more or less the most compelling theoretical desideratum these days when only a very general sort of interest in just about anything has replaced some clear basis for excluding at least a few things
Of course subjects or authors are excluded
The interest that does obtain proceeds as always along the lines of scholarly specialization rather than impressionistic whim
Legitimating subjects continues to be what the MLA convention is in part all about
Yet when what is programmed is incessantly lambasting the familiar comfortable and canonized as globally diverse it is in a sense easier than ever before to drift
Similarly now that all is discourse what of it that is spoken inside the meeting rooms abides now as far less securely demarcated from what is spoken either before or after the session begins
Between sessions I chanced to hear one man who seemed to be speaking about his paper declare Sex in Chaucer is
""
""
I deliberately declined to hear the completion
I m not sure why
Because it struck me for a moment as more enjoyable to imagine myself how the statement could be completed Or because I had some instinctive sense that any completion would just be a displacement of a more fundamental presence and of course it is the displacement which is interesting not the presence there being no such undeconstructable thing It s very easy as I say to drift
Yet such an example illustrates just as much the problem of drifting because it is too officially enabled I think
happened to pass a woman who was saying to another I m not sure if I want to go to the Romantics cash bar
I smiled
At the image of Wordsworth welcoming guests while Dorothy poured the wine Maybe
Was the woman s perfectly sensible hesitation an example of what inside the meeting rooms would be termed a legitimating function of the convention itself Or perhaps my smile was a decontextualizing move even a registration or mark of spectatorial consciousness
When the more commonplace discourse outside the meeting rooms relaxes from the rigors of that inside them one only attends an MLA now I believe in order to discover that the outside is in fact unlocatable
The theoretical mandate for reinscription or recuperation is everywhere
One year I spoke briefly to a man who appeared to feel that the convention had been ruined for him because the subject of the president s address had not been published beforehand
What to reply That carelessly or that the president may have lately been reading deconstructionist critiques against TOOLONG Years ago I met another man whose sole reason for attending was to jockey for position at as many publisher s booths as he could in order to gain maximum advantage for the fifty percent buyoff on the last day
Again what to say Fetishizing texts is another thing the MLA is all about although lately a rather retrograde notion because there is plenty of sheer textuality incipient or otherwise elsewhere to consume
At DC there could be observed the fullest display of how great is the disciplinary investment in looking for gaps nodes and interstices for the interpretation of textual practice
The once almost terroristically theoretical terminology such as valorize or erasure has been completely domesticated and the psychologistic vocabulary of displacement or scene is thoroughly in place in order to elucidate embedded narratives or genderinflected interpretive strategies
No greater professional triumph can be secured at the MLA unsettled or undone
In one session a speaker veritably pounced upon the subversive rupture of the logic she had been tracing in the conflicting agendas of her author
This represented a very different sort of zeal from that rising off the pedestrian thematics of another session s paper whose author failed to restrain a knowing smile as he roundly declared the fearful truth in one s psychic imagination
""
But what sort of migratory triumph or just installation can be made Just enjoy the lush selfenclosed dance of critical idiom for its own sweet sake That is quite apart from its hermeneutic or discursive labor in any specific instance
At the last MLA in LA I heard a word that I ve never heard or read since deontified
It was recently in DC that I had a brief discussion over whether or not it is now more fashionable to say rupture rather than gap in one s discourse in looking for either one more or less vulnerable to what it ca nt recuperate or is unable to re inscribe One thing for certain this moment uses up so many apparently simpler or naive perspectives that the canniness of drifting consists in being willing to appear dumb or just plain stupid before an ultrafied logic whose consequence as somebody joked is that you ca nt write to your mother without putting brackets around the m
""
Does a system elicit an ultimately comic perspective from one who inhabits it by drifting I believe this is too programmatic
Just as no convention is in a constant relationship to its program no conferee is in a constant relation to the convention
The program indeed might be compared to a travel itinerary structured to bring the tourist to the Great Sites to which might be compared the Great Subjects or the Great Critics and yet permitting enough diversion or free time along the way so that one might engage in But who would be the natives at an M LA convention The hotel workers At another convention this past year I had a pleasant conversation with the man who wheeled away the movie projector from a sessionand soon revealed himself to be a professor in charge of media conventionwide
The experienced tourist knows that often the marginal experiences prove more memorable than the official ones which can be so crowded familiar or just inert that one may as well have stayed home
Sightseeing is a kind of collective striving for a transcendence of the modern totality writes Dean MacCannell in The Tourist a way of attempting to overcome the discontinuity of modernity of incorporating its fragments into unified experience
Not a bad definition of conventioneering even if the most decisive difference is that the convention program unlike the tour itinerary offers instead an immersion in discontinuity
But this does not prevent a member of the group from suddenly finding that the language of the rest is more exotic than that of whether the spectacle of over a hundred people crammed into a hotel room and hushed before the lone voice of a man or woman reading a paper was meant to be a spectacle much less whether one ought to find it moving or absurd
MacCannell again
An authentic touristic experience involves not merely connecting a marker to a sight but a participation in a collective ritual in connecting one s own marker to a sight already marked by others
Yet if something that is notMLA can always be converted into something that is there will always be at any MLA disconnected sights which will never be marked by others the convention is about recognition and its representation and every convention stages itself within the at once mobilized and dispersed tension between what is recognized and what is not
Drifting you not only disconnect yourself but fall into the seduction of a calculation whereby what no one else appears to mark becomes the only thing worth seeing
MLA members are to notice a woman nursing her baby in the front row of one session and no one gaped one evening at the Famous Critic eating scrambled eggs and pancakes in the company of two women who each looked as if she wanted to eat him
On one panel a real Harvard professor in a real bow tie
Did he or anyone else smile inwardly at the lineaments of caricature At another session one female panelist in a bright lavender jacket along a solid row of grey male tweed
How many in the audience wondered about sexual politics the semiotics of professional fashion or something else more gratuitous The stray moments when one s soberest attention fails the hopelessly fugitive moments when one is elsewhere such moments are private plural uncomprehensive perhaps uncomprehending and certainly unrepresentable
It is no different with the surface of words the most fashionable DC discourse was so complicit with one s own subversive desires for mere enjoyment that it can be all too inescapable to challenges the certainty of written knowledge or questioning whether a text is capable of sincere or even authentic textual selfrecovery
""
At an earlier MLA I once happened to be sitting among a group of men when one rose up and radiantly moved away to the sudden call for so it had been mysteriously given unto him of the rarest of boons an onthespot interview
It had been about an hour since he had delivered his paper
Exactly where was he ascending I recalled the cavernous interviewing room
How could such a thing really be possible I felt I was witness to a professional miracle
Yet recognition of course spreads
At the MLA one feels it as if it were a species of living stuff to be produced consumed and reproduced
Some gets represented used up represented again and some does not
According to what basis Jacques Derrida has an essay for a conference which is therefore to him the dominant generality of representation to be authority
What authority exactly dictates what representation is less Derrida s concern than the very category of representation itself which acts at least since Descartes to determine the apprehension of whatever it is that is of concern or interest in any relation at all
""
And at the MLA Is there finally anything more to say than that there remains like a kind of residue much of no concern or interest because there is so much of concern and interest all of it representable But what of that which is not Like my own bemused wonderment at the onthespot interview is what eludes meanders by or deviates from authoritative representation necessarily fated to be as we say unrepresentative Or does it have its own errant life after all in the representational machine which produces as in the case of the miraculously chosen interviewee I do nt know if he got the job a represented subject drifting arises from the fact that it fails consistently to perform the work of representing itself like a traveler subject to forgetting where he s going or where he s been
And if it would represent itself as I have been attempting to do Ultimately I believe by means of anecdotes
In Teletheory Greg Ulmer several times discusses the function of anecdotes as one form of speculative organization although his primary interest is in those embedded in the abyss of a theoretical discourse
What I want to claim myself is that anecdotes enunciate a knowledge more miniature diverse random and incidental than theory whose narrative is sponsored by some governing idea
The idea of an anecdote in contrast is far less explicable without the conclusive unity between story and explanation
Do anecdotes furthermore propose a self whose identity is akin to the ideally multiplied one of the traveler It would seem so
When traveling that is things just happen and if we want to add it all up we may not be entirely free of the feeling that it may not add up to anything at all
There are many stories which can be told not only as we say the representative ones
So I d like to conclude my account of drifting through the MLA with two anecdotes one about boundaries kept the other about boundaries crossed
At least I think the anecdotes are about boundaries
I m more certain they re about selfhood specifically the kind that conferences at once represent and fail to represent
Drift as you please at the MLA it s very difficult not to coalesce as yourself much as you trust you can either exceed or elude who you are in the interests of finer or shallower energies
Next to me when I boarded the plane to fly out to the LA convention was a severe owlish chap
Surely not an English professor I thought
But sure enough
produced a pen and peered at the first page
Excuse me I emboldened myself are you an English teacher He allowed as how he was
Going to the MLA Curt assent
Such was the full extent of our intercourse
I already had a copy of the New York Times Book Review in my hands and eventually somewhere during the time we bumped over the Rockies I produced my own novel
By then my fellow conferee was well into what was obviously his convention paper carefully laid out on top of his leather briefcase
He never looked up until we landed and the plane came to a full stop
I reflected that I could have been sitting across from the Reverend Mr Collins and I thought of the sweatshirt which declares that its wearer would rather be reading Jane Austen a motto to which would have to be added in his case for strictly professional reasons
""
And yet and may have taken me to be a version of him
My destinational query may have been too sprightly already to him a version of nonattendance just as his reply struck me as far too dry already a definitive confirmation of attendance
Enjoyment Quite possibly a grimmer term for him than me though not without its irony inseparable from mine
No matter what his behavior may have indicated had I been able to discuss with him what he took the significance of attending the MLA to be I want to doubt that his answer would have been fundamentally different from mine
In the words of Walter Stone in an older idiom than I ve been citing since they were published over thirty years ago
A man s profession is not a mere appendage to life and ought not to be
It ought to be just as full of meaning and have just as much connection with eternity as any of his other activities
The convention is the ritual of his the activities of his colleagues and his past in perspective with his present
It teaches him where he stands in the world of his peers and where he stands in the history of himself
For in that permanent world outside time and place he meets precisely himself
I could put our agreement this way although the convention toward which we headed was nothing if not saturated in more disciplinary relations than either of us would ever directly experience it remained a site in which we could confront our own identities nonetheless
And who did we find Ourselves consuming because others were producing or delegated while others went in their own name
It is impossible at the MLA not to meet oneself or not to repeat the structure whereby someone else reappears as oneself
Is it possible not to go in your own name A concluding story
My own main purpose in flying to LA was not to attend the MLA
That year I was not even a member
So when I decided being inconceivable since much of the representational foundation would then collapse and even drifting would become impossible since there would be no structure from which such an activity could veer I had to get a badge in order to fit in
One day I secured a badge for a single session
Another day a friend loaned me one for another session
After that session I chanced to find still another badge on a hotel corridor floor
With this last badge I felt I had an identity at last or rather I had a floating signifier that could enable the matter of my identity to be dispensed with
So it went
No one ever took me for the man whose name was on the badge
In DC three years later I met a colleague from my own university
He introduced me to the man with whom he had been chatting
This man looked at my badge I looked at his
On his read the very name of the badge I had found in too uncomfortably like meeting myself
Is it not a perfectly logical inversion of the structure whereby someone else reappears as oneself that oneself may reappear as someone else
Badges of course enable recognition to be conducted according to professional or institutional hierarchies
Badges required subjectivities to be represented officially
My meeting this man at once me and notme could only have been possible through the signifying system of badges and yet the significance of the meeting could neither be quite recognized nor represented by the system
I was nt sure if I had drifted into the system or out of it
Had I exceeded the convention framework or vanished beneath it
This past year again in DC I was especially struck by a statement from one session about the life of signs at the heart of social life
I recalled my above meeting five years ago
Again it seemed to me to have no professional use and I believe I relaxed into the memory more confidently without very much resistance
I much anyway
Its edges felt too rounded the days had been too strenuous I had felt too completely myself
The moment of the earlier DC meeting did nt make me feel fulfilled just perhaps better dispersed for drifting through the MLA is drifting in and out of signification and it remains possible to enjoy some crossings for what they get rid of as well as for what they affirm
By TERRY CAESAR
MANY HISTORIANS have argued that Santayana s The Life of Reason marked the inauguration of naturalism as a philosophical movement in the United States
Almost none however have noted that this book was acknowledged by even its sharpest contemporary critics for example Arthur Kenyon Rogers as the first comprehensive presentation of pragmatism in this country or anywhere else
In this set of books Santayana characterized knowledge as nonfoundational inquiry reason as nontranscendent or immanent criticism every sort of language as expressive imaginative or poetic every part of existence as contingent or historical and philosophy itself as a reflection on problems of human finitude rather than a search for first principles or for the really real
What is more Santayana never gave up any of these views even when his critics stopped calling his philosophy pragmatic and he himself had criticized the pragmatic school and distanced himself from it
So what did the pragmatic Santayana and the pragmatists disagree about and do these disagreements matter In is this Santayana s pragmatic naturalism was religious in ways that pragmatists like John Dewey Joseph Ratner and Sidney Hook could not abide while their pragmatic naturalism too often boiled down to strenuous moralism to suit Santayana
Caricature and overstatement lurk in the wings because the pragmatists especially Dewey paid a lot of attention to esthetic experience along with morality and society and even claimed that esthetic experience had a religious quality
But I still think in the end that the chief bone of contention between Santayana and other pragmatists lay in Santayana s attention to religious or spiritual life understood as something different from moral virtue and as something more fullblooded than some sensequalifying esthetic experience
There are six overlapping ways to think through this contention
First by and large the pragmatists especially after William James were preoccupied with social life
They acted as social critics or sometimes cultural critics
But one of the most remarkable characteristics of their cultural criticism lies in what it neglected there of solitude
For Santayana spiritual life was concerned both with life alone and with life together with the question of solitary equanimity and personal wellbeing in the face of mortality as well as with the issue of social solidarity
Santayana was criticized by pragmatists for his interest in human solitude
He was charged with being an oldfashioned individualist an escapist a romantic a mystic
For his part Santayana criticized the pragmatists for their inability to see that critical thought extended beyond the formulation of social policy to problems of personal wellbeing that no social policy or social relationship could solve
There were not only lots of lonesome valleys that people had to walk through but also solitary disciplines that brought individuals profound satisfaction as well
Second in the pragmatists view life was no laughing matter because it was beset by tragedy
Pragmatism as Hook put it was informed by a tragic sense of life by the recognition and analysis of conflicts between good and good good and overriding commitment to resolve these conflicts
Their social criticism waxed prophetic as it called readers to this duty chiding them for their failure to live up to the social promise embodied in the symbol of America its democratic institutions and its motto e pluribus unum
Santayana saw things somewhat differently noting that prophets are constitutionally incapable of a sense of humour and advising his readers that the young man who has not wept is a savage but the old man who has not laughed is a fool
Human life had its compensations
In his view people should turn to the task of resolving conflict as best they could
He said that tragedy was not to be denied or explained away as is sometimes attempted in cowardly or mincing philosophies
But he suggested there was no necessity demanding that people be consumed by it
People not too much starved or thwarted by circumstances and prepared to engage in spiritual disciplines could take joy just while Rome burned
Santayana replied that if human life was no laughing matter it was probably just deadly and not worth living
Third while the pragmatists undercut the Enlightenment s quest to find a way to ground knowledge in itself they endorsed an Enlightenment commitment to the project of human selfassertion
Here is Dewey
Faith in the power of intelligence to imagine future which is a projection of the desirable in the present and to invent the instrumentalities of its realization is our salvation
And it is a faith that must be nurtured and made articulate surely a sufficiently large task for our philosophy
Santayana to the contrary pictured human selfassertion as both indispensable and as inevitably falling short of its aims salvation as coming with the love of life in the consciousness of impotence and philosophy as providing disciplines for such affection
Fourth and following the pragmatists tended to construe philosophy as socially and politically engaged a kind of inquiry that prepared citizens or their as a middleclass profession offering politicians technocrats and other professionals synoptic blueprints on which to base their social planning
Santayana especially after writing the Life of Reason inclined toward picturing philosophy as a suspension of such business an interruption of normal social action a disengagement from policy and politics a disintoxication from the particular values that happened to shape up this or that society or polity a holiday from statesmanship
Philosophy he suggested let people enjoy time out for intellectual festivity celebration worship religious meditation as well as cognitive or imaginative free play
The pragmatists took this characterization of philosophy as unprofessional irresponsible and sanctimonious a residue from an Old World theological distinction between this and otherworldly concerns
Santayana on the other hand scolded pragmatists for their shortsightedness for their fixation on what he called the political and economic foreground
He asked what good political and economic systems could serve if they did not afford opportunities for extrapolitical found little good to say about distinctively religious narratives practices or institutions which they pictured as draining energies away from the problems of men while fueling superstition and fanaticism
They followed Dewey s lead by distinguishing between religion and the religious
Religion Dewey said amounted to fixed and differentiated creeds and cults that were indelibly supernatural in content and socially exclusive to boot
The religious on the other hand was an esthetic quality of any activity pursued in behalf of an ideal end so inclusive that it unifies the self against obstacles and in spite of threats of personal loss because of conviction of its general and enduring value
Suspicious of differentiating religions from other parts of culture Dewey tried to displace them by underscoring the religious quality of esthetic experience
He said it was in the creation and enjoyment of works of art for example that
we are as it were introduced into a world beyond this world which is nevertheless the deeper ordinary experience
we are carried out beyond ourselves to find ourselves
I can see no psychological ground for such properties of an experience save that somehow the work of art operates to deepen and to raise to great clarity that sense of an enveloping undefined whole that accompanies every normal experience
This whole is then felt as an expansion of ourselves Where egotism is not made the measure of reality and value we are citizens of this vast world beyond ourselves and any intense realization of its presence with and in us brings a peculiarly satisfying sense of unity in itself and ourselves
From Santayana s vantage point this talk of getting beyond ourselves to find ourselves by way of a sense of an enveloping undefined whole amounted to the last thin gasp of Hegelian idealism truncating religious traditions to a point that was laughable
He attempted rather to make cultural space for religion and ridiculed the idea of some generically religious quality that could inform any activity
He argued that the more hopeless than the attempt to have a religion that shall be no religion in particular
And he prized particular religions for providing another world to live in
""
In his view otherworldliness did indeed have a function but it was strictly cultural not transcendent or postmortem
In religious institutions people practiced disciplines that let them suspend the order of their normal social world particularly the differentiations and hierarchies of social economic and political life
There people practiced religious virtues like piety or devotion to the sources of their lives spirituality or devotion to their ultimate concerns and charity or appreciation of what was good for others as they understood themselves
Religions gave people these disciplines both to let them imagine things that bonded human beings together no matter what their social political or economic roles or circumstances happened to be and to devise practices that facilitated personal equanimity
Santayana argued that these disciplines the religious narratives in which they were presented in exemplary ways narratives were not inevitably to blame for superstition and fanaticism
Rather supernaturalism or the confusion of ideals and powers was accountable for these things
But the narratives and disciplines that constituted religious traditions could be reconstructed or explicated in naturalistic ways without destroying either their particularity or the differences they made for people s lives
Finally pragmatists pictured democracy Americanstyle as the divine way of doing things
They urged people to pour all the fervor and enthusiasm they may once have had for religious traditions into a devotion to political and social democracy
Santayana demurred unwilling to call any one form of political life divine and willing to note all the ways in which modern democracies whether socialist or consumer capitalist had ended up pitting equity and equities homogeneity and mass life against excellence
A good government government for the people he claimed turns the forces of nature as far as possible from enemies into servants and the pressure of society into latent powers
Universal suffrage was one but by no stretch of the imagination the sole means to that end
In principle if not in fact Santayana argued timocracy was probably a better arrangement demanding equal opportunity but permitting unequal achievement along with government by people who merited their assigned offices by the breadth and depth of their accomplishments in economic and political arts
Now these six conflicts that I have rehearsed are not news from nowhere
They have a history textually inspired most immediately by themes in Emerson
These were not conflicts between Emerson and his critics but rather between Emerson and himself
Society and solitude the tragic and the comic impotence and assertion or fate and freedom prophetic reform and spiritual contemplation the grace of communion and the cant of religion American democracy as divine life lived at first hand and as the land of the dead alive condemned to life at second hand all these conflicts are Emersonian
But they themselves are grounded in s Protestant forbearers whether republican or theocratic
The tensions I am thinking about descend from Reformed Christian preoccupations with grace and law with the view that moral practices while indispensable do not circumscribe personal life in its most divine moments that personal equanimity in some sense requires letting go of moral propriety that it calls for some sort of solitary new birth or recreation that reveals simultaneously the limitations and genuine advantages of the social conventions we inherit on the one hand and the lovely are lovable character of mortal life on the other that doing well neither causes nor secures being well that personal wellbeing can occur but that it can not be achieved because its happening is gratuitous
These views drawn with great precision by traditional Reformed Christian thinkers like Jonathan Edwards outlasted their original supernatural and Christological context
They remained central when Edwards himself dropped supernatural and Christian language for esthetic discourse in his battles with British Benevolists over the nature of true virtue
They postChristian Protestant efforts as William Clebsch put it to respiritualize a natural outlook that had become despirited
They remained at the heart of William James s quest to satisfy what he called the religious demand by searching for supernatural powers at work in the world
More to the point they shaped Santayana s utterly naturalistic understanding of the stresses and strains between moral and spiritual practices
For that matter they also haunted Dewey s equally naturalistic vision of the ways in which esthetic experience outstrips as he put it moral consecrations of the status quo
""
But now I want to ask who cares about these tensions anymore Or to put it more personally and assertively why do I care about the prospects for a religious naturalism like Santayana s and is my concern simply selfindulgent and atavistic I care because I share these views with Santayana if we are concerned with the problems and promise of human finitude we had best attend to society and solitude because things that impede it without coming to grips with both
If by the promise of human finitude we mean the realization of such joy we had better make room for comedy as well as tragedy in our sense of life because it is comedy not tragedy that takes joy as seriously as it does meanness
The comic sense requires us to accept finitude and ultimate impotence along with our commitment to disclosing the pretensions of selfassertion
Along with a devotion to human solidarity and often in its service philosophers in the West have traditionally broken away from recommending social policy to meditate on such conditions and our culture would be better off if they continued to do this
Stripped of false explanatory accounts that turn ideals into powers accounts that let people pretend that the universe works for truth and right forever or that empower us whoever we are so that we can dominate them whoever they are traditional religious institutions narratives and cultural functions
Democracy Americanstyle is not the divine way of doing things and the spiritual exceptionalism that suggests that it is by collapsing eschatology and nationalism into one another has fostered more than a modicum of cruelty
American democracy is a handy way in my view if not Santayana s probably the handiest to structure life politically
But this is so in great part because democracy has secured a culture that is eclectic thriving on a diversity of moral and religious traditions a culture endangered by homogeneity whether unbearably light or weighty
Indeed democracy s worth as a political system is to be measured not simply by its commitment to selfdetermination or by its economic facility but also and more by its ability to sustain this diversity of traditions that discipline imaginations in ways that give point to human life
To my mind these six areas of inquiry constitute a program of study for religious naturalists to pursue
So let me tip my own hand all too briefly me are committed to human solidarity
But we know that there are lines some fine some coarse separating concord cooperation and fellowship from the sort of mass or bulk or uniformed life where as Milan Kundera has put it unity of mankind means No escape for anyone anywhere
We accept harmony as a superordinate goal to keep in mind when shaping up social attitudes but we reject oneness unanimity and the deterioration of private life
Why is this so Why do the stories of say Kafka and Kundera that explore the violation of solitude strike home to us with such force Is it because we are socially dysfunctional or politically naive misanthropes incurable romantics or mystic dilettantes No
It is because we think that human wellbeing or joy depends as much on what goes on in people when they are by themselves as on what happens in their interactions with other people as much on private transformations and associations as on social justice because more than anything else what is at stake is the imaginative life
It is important however not to read old epistemological or metaphysical presumptions into this phrase
As I turn it at least there is nothing epistemologically private or asocial about imaginative life nothing metaphysical about it
I am for example writing this piece not only for myself but for anyone willing to see or hear it and my capacity to do so is the outcome of a lot of socialization and training
My effort like all effort is experienced and observable as plainly physical
But I have also turned aside from normal social activities asked people not to disturb me so that I might work out this way of thinking work on myself play with variations on old themes concerning human joy and the things impeding it
In so doing I am as James would say experiencing the practice of imagination as solitary
Cultural arrangements and disciplines make this possible disciplines propose new ones and my performance plays a cultural role
Moreover I am given leave to do so by way of political and economic legitimation
But it is the performance my solitary attention to an interest my practical competence not social relationships or policy per se that is at risk and is the site of whatever agony and joy or sense of beauty goes on
The performance may or may not be good for anything else in particular
It may or may not contribute to human solidarity
Nonetheless it may bring me or somebody else some sense of wellbeing
There is something right then about Richard Rorty s suggestion that the old tension between the private and the public remains there are no necessary connections between private hopes and social justice but only contingent practical ones and thus it is right to abandon a quest for some theory revealing an essential human core safe beyond time and change linking up such things
decomposed or recomposed
The realization of welloiled democratic practices and institutions predictably will leave individuals still yearning for solitude and having to manage the personal difficulties accompanying loss and change suffering absurdity evil and death
There is no escaping these things and so pragmatic naturalists would do well as Cornel West suggests to retain a sense of the tragic that highlights the irreducible predicament of unique individuals who undergo dread despair disillusionment disease and death and the institutional forms of oppression that dehumanize people
But the problem still remains how to display the meanness of suffering and then transcend it by celebrating passing joys and victories in the world which is a problem that comic vision seeks to resolve
When essentialism still saturated thinking in the West critics explicated comic episodes as events in which conventional social distinctions or pretensions separating people from one another got undercut disclosing a core of humanity or community in which everybody could take some joy kings and paupers exchange clothes the subversions of jokes where say the welldressed lady slips on a banana peel and the reversions from selfconscious and constrained adulthood to playful or spontaneous childhood that are prominent in texts like Alice in Wonderland let us abandon imaginatively at any rate conventional social differences for participation in delightfully real human unions or communions that are acultural and ahistorical in nature
For pragmatists this explication of comedy can not work because nature is historical and human history is cultural and because as Santayana put it in this world we must either institute conventional forms of expression or else pretend that we have nothing to express
The choice lies between en a mask and a figleaf and the figleaf is only a more ignominious mask
But comedy surely survives essentialism
Abandoning such language does not disrupt our capacity to explore things that let us laugh both at the absurdity of our own pretensions and at the fortuitous bonds that are forged with others who are really personalities
Embracing pragmatic naturalism does not spoil happy endings
Comedy is contingent on incongruity and affinity not appearance and reality
But both incongruity and affinity depend on the occurrence of variation change continuity and coherence all of which characterize finite beings living in a world that is historical all the way along
Thank goodness that after years of nearly unexceptional blindness to comedy pragmatists like Giles Gunn and Cornel West are once again exploring its critical and imaginative functions
Gunn building on the works of Kenneth Burke and Mikhail Bakhtin reaches for a cultural criticism that reflects bonds strong enough to include in Burke s words our own fundamental kinship with the enemy
This sort of criticism Gunn argues
requires the development of a critical language that not only challenges the privileging of its own terms but also seeks to undermine such symbolic activity everywhere by revealing the strategies in which we are all implicated
For this purpose only a comic language will do one that or at least unexpected and unlikely linkings and comparisons
West is developing a prophetic pragmatism out of the fundamentally tragic idioms found in such precursors as Hook Lionel Trilling Reinhold Niebur and Raymond Williams
But speaking as an AfroAmerican Christian he has begun to celebrate the radically comic character of AfroAmerican life the pervasive sense of play laughter and ingenious humor of blacks which on his reading emerges out of the Gospel as blacks read and act themselves into it
That sense of play laughter and ingenious humor I suggest is misread if it is construed exclusively as an expression of power which is how West reads it
To be sure humor can imaginatively disarm the dominant and empower the oppressed
But radical comedy is not simply a contest of wills
Rather it involves an admission that in no small part what links us up is the powerlessness and mortality that we all share it is an acceptance occurs as Santayana put it when everybody acknowledges himself beaten and deceived yet is the happier for the unexpected posture of affairs
It is a performance he suggested that leads to forgiveness acceptance and understanding showing us the innocence of the things we hated and the clearness of the things we frowned on or denied
""
But if this sort of radical comedy cuts ice then Rorty s recent emphasis on private selfassertion truncates extrapolitical life
On Rorty s counsel the old Christian idea of Law gets naturalized when responsibility to God becomes responsibility to one another
Democracy as he puts it after Nietzsche but without his sneer is Christianity made natural
Similarly though Rorty does nt say this the old Christian idea of Grace gets romanticized when new personal creation through divine encounter becomes selfcreation through strong poetry
Emerson s life at second hand becomes Harold Bloom s horror of finding himself to be only a copy or a replica some difference that makes his I different from all the other I s
""
This certainly is one way to naturalize the life of the spirit
But Rorty dismisses the Western tradition that pictures tension between selfassertion and spirituality the tradition of selfsurrender still prominent in James s religious demand for a sort of wellbeing that welldoing obstructed in Santayana s advice that spirituality is constituted by the willingness not to will that is ingredient in radical comedy and more recently in Richard Poirier s reflections on writing off the self
This is so because in Rorty s view agonistic selfassertion is the only route to personal wellbeing worth recommending in a world without any supernatural powers in it
He argues that the tradition of selfsurrender requires a metaphysics of transcendence unavailable to naturalists
Moreover he can not imagine a creative individual finding selfassertion hardly satisfying
But this tells us more about the limits of Rorty s imagination and temperament than it does about the varieties of seemed woven into the need to worship a deity that escaped natural constraints something new can be made of it that permits equanimity in light of natural contingencies rather than despite them
We do nt require any essential or transcendent otherness to appreciate the wonder and beauty of other things and people or to find wellbeing not in an I different from all the other I s that seems sure to be defeated but instead where our personal dissolution is accepted
Rather we require a particular temperament
We may require a temperament as Poirier puts it in favor of relaxation rather than selfassertion of drift rather than aggressive deployments of contemplative receptivity rather than active projection
But it is not clear to me why we need to exhibit one temper rather than the other
They are contrary not contradictory
Ca nt both be present sometimes even together Are nt the tensions between assertion and reception action and contemplation judgment and understanding better the other
To my mind they are
It seems to me however that most pragmatic naturalists still suspect that diversion meditation and discernment are decadent in a world sufficiently wretched to demand constant contention movement and decision
They write to mandate action and they picture contemplation and understanding as gestures that delay
But delayed reaction is the better part of wisdom when people rush to Judgment or even worse when trained functionaries react according to convention without understanding the role they are playing
Then there is no difference that makes a difference as Hans Blumenberg has put it between delayed reaction and conscious action
""
Kundera has written that the modern era dawned twice over once with Descartes who launched the quest for certain truth and again with Cervantes who introduced the art of the novel an art that presumed the loss of such certainty
The novel became the territory where no one possesses the truth
""
""
but where everyone s wisdom he says
is different from that of philosophy
The novel is born not of the theoretical spirit but of the spirit of humor It does not serve ideological certitudes it contradicts them
Like Penelope it undoes each night the tapestry that the theologians philosophers and learned men have woven the day before
Interestingly enough this characterization comes very close to the line that Santayana drew between moralistic life based on ideological certitude and spiritual life where people learned to suspend judgment and identify themselves not with themselves in order to understand and appreciate others who were different
For Santayana spirituality was a second insight
""
""
detaching us from each thing with humility and humour and attaching us to all things with justice charity and joy
""
The risk moralism runs is fanaticism the peril in spirituality is quietism
Santayana knew this
That is why meditating on the idea of Christ in the Gospels he commended and spiritual openness judgment and understanding assertion and reception assurance and doubt attachment and detachment
Suppose some of us pragmatic naturalists aim to embrace disciplines and attitudes like these
Is this reason enough to engage in traditional religious practices and to meditate on canonical religious books Surely as Jeffrey Stout has recently argued to great effect these practices do nt depend upon avowing any traditional theological view
We need not as he puts it postulate divine purposes let alone divine intentions in order to engage in wonder awe and even gratitude a kind of piety in short for the powers that bear down upon us for the majestic setting of our planet and its cosmos and for the often marvelous company we keep here
We can Stout notes keep our confidence loyalty hope and love proportioned to their objects and never make the merely finite our ultimate concern without invoking some Ultimate Other who deserves our this
But the religious virtuespiety confidence loyalty hope and love that Stout avows have a history
They have been articulated by particular religious traditions taught and learned in particular religious communities exemplified in the books that give shape to them and sustained as disciplines by particular religious institutions
If we walls to maintain the practice of particular virtues we need to maintain traditions communities books and institutions that shape lives that way
At least it is not clear what other alternatives we have
Does it matter that the central narratives that render these particular religious virtues intelligible and practically formative are legends as religious naturalists suggest rather than revelations of the really real Yes
It matters because it shows the profound role transparent fictions play for us whether for good or ill by giving us codes or ciphers that must be learned in order to practice distinctive ways of life
Can the practices we learn say as Christians Jews We ll have to see but of course we ll fail if we do nt try
We know that we need not take the stuffing out of tradition by doing so
We have seen the successes for example of Reconstructionist Judaism thick with liturgy rituals that emphasize the willingness not to wild training in moral virtues and Torah and Talmud study
We have seen practitioners in this movement not only keep commandments but experience the wonder and joy of selfsurrender
Pragmatic naturalists like me no longer have any interest in questions like what is the meaning of the whole of history or what happened before anything else happened or what will happen after everything else has happened or how do we make direct contact with the really real We do not confuse ideals with powers
So the shape of our traditions changes
But we can still learn practice and give witness to them in ways that maintain continuity and coherence with may remain culturally thick though varied without any semblance of supernaturalism
One of the things pragmatic naturalists can not reasonably claim to be sure is any incontrovertible warrant for their own beliefs or practices
But if their understanding of belief is adequate nobody can
This frightens some people who look for One Right Way to glue everything and everybody together and who are repelled by cultural plurality and eclecticism
People like this hold on as Kundera has put it to the Western dream of paradisethe ageold dream of a world where everybody would live in harmony united by a single common faith and will without secrets from one another
But others have recognized for centuries that this dream has wreaked a lot of havoc
The historical record seems fairly clear
As Kundera notes Once the dream of paradise starts to turn into reality here and there people begin to crop up who stand in its way and so the rulers of paradise must build a little of time this gulag grows ever bigger and more perfect while the adjoining paradise gets ever smaller and poorer
""
To my mind Stout is right to argue that the liberal tradition and modern democratic institutions emerged in great part in order to circumvent this scenario or as he puts it because people recognized putting an end to religious warfare and intolerance was morally good was rationally preferable to continued attempts at imposing a nearly complete vision of the good by force
He is right to suggest that this is why we school our children not to press too hard or too far for agreement on all details in a given vision of the good
""
People who fault liberal democracies for permitting plural intellectual religious and moral traditions claim that this drains us of concerted moral purpose and spiritual vitality they say that something close to complete agreement about moral or religious truth is just the elixir we need to cure the social diseases that ail us
That s silly
earth and its atmosphere gutting education colonizing the urban poor permitting rampant illiteracy or letting the marketplace ration health care
These problems stem from amorality and immorality not plural traditionsfrom stuff like greed thoughtlessness and apathy
We simply do nt have to agree on grand designs to consent to functionally adequate moral details we do nt even need to agree to every detail to be genuine friends and compatriots
Indeed our very eclecticism is a marvelous check on the pretensions of grand designs which brings me to my final reflection
Listen to William of Baskerville the learned Franciscan hero of Umberto Eco s The Name of the Rose

and those prepared to die for the truth for as a rule they make many others die with them often before them at times instead of them Perhaps the mission of those who love mankind is to make people laugh at the truth to make the truth laugh because the only truth lies in learning
It is a good thing the Abramic traditions have their Baskervilles Heschels and Sanais because they also have their Guis Kahanes and Khomeinis
If the first three made the truth of their traditions laugh bringing joy to the world the latter made it insane prepared to make others die
All too often election theologies in the West have spelled privilege rather than responsibility and have meant joy for us and terror for them
The good news is that being human we can always make something new out of something old
Our traditions have had their dark sides
But they have also done a great deal to shape our lives at their best
We see ourselves as part of their stories which have left us with unforgettable visions of good and evil and have instructed us in how to make life a little more divine
Whether we admit it or not we are always reweaving these stories
Let s try to do so in ways that make the truth
By HENRY SAMUEL LEVINSON
THAT THERE IS always another person in The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas may simply be a way of saying that this is a work that functions as the autobiography of two distinct individuals
The marvelous thing then is the way the book suggests these two Stein and Toklas living together it is the story of a life shared of converging complementary lives
But it is also a book that can be counted on to produce another person a person whom the reader is likely already to have heard of whose name therefore represents something in its own right on almost every page
Another person for example who turned up during that week was Bertrand Russell
These cameo appearances supplementary lives serve to refine occasionally even to redefine one s sense of the two autobiographers especially of Stein the one writing
This is why there is always another person like Russell turning up to turn the heat up again
""
Gertrude Stein to divert everybody s mind from the burning question of war or peace introduced the subject of education
This caught Russell and he explained all the weaknesses of the American system of education particularly their neglect of the study of reek
Gertrude Stein replied that of course England which was an island needed Greece which was or might have been an island
At any rate reek was essentially an island culture while America needed essentially the culture of a continent which was of necessity latin She grew very eloquent on the disembodied abstract quality of the american character and cited examples mingling automobiles with Emerson and all proving that they did not need greek
No they did not need Greek these eloquent Americans
They might choose to learn it as Emerson did then again they might not
Thus Donald Sutherland the author of an important biography of Stein s writing taught classics at the University of Colorado for many years yet in order to pass an entrance exam herself knew no Greek
Not only was such neglect entirely benign she insisted but it even pointed to a peculiarly American strength which had its source in what she called in the passage above the disembodied abstract quality of the american character
But the language here is so disembodied and abstract itself that something more is obviously needed to flesh it out
The disembodied abstract nature of Russell s work on the foundations of mathematics for instance can not be what Stein had in mind
Take away the Greek and with it the island mentality and it develops that a disembodied abstract quality means something very different for the American character and for Stein than it would when applied to Englishmen even those as uncharacteristic as Russell
In a series of lectures she gave at the University of Chicago in Stein asserted that the English in the nineteenth century were characterized by the fact that they lived this nothing more startling than that they were set in their ways they had generally arranged things so that life was predictable and conformed to established patterns
Yet not only were they settled their language was settled and it was with this language that Americans like Emerson had to express an entirely different reality one in which the norm was not a settled but an unsettled life
Consequently words which Stein regarded not merely as tools crafted by humans but as potentially persons conscious actors in their own right began to have within themselves the consciousness of completely moving
In contrast to the British Americans and their words were relatively easily abstracted from their circumstances and might wander off in any direction whether on the page or around the country
Automobiles as one of Stein s examples of a native strain of abstraction certainly facilitated this movement and what she called their serial production offered an entirely American model of the process
l leery Ford s perfection of the capitalism successfully completed the abstraction of the finished product from the individual assembly worker with the corresponding alienation of the worker from the product
The worker no less than the Model T was interchangeable and Stein would insist that this form of abstraction was even more fundamentally American than it was capitalist
It could already be found in the work of the prophet of Concord a half century before industrial capitalism had moved its center of operations from England to a relatively democratic America
Although Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper both crop up in her meditations on writing Stein tended to set Emerson at the head of her personal canon as she did in her lectures at Chicago
Those same words that in the English were completely quiet or very slowly moving began to have within themselves the consciousness of completely moving they began to detach themselves from the solidity of anything they began to excitedly feel themselves as if they were anywhere or anything think about American writing from Emerson Hawthorne Wilder and Dashiell Hammitt sic and you will see what I mean
As the words were detached from the solidity of things and from the British environment in which they had acquired their significance they inevitably became disembodied and abstract
Moreover such abstraction or detachment clearly went hand in hand with an Emersonian individualism that proclaimed the individual s freedom to be anywhere and to do anything
The cost of this detachment was on the one hand Emerson s apparent coldness what Stein elsewhere called the New England tradition with its aridity and its sterility but also with its individuality and on the other hand the loss of the traditional crafts with the opportunity they provided of performing a determinate even personalized function in the workplace although usually anonymously
The American tradition is most decidedly not an anonymous one and we probably have Emerson to thank for that
Yet aside from her sometimes extravagantly high selfregard Stein would appear to have little in common with him of form may well be the most radical that America has produced whereas his much more regular generically was limited to gnomic verse lectures and a voluminous journal
But they both wrote for the lustres and were equally unwilling to impose conventional order on what they had written
If American writing is generally less tidy than its British counterpart Emerson s and Stein s was particularly so
Still we do not find Stein drawing such comparisons between herself and Emerson
The only one of her predecessors she seems to have acknowledged with more than a passing reference was Henry James whom according to Alice Toklas she liked to call the precursor
But even about him she was less than candid
It has often been observed for instance that despite her assertion in The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas that she had not read James during her formative period Stein can already be found quoting his novel The Wings of the Dove published in which dates from 
Stein s denial of James s influence is even more duplicitous however than it first appears
She contends the passage in the Autobiography begins
that Henry James was the first person in literature to find the way to the literary methods of the twentieth century
But oddly enough in all of her formative period she did not read him and was not interested in him
But as she often says one is always naturally antagonistic to one s parents and sympathetic to one s grandparents
The parents are too close they hamper you one must be alone
So perhaps that is the reason why only very lately Gertrude stein reads Henry James
Yet it was Emerson and not James who in fact was the first person in literature to find the way to the literary methods of the twentieth century and Stein did herself something of a disservice by so stressing the uniqueness of her own writing that she has been all too often taken being as she also insisted and as she genuinely was a central figure in the main Emersonian line of American writing
But of course it was Emerson himself who argued for the importance of keeping up at least the appearance of selfreliance if for no other reason than that it was the only way one was likely to get anything of lasting interest done
When Stein chose to discuss James s literary method as in her lecture What Is English Literature she described it not as some radical break with the past but instead as typically American what American literature had always done
By this she meant that he wrote essentially after the manner of Emerson
His James s whole paragraph was detached what it said from what it did what it was from what it held and over it all something floated not floated away but just floated floated up there And so this makes it that Henry James just went on doing what American literature had always done English one but the disembodied way of disconnecting something from anything and anything from something was the American one
The way it had of often all never having any daily living was an American one
Some say that it is repression but no it is not repression it is a lack of connection of there being no connection with living and daily living because there is none that makes American writing what it always has been and what it will continue to become
Although it can be said of James that he wrote in discrete paragraphs this description is much more germane to Emerson s method of composition which was generally to select paragraphs from his journals and then forcibly to combine them
In this way the paragraphs dictated the rhythm so often discontinuous of his essays
Whatever James s paragraphs are they are not about the daily lives of his perfectly extraordinary Americans they are detached as Stein said from everyday life
What they may say with what he was doing in writing such elaborate prose
Stein s point is the fairly obvious one that Jamess style was greatly in excess of what was needed to describe life naturalistically but she carried the point two steps further
First she stressed that James like all the writers in Emerson s tradition was never particularly interested in representing any kind of settled daily life per se
He would introduce foreign elements that disturbed the hardwon equilibrium in the same way his own writing and that of the other Americans revised the British equivalent
Second like all these writers what kept him writing and what his writing was meant to suggest if not describe was a higher reality that transcendentally floated above the individual paragraphs
Between this transcendental function and anything one might be able to gloss about daily existence there was simply no connection
I know that the world I converse with in the city and in the farms Emerson wrote in the essay world I think
I observe that difference and shall observe it
One day I shall know the value and law of this discrepance
The tone here as most often in Emerson is that of someone who although a participant retains his wits about him remaining dispassionate even objective
As with Stein not only did this discrepancy and detachment underwrite both the work and the life it was the sole guarantee of any continuity between the two
The connection then was the lack of connection and American writing from Emerson to Stein if not written in the image of American life still conveyed its negative image not however as the representation of a repressed other but as the thoughts of a disconnected liberated self
As a Harvard and Johns Hopkinseducated American of the last quarter of the nineteenth century Stein would have encountered Emerson s ideas everywhere more unexpectedly we now encounter her everywhere in his work
Reality Subjectiveness he wrote and he might have been describing Stein s own writing
these are threads on the loom of time these are the lords of life
I dare not assume to give their order but I name them as I find them in my way
I know better than to claim any completeness for my picture
i am a fragment and this is a fragment of me
When Emerson says that he listed his lords of life as he did because it was the order he found them in his way he is being literally accurate and having a joke at his own expense
The lines open the magnificent concluding section of Experience and he had discussed the seven ideas in exactly this order in the preceding pages
All the same these lords of limit as Auden called them organized Stein s thought and writing even more thoroughly than they did Emerson s
Whereas he retained which he could never keep up she learned to do without it and to rely entirely on the kind of subjectivism he expressed when he observed in the same essay that thus inevitably does the universe wear our color and every object fall successively into the subject itself
They both conceived of their first writing as largely scientific in nature with Emerson trying to pass himself off as a naturalist and Stein perhaps more judiciously presenting herself as a psychologist
She rid herself more easily of the objective standards of a nonhuman universe and an impersonal language because the object of her study was always exclusively the human subject
Stein and Emerson both found the rhetoric of science amenable to the transformations they imposed on it Stein initially with her immense lists of what she called people s bottom natures which turned on the minute differences that could be discerned in basically repetitive behavior and Emerson in the reports he issued of his observations of nature and man
Although he human experience Emerson often did sound as if he were making absolute claims
The rhetorical nature of these was foregrounded however in the breaks in argumentation for which his essays many presented initially as public lectures have become renowned
The claims were made with some effect not some absolute truth in mind
An undercurrent of pathos is produced by a recurring conflict in Emerson s writing
There is on the one hand his strong desire for a knowledge of what William James was to call after him the stream of consciousness along with the desire to redirect the flow and bring the dead back to life
But against this he possessed an equally strong disillusionment and sense of personal powerlessness
Stein experienced both the desire and the disillusionment in the early period of her writing which included Melanctha and The Making of Americans but in the decades that followed when she produced her most original work from the Tender Buttons through the 
While she continued to write by the rules he had formulated for himself she made even the discontinuous style of his essays look conventional
At the same time she embraced his muchmaligned optimism with its disburdenment of constraints and general abandon more fully than he had ever been able to
His pessimism which even he sometimes overlooked had severely limited the range of his style
It assured that in the writing after Nature his conscience always near to hand took the form either of his fearing that he might have been abandoned by something Cod perhaps which ought to have loved him or alternatively that he might abandon might already have abandoned something or someone he ought always to love and cherish his dead son wife brother his possibly dead language
From Emerson s observation that our life seems not present so much as prospective it quite naturally followed that any formulation was sufficient for the moment only insofar as it would continuous present that Stein aimed at in her writing was only a more generous interpretation of the same recognition
Their writing styles could be unashamedly although unequally fragmented because they both held abandonment what Emerson in other moods would also call transition discontinuity detachment to be the law of writing as much as it was the unwritten law of life
It was the negative ground for the seven disembodied lords or lords of disembodiment in whatever guise they appeared
That Emerson tended to say the same thing over and over only rewritten for different occasions was not a failure on his part to think of something new to say or a clever way of dressing up and merchandising the few things he did have to say it was the invention of what at least in America was a new rhetoric
It was the kind of abuse of language that becomes necessary when people are obliged in order to distance themselves from communities they use the same language as their oppressors
What made this rhetoric so new and powerful in Emerson s hands was that he directed it against a literary tradition that however much it was his own was even more so another nation s a nation America had famously declared its independence from
As Stein would insist a century later in Wars I Have Seen the English language had presented America with a peculiarly literary difficulty in proving itself American which no other nation had ever had
Emerson with his fragmentation of British literary models his principled stand against good form began to break the hold England still had on the language of America
This hold was utterly broken only with Stein s twentiethcentury transgressions of all such sense and sensibility
""
But Emerson was considerably more than just a literary theorist and Stein who shared all his central literary concerns originality power genius language followed him in translating these into more general psychological terms
Human subjectivity life was not exclusively the domain of writing and they both desired to examine its operations in the broadest possible light
One would then see more completely and nonreductively how writing actually did figure in it
For Emerson s great theme was the experience of the individual confronted by and confronting in a single embrace the self and the universe the self in the universe the universe in the self
Nevertheless his was not a psychology of the self if for no other reason than that the word self seems only to have played a marginal almost incidental role in the expression of his thought
He rarely used the term apart from emphatic pronouns like himself and compound nouns like selfreliance and this is a fact about him that has been obscured for us by such extraordinary readers of his as Freud and William James who have made the term so indispensable within the current intellectual climate
It was Emerson to be sure who made the term indispensable But what are we to do with the fact that this is his single use of self naked and exposed in the essay
What is the aboriginal Self on which a universal reliance may be grounded What is the nature and power of that sciencebaffling star without parallax without calculable elements which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions if the least mark of independence appear
What are we to make of this What does it make of us
First it is true that Emerson possessed a host of other terms that corresponded with various ways of understanding what we call the self
These would include in this one essay man the soul genius mind human nature consciousness my nature my constitution a great soul every pure and wise spirit his will something godlike in him my giant essential man
All of these different as they are contribute to the remarkable definition Emerson proposed for the power that transforms selfreliance from selfpossession or mere confidence into a way of acting among others as that which relies because it works and is
Certainly this is the self but Emerson would refuse to name it here precisely because as he had suggested a few sentences earlier in what are among his most famous lines life only avails not the having lived
Power ceases in the instant of repose it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state in the shooting of the gulf in the darting to an aim
To name the self is to kill it off to deactivate or unplug it to put it to rest and one might say that the strength of Emerson s psychology perhaps of what he he had to say about it resided in an accommodation of restlessness that was summed up in his refusal to call a self a self
""
But if in spite of this refusal he still did conjure up a Self capitalized like a proper name and echoing sylph its opposite number it would be fair to say that at least there is nothing of the psychological in this aboriginal ground this ground of all originality
In categorizing the Self as a sciencebaffling star Emerson distanced himself from the lines of Beaumont and Fletcher he used as an epigraph to the essay Man is his own star and the soul that can Render an honest and a perfect man Commands all light all influence all fate Nothing to him falls early or too late
Our acts our angels are or good or ill Our fatal shadows that walk by us still
These on Emerson s own pseudoscientific figuration without parallax without calculable elements yet remain merely in orbit around his sciencebaffling questions
They offer up a weak because humancentered reading of what is essentially a negative originating denaturing even unmanning gesture on Emerson s part
The moment he acts from himself tossing the laws the books idolatries and customs out of the window we pity him man no more but thank and revere him for it is only in such acts that the least mark of independence appears and that we can testify that someone has been genuinely touched by the negative nonscientific and nonpsychological mark of the individual
The moment someone acts apart from himself he participates in an aboriginal Self which has nothing to do with a personal self and daily existence
It is a sign of Emerson s own independence and of the crucial element of negation in it that he should call is not
After her immensely successful sixmonth lecture tour through America in and much as Emerson had lectured across America in the s and s Stein chose to describe the country she had revisited for the first time in thirtyone years in categories that exactly corresponded to Emerson s distinction between dependent and independent human existence
Her terms human nature and human mind were as disembodied and abstract even as undistinctive as she could make them but in the course of the extended meditation she wrote during the summer of which she called The Geographical History of America she gave them a twist that was not only distinctly American but enabled her to redefine them strictly with regard to America
We use the same words as the English do she wrote some years later but the words say an entirely different thing
She determined that the lie of the land in America its geographical situation was the plumb line
It was always seen as if from above flattened out whereas in other countries it took on the features of human nature and daily existence
America was thus uniquely transcendental with the disembodiment of Americans and of their writing embodied as it were in the land
In other words America was even more a state of mind than were other countries and this is quite obviously true
Americans for example might claim the country as theirs to make over only by forgetting the aboriginal claims of the population they were in the process of murdering and disenfranchising
With their transcendentalisms both Emerson and Stein responded to the simultaneous impossibility and necessity of living with the blood of genocide on one s hands and writing
This was the true lie of the land
The saving grace as well as a large part of the horror was that it was so easy not to acknowledge the brutal facts and to imagine a virgin America that bore no relation to s paragraphs just floated floated up there
Stein providing in The Geographical History of America an analysis of the American writing that she and Emerson and a few others invented and reinvented pointed to the relation between it and the awful blank of American geographical history
The lines at the bottom of the first page tell all In the United States there is more space where nobody is than where anybody is
That is what makes America what it is
""
When Emerson described man he did not talk of the person one might meet anytime in Concord Massachusetts or Cheyenne Wyoming but focused on the individual removed from what Stein called the daily life every day during those moments when a person appeared to transcend him or herself
It was in such discontinuous moments that man as Emerson chose to call this generic as well as transcendent human being was truest to himself not only to his nature but to nature when in becoming that he contained all nature inside him
Only then did one fully possess a sense of oneself a consciousness of one s self as something entirely different from one s workaday existence
Beginning with the equations of man and nature in his first book Nature Emerson grounded his idea of nature so thoroughly in his idea of man that in effect there was no nature for him that did not have reference to or indeed take its form from man
Wilderness as nature untouched by man signified nothing for him other than as an irrelevant historical fact because he would not countenance a slovenly sprawling nature without the touch of man on it no Tennessee that is without its Stevensian jar
The extent that nature did sprawl was just another sign however pathetic of man s inescapable presence
Despairing of much that he had formerly championed but still fortified in his central equation Emerson could ask in his late essay Fate why should we are made up of the same elements A nonhuman universe might pose the threat of an irreconcilable difference for being human we sometimes forget that we are also nonhuman
Alternatively we might feel threatened by the similarity it would mean that we too were not human
In either case the only sufficiently human response to such a threat would be to embrace it not in the manner of Christ but after Jacob wrestling at Peniel
Nature whether human or nonhuman Emerson insisted was the same as man whether human or nonhuman and it was only armed with this equation with its absence of calculable elements that one might hazard the unknown and the hitherto unknowable
William James s transformation of psychology from philosophical colony to independent science his brother s arduous unsettling masterful novels of consciousness Gertrude Stein s reinvention of America and Americans in the name of a distinctly American language these were all expressions of the same bravado
They are variations Emerson was continually prophesying man Stein had merely to point to herself
Although she too combined a profound suspicion of the self with an unrepentant individualism she could write about herself more readily than Emerson did
However discontinuous her sense of self she still knew that she was completing his prophecies
In calling for liberating poets Emerson had in effect liberated the poets and Stein could thus afford to be less disinterested in her language than either Emerson or William James because she had learned from them the full extent to which language had its uses both as something to be made use of and as something that often unavoidably made use of us
Primarily in the powerful discontinuities of his rhetoric and in the ways these contribute to the intensity of his writing Emerson came closest to the sense Stein had of language as a living moving acting entity
One had to respond to and come to terms with it almost as if it were another person
When uses of the term self Emerson called the poet s songs his new self he certainly meant to suggest something of this
Only he went on to idealize the poet s relation to language characterizing the poetry as the poet s progeny and a heavenly progeny no less
His relation to his own language inasmuch as the essays were a kind of prosepoetry is actually much better served by Stein s description of poetry than by his own on which hers was based
The poet he said is the Namer or Languagemaker naming things sometimes after their appearance sometimes after their essence and giving to every one its own name and not another s
This is all very well but it tells us remarkably little about what the experience of such naming might be like
The experience as we see it etched everywhere in Emerson s own writing was concerned Stein announced in her Lectures in America with using with abusing adoring with replacing the noun
One has only to examine Emerson s daily waltz with the self to see how this works
It was the way that writing worked in Stein s life the life she wrote about that made her autobiographical project so much like Emerson s
There is more to this resemblance than the peculiarly unfinished styles and the generally incomplete nature of their works more even than the fact that they developed similar critiques of the unitary self at the same time that they constructed whimsical yet often deadly serious authorial selves
What they chiefly have in common is a particular relation of the life to the work
Where they differ is in the way this relation has been generally understood while Emerson s work has been elevated to the status of a necessary myth dwarfing his life Stein s own work is rarely read yet her life is gigantic sheer overwhelming
It has been said of Emerson that no biography can be written of his life because he lived that no account of the events in his life can begin to do justice to the strength and strangeness of his writing or rather the events that count in the life of the writing are the acts of writing themselves
The writing is alienated from the life as it is normally and narrowly understood
The sole biography that would live up to the standards of Emerson s own work would be one that not only acknowledged that his writing was always a kind of autobiography but which insisted that what he had to say about himself whether directly or indirectly was always about himself as a man writing homo scribers
The writing must not be reduced to psychodrama whether Freudian or otherwise if we are going to do justice to either the man or his work
One importance of Emerson lies at least in part in the way he makes us recognize both the strength of our psychologizing tendencies and the necessity of restraining them
Still not all psychologizing is of a piece
There are in essay whose title Natural History of Intellect Stein echoed in The Geographical History of America is the mould into which everything is poured like warm wax and be it astronomy or railroads or French revolution or theology or botany it comes out Peter
The exhilarating thing about such subjectivism is that as Emerson noted in the same essay every man is a new method and distributes things anew but because what is new quickly loses its novelty when it is repeated this particular form of individuality needs always to be accompanied by the denial of system if it is to remain original
It takes method to restrain method and in this case only a fragmentary style will remove the personal from the methodical
The personality of the observing subject is thereby consumed leaving what Emerson elsewhere would call one s character in full possession of the field
When on the occasion of an early lecture on Francis Bacon he praised Bacoll s detached observations Emerson meant by to suggest that there was no objectivity no way of sequestering one object from the embarrassing variety this is from the lecture Art in Essays First Series and looking at it as somewhat foreign from Natural History of Intellect that was not fragmentary
For both Stein and Emerson the true test of character and of ones resistance to a subjectivity that identified everything as one s own and lay behind all forms of systematizing was linguistic
Only at the grammatical level of putting words next to each other and shoving the language around which Stein observed in her late autobiographical text Wars I Have Seen was what enabled the Americans to appropriate the English language for themselves and finish the business of the Revolution might one partake of an alternate subjectivity that resisted any conceivable fixing of identity
In Poetry and Grammar one of the lectures she gave in America Stein explained that the only activity that had been the diagraming of sentences which she described as an experience of completely possessing something and incidentally one s self
It was this contingent grounding of the self in language that constituted her entirely Emersonian response to Emerson s own quietly astounding description of thought as a stream in Natural History of Intellect which James would put to such good use
In my thought I seem to stand on the bank of a river and watch the endless flow of the stream floating objects of all shapes colors and natures nor can I much detain them as they pass except by running beside them a little way along the bank
But whence they come or whither they go is not told me
Only I have a suspicion that as geologists say every river makes its own valley so does this mystic stream
It makes its valley makes its banks and makes perhaps the observer too
To understand what Stein was doing with the incidental self she presented as an author one language that is as exclusively grammatical but along more Emersonian and rhetorical lines as activated by it
She was always a moving target crossing over and under bridges made of words
More readily than the Emerson of the public writings although not of the extraordinary twentyvolume journal she lends herself at one and the same time to psychological accounts of literature and to accounts that would substitute language or writing for the author because her writing is always about herself and about ways of removing herself from it
Besides such varieties of psychologizing that emphasize one s subjectivity there is also the more literally objective case wherein everything can be seen as if it were a version of oneself
It was this form of making the world over that Emerson had in mind when he wrote in an oblique commentary on the title of his Natural History of Intellect that from whatever side we look at Nature we seem to be exploring the figure of a disguised man
Such anthropomorphism merely as a disguised man but as a muchsimplified version of man
Emerson s insistence on complicating any idea we might have of ourselves and on drawing new circles instead of resting with any particular idea of the self was meant to safeguard us against this prospect
The model of nature as a disguised man requires that there be no limit to the disguises of man
The corollary that there are necessary limits to what one can know obliged Emerson to posit ignorance as constitutive of the self and this held for Stein too
When she confessed in Wars I Have Seen that I always take it for granted that people will know who I am and at the same time at the last moment I kind of doubt it is the combination of so much selfassurance with the lingering selfdoubt and the remarkable precision of her expression in the composed and utterly deflating movement from always to at the same time and then at the last moment kind of doubt that marks her as Emersonian
An intellectual man Emerson wrote in Natural History of Intellect or as Stein must have read it an intellectual woman
has the power to go out of herself and see herself as an object therefore her defects and delusions interest her as much as her successes
She not only wishes to succeed in life but she wishes in thought to know the history and destiny of a woman
It was this desire to know and even to prophesy their own histories and destinies that caused Stein and Emerson to go out of themselves and to write their histories their destinies their representative lives their own biographies themselves yet except perhaps in the matter of degree this alone is not sufficient to distinguish them from other intellectual men and women with the same need to know and to write
And I said there was Emerson Stein recalled in an essay she wrote the modest title I Came And Here I Am and there was Hawthorne and there was Edgar Poe and there was Walt Whitman and there was well in a funny way there was Mark Twain and then there was Henry James and then there was well there is well I am
In this account of her literary genealogy Stein illustrates the chief lineaments of Emerson s legacy
Then there was well there is well I am
The fragmentary nature of this the obvious discontinuity of the transitions the American quality as it can be called of the syntax and the diction the abstractness of it these all play a part but the essential aspect is first the replacement of the past by the present there was wo nt quite work and then along with this a doubt as to the very existence of the self there is wo nt do I am it must be
Stein then in the course of acknowledging her own indebtedness to a line of American writers succeeds in foregrounding the absolute discontinuity between herself and them
As they are relegated to the past and with the same gesture their considerable differences ironed out by a repetitive formula there was

they drop off into a writer s oblivion leaving their strengths for Stein to assume as she will
Emerson somewhere in that oblivion would have been proud of his pupil although as the original Emersonian he would have had to be prouder of himself for having produced such a wonder and at the same time rendered anxious by the suspicion that he might have learned something from her
In her variously autobiographical writings Stein positioned herself directly against the strongly antiEmersonian antiindividualist theory of literary production that found its classic expression in T S Eliot s essay Tradition and the Individual called the effect the dominant tone of a poem in the combination of a structural emotion which the entire dramatic situation of the work provided with a number of floating feelings that the writer attached to particular words or phrases or images
Eliot aimed in his impersonal theory of poetry to divert interest from the poet to the poetry and consequently chose to minimize the importance for the writer of the particular events in his life
It was only a short step from this to the antiintentionalist line developed by Wimsatt and Beardsley a generation or so later and it is precisely this divorce of the writer from the writing that as the alternative emphasis in Stein s work suggests was meant to serve as a way of limiting both the writing and the variety of selves that might be entertained in the writing to something more manageable something altogether less individual
When Wimsatt made the perfectly reasonable claim in his essay of past moments become less and less clear as time passes it was in order that he might better discriminate between the cogently organized artistic structure of a work of literature and the mere particularities of personal moments
It was just this discrimination that Stein in more than forty years of writing made a little harder to make as she tried to do away with or do without both the cogently organized artistic structure and the sense that the particularities of personal moments could be dismissed as merely transitory and minor
Instead she wanted to organize artistic structure on the basis of the particularities of the personal moment looking for what one might well call cogently organized structures of disorganization or cogently disorganized constructions of selfhood as being truer to her sense of the difficulties an Emersonian individualism the Emerson of our moods do not believe in each other would come up against in the twentieth century
Often the difficulties the reader is confronted with in one back for relief to the more familiar complexities of our own late twentiethcentury lives and it was to counter retreats like this from her terrible simplicities Emerson s words from The Poet that Stein provided various accounts beginning with the lecture she delivered at Cambridge and Oxford Composition as Explanation of why she wrote the way she did of what it was that as she often said was bothering her at different times
If these accounts do not exactly provide a foundation on which to build Stein was not in the business of providing foundations they do serve the function of showing that interpretation is possible
They get one over a threshold that had threatened to nip even the prospect of interpretation in the bud and that is about all they can do with this writing that is so foreign to the conventions of both literary and everyday language
On the subject of the related unconventionality of Matisse and Picasso Stein wrote in made it impossible to deny that a painting no matter how shocking actually was a painting
When Matisse s La Femme au chapeau the first of his works that Stein and her brother Leo boughtwas exhibited at the autumn salon in Paris in it infuriated the public they tried to scratch off the paint
It was not attractive Stein observed precisely because it was so original just as the early Picassos were awful ugly
They were much more difficult to grasp and therefore accept than prettier more derivative work
The paintings were a bother but they did not present the artist with the bother of a refusal
""
Stein however repeatedly experienced such refusals with her writing
Whereas no one seriously denied that Matisse and Picasso were painters crude or garish as their work might appear when Stein sent the manuscript of Three Lives to a vanity press to get it published herself confronted with the following situation as she recalled it in the Autobiography
One day some one knocked at the door and a very nice very american young man asked if he might speak to Miss Stein
She said yes come in
He said I have come at the request of the Grafton Press
Yes she said
You see he said slightly hesitant the director of the Grafton Press is under the impression that perhaps your knowledge of english
But I am an american said Gertrude Stein indignantly
Yes yes I understand that perfectly now he said but perhaps you have not had much experience in writing I suppose said she laughing you were under the impression that I was imperfectly educated
He blushed why no he said but you might not have had much experience in writing
It proved to be all too easy for people to refuse Stein s writing by leveling such ad hominem attacks on her somehow obvious ignorance
Among the as Explanation that appeared in The Calendar of Modern Letters a shortlived but highly intelligent and provocative British periodical in which Stein was described as possessing an intellect so cloudy as to be literally defective
Her response to the very nice very american young man in the Autobiography is to the contrary so decisive that it asks to be read not just as one incident in a book comprised of many such incidents but as a declaration of her own independence as a writer once and for all
It s alright she said to the young man I will write to the director and you might as well tell him also that everything that is written in the manuscript is written with the intention of its being so written and all he has to do is to print it and I will take the responsibility
""
Stein s insistence here that her independence and her composition the conscious manipulation of her language be respected could well have been Emerson s did
First as a woman she could count on less intellectual respect among both Americans and Europeans than a male American writer would receive even in provincial England
Emerson on the other hand was given a great deal of benefit of the doubt both at home and abroad with the consequence that his intentions were often wildly misconstrued
But at least he was read and respected
Moreover Stein was mistaken when she proposed that the form of American writing was always the form of the contemporary English one
Much as this had certainly been true of Emerson s writing it was not true of her own which had more in common with the paintings of Picasso and the postmodernism of the s and s than it had with the work of British contemporaries like Edith Sitwell Virginia Woolf and Wyndham Lewis
Other American writers resembled the British but not Gertrude Stein
Her alliance with Emerson comes across particularly clearly in the compositional history of some works that are she collected in Matisse Picasso and Gertrude Stein
This was one of five books that she and Toklas published under the Plain Edition imprint with the proceeds from the sale of an early Picasso Woman with a Fan
Although published in shortly after Stein wrote the Autobiography the three pieces in Matisse Picasso and Gertrude Stein dated back to and 
They were written around the time she completed her blockbuster novel The Making of Americans no novel really but the negative image of one everything a novel is not when she embarked on what was to be an even longer work which she optimistically named A Long Gay Book
Simultaneously as she recalled in her Lectures in America she began several shorter books which were to illustrate the Long Gay Book one called Many Many Women another Five another Two and another GMP Matisse Picasso and Gertrude Stein
""
In the bulk of The Making of Americans and in her initial conception of A Long well as literary
She had been busy with the complete description of something with ultimately the complete description of anything with ultimately the complete description of everything which was as she recalled decades later how William James had characterized the pursuit of science
She wanted to describe in the earlier work every possible kind of human being and in the subsequent one every possible relation between human beings
But instead A Long Gay Book turned into A Long Gay Book which was published together with Many Many Women as the two shorter stories of the Plain Edition Matisse Picasso and Gertrude Stein with two shorter stories
Stein began writing Many Many Women and A Long Gay Book near the end of during a break in the writing of The Making of Americans which continued until the autumn of the following year
At the same time she began to compose short portraits of acquaintances among the first one called Ada moved into the apartment Stein shared with her brother Leo
The portraits Stein wrote early in mainly of artists she knew included those of Matisse and Picasso that Alfred Stieglitz later published in his journal Camera Work
In these Stein tried to portray their attitudes toward themselves what they looked like to themselves by conveying the relation between what they were saying and how they were saying it
In Lectures in America she described her technique I said what I knew as they said and heard what they heard and said until I had completely emptied myself of all they were that is all they were in being one hearing and saying what they heard and said
""
It was in fact these portraits and the challenge they presented to her scientific project that enabled Stein to complete The Making of Americans later that year although in a new mode that she would come to call philosophical
Philosophy as she said in her lecture on The Gradual Making of The Making of one stopped continuing describing everything in relation to other things and began to focus on each discrete moment when like Emerson one tried to portray objects or states of consciousness instead of merely describing them
Philosophy was thus the province of the thinginitself and Kant s descriptions would count as science
Near the end of the novel which she wrote that fall in the course of the extraordinary portrait of the dying protagonist Stein suggests that what distinguishes one person from another is the way of experiencing anything and expressing that thing
The earlier portraits were an ingenious solution to the problem of conveying a person s innermost nature for they did not require her to claim that one could somehow enter into another person s consciousness as one might with a fictional character
Stein was portraying the experience of someone talking and listening and she merely had to claim that the simultaneous expression of that experience might be caught in the movements of the talk itself
These portraits were quite literally verbal precisely of their relations to words as well as portraits in Stein s own words
Through the fall and winter of Stein continued to work on her group portraits
There was an inherent tension however between her general concern to describe what any one feels acts and does in relation to any other one as she characterized it later and her recent successes in individual portraiture
The tension was resolved in Many Many Women only by ending the work
The last paragraph offers a model for her dilemma it consists of a string of ones which are initially related in one form or another thus it begins Any one and any one one and one and two and one and one and one and one and many and one and some and one and any one
""
""
yet it ends on an affirmation of individuality The one who is the one who is that one any one is that one and any one any one is one and one is one and one and one and one and one and one and one
""
Stein perfected the remarkably abstract and disembodied language of these portraits in order to rid the words of her private associations and of any obvious reference to her life
Leo Stein s criticism as she reported it in Everybody s Autobiography is still trenchant however
He said it was not it it was I If I was not there to be there with what I did then what I did would not be what it was
In other words if no one knew me actually then the things I did would not be what they were
Stein is certainly correct when she insists that this was not entirely true and that one does not need to know what the writing originally referred to in order to get a good deal out of it nevertheless she was unable to remove the traces of the removal of referentiality but knowing full well that someone has removed the local references
The demand for embodiment has not been quieted
It was because these portraits still had to be filtered through Stein s own consciousness that she decided in the summer of to use words that ideally had nothing in them of what she later called the quality of description
As long as the words continued to function at all descriptively not only would the object or individual state of consciousness be removed from the discrete present moment but it would necessarily be described as it appeared to her instead of being portrayed as it was itself
For Stein no less than for Emerson a person was a mode of being in particular a mode of making and getting one s way and an adequate portrait would have to convey the individual s tendency or direction without objectifying it that is without equating it with what was already known
That Stein wanted to do something which seemed impossible since she could her own was objection
Its impossibility was precisely what interested her
After all as she explained in her lecture on The Making of Americans she had stopped describing everything only when she was at last really convinced that a description of everything was possible
Just as Emerson wrote whim on the lintels of his doorpost Stein might have nailed up the sign if it can be done why do it to give prospective readers some idea of the uncompromising and hardy transcendentalism they would find in her writing
The portraits composed in early thus not only enabled Stein to complete The Making of Americans later that year but also opened up the way for the technical innovations of and most notably in her portraits of Objects Food and Rooms in Tender Buttons
Rather than choosing words for their descriptive value she began to compose with them in much the same way that Matisse and Picasso composed with she recalled in one of her Lectures in America I related words then sentences then paragraphs to the thing at which I was looking
Words she felt could be made to possess meaning solely in their grammatical rhetorical and metrical aspects not as concepts per se or as representations but in their materiality
The analogy to Matisse and Picasso is not incidental
Although Stein had known the two artists and with her brothers collected their works since she introduced them to each other they were particularly on her mind during this transitional period in her writing
In February the portraits she had composed of them were accepted for publication by Stieglitz who proposed to print a special number of Camera Work with he said in a letter dated February a few Picasso s and a few Matisse s reproduced as illustrations to accompany your text
He added You have undoubtedly succeeded in expressing Matisse and Picasso in words for me in it had been at Stein s own expense this was her first acceptance after years of rejections and Stieglitz was accepting her on equal terms with Matisse and Picasso
Sometime that spring Stein began work on the piece she called GMP Although she referred to it in one letter as the long one about the Paris crowd it was more precisely an account of and an accounting for the relative accomplishments of the three leaders of the art world Matisse Picasso and herself
Her faith along with Toklas s in her own genius was a rather lonely affair in Paris unpublished and unread as she was in a country whose native tongue was not English and where she did not move in a particularly literary circle
If she had
she would have fared no better women were not encouraged to write in the French avantgarde
Stieglitz s recognition was a muchneeded boost and Stein made the most of it
That same spring she The Architect s Table a late work of high Analytic Cubism
Picasso had painted her calling card into the composition after she had left it at his studio as a joke she recalled in the Autobiography
His appropriation of her signature however was no joke
In the first place the signature was in the lower right corner of the oval painting which suggested that she might have painted it
Was it a representation of any work of hers Of what her work might become As when people questioned the likeness of his earlier portrait of her and he said that she would come to look like it Was any of her writing as superb as this Was this the best she could do Alternatively he could be seen as defining her in terms of her social relation to him rather shall as a fellow artist the kind of woman who left her calling card had a salon might buy his paintings
Moreover painting the other being Ma Jolie
In the Autobiography the juxtaposition is hastily defused with a referential appeal As we went away Gertrude Stein said Fernande is certainly not ma jolie I wonder who it is
In a few days we knew
Pablo had gone off with Eve
The rather crude joke is that Stein certainly was nt ma joke either
But if ma jolie could be decoded as Picasso s new mistress Eve to his Adam then who did Miss Gertrude Stein refer to Who Gertrude Stein might ask was Miss Gertrude Stein Was she the signatory of an already considerable body of literature Was she the close friend of this protean artist Of the earlier portrait she would write in the Autobiography that after painting her head out in the spring in the fall out of his head Picasso painted the head in without having seen Gertrude Stein again like Zeus giving birth to Athena and in her book on satisfied with my portrait for me it is I and it is the only reproduction of me which is always I for me
Now he had painted a portrait of her signature
It was with this threat to her individuality and to her originality for if he could reproduce her so readily was she perhaps merely copying Picasso s techniques and the challenge she had received from Stieglitz as well as her dissatisfaction with her abstract writing style for the ambitious program of portraiture she was contemplating that Stein left Paris to spend the summer with Toklas in Spain
She wanted to make portraits that approached selfportraits whether they were of other people or what she called in the Autobiography the rhythm of the visible world she aimed to present what was seen or heard in the way that it saw itself
She had therefore to begin by actively refucing which was not at all the same as refilling whatever she might know through not know what I knew about everything what I knew about anything she asserted in Lectures in America and immediately followed this with an example of how the positive negation she had in mind operated And so the Long Gay Book little by little changed from a description of any one and everything there was to be known about any one to what if not was not not to be not known about any one about anything
What if not was not not to be not known about
""
""
By this succession of negatives the writing was transformed into the expression and the experience of the unknown what is not never was and never will be known
This was something that was entirely a matter of supposition what if and by the same token absolutely irrefutable
Perhaps it only existed in the writing certainly it was an experience of some kind yet as different from ordinary experience as the world of Emerson s thoughts it was Stein s quite literal concentration on the negative that in purely formal terms served to liberate her style from the monumental and pseudoscientific rhythms of The Making of Americans and made possible later that summer and fall the delicate miracles of Tender Buttons
The works that Stein carried with her to Spain Two Jenny Helen Hannah Paul and Peter A Long Gay Book and GMP all flesh out this quintessentially Emersonian moment of transition from a past to a new state
They are transitional both literally and figuratively instances of it and stances toward it
Like Picasso s portrait of her and his Desmoiselles they aim to study change tease it out to portray movement without resorting to the illusion the repose of either narrative sequence or the new medium of the motion picture
A few pages after the new style is introduced in A Long Gay Book with the gentle little tinkle of A tiny violent noise is a yellow happy thing and the increasing quantity of negations Stein comments that she could not be saying that authorising something was believing that she was not having what she was having
This indirect almost indeterminate note on her writing is followed by a correspondingly decisive statement on its own writing Now I have it
Now I see
This is the way
Not that way
The other way is not the way
It is a tangible moment of selfrecognition when Stein sees her way and sees herself already on it
The next sentence which opens a new paragraph completes this local study of transition A lively way to call is to run and call and a lively way to stand is to stand
""
One of the effects of the shift in style in these pieces is that it becomes increasingly haled while reading them to attend to the author
It is not that contrary it appears that much more subjective and obviously written but nonetheless the sense of a stable consistent author goes out the window
Some kind of individual force undoubtedly remains to distinguish the actual creation from what Stein in the Autobiography characterized as the sensitiveness of the hysteric even if it is only the outrageous conceit that yoked the styles together in the first place
But Stein was able here to cut her writing loose so that it was no longer anchored in either the personality or the impersonality of the author
She was probably noting this herself when she wrote in A Long Gay Book that largely additional the earlier style and then completely exploding the later one is one way to deny authorisation
""
The point was not to deny the author s existence but to deny the claims made for any authorisation which could be grounded as readily in a cult of impersonality as a personality cult
It was the sense an authorized biography for instance that Stein utterly rejected
Another way of denying such authorization and another way of reading her formula can be seen in her manipulation of the title of the collection in which A Long Cay Book and GMP appeared alternately Matisse Picasso and Gertrude Stein and GMP The three titular figures are reduced to their literal characters and the order of these is shifted
This was surely an explosion a complete fragmentation of what was initially additive
What made for the throughness of Stein s antiautoritative stance was not however that the one title was reduced to the other but that the two titles continued to exist in tandem just as Stein s name appeared both in the title and on the titlepage
Any such distancing of herself from what still had to be called her self whether accomplished as it was here or in a work like the thirdperson Autobiography raised doubts about the self and about any authority derived from it Again it was not that Stein did away with the self or even rejected it but that by exploiting a formal discrepancy between the two wildly divergent styles in Matisse Picasso and Gertrude Stein she was able to get away from it at least in pieces like these
Her doubts about the self were in fact inextricably linked with the set of doubts that characterized Matisse s and Picasso s own work
Matisse she explained in her study of Picasso began to doubt what his eyes could see and Picasso carried this even further in his long struggle not to express what he could see but not to express the things he did not see that is to say the things everybody is certain of seeing but which they do not really see
Emerson made the same point when he observed in SelfReliance that these roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones they are for what they are as they are and not merely to observe what is anticipated or remembered one has to rid oneself empty oneself of everything one already knows one has to get out of the habit as Stein put it of knowing what one was looking at
Stein understood so clearly what Picasso was doing because he was in his painting Emerson all over again
The hysterical blindness that Emerson experienced as a student at the Harvard Divinity School left its mark on his transcendentalism with the result that his own selfdoubts as any glance at his writing will show were always tied up with doubts as to what and whether his eyes could see
Matisse Pablo and I Stein observed in a notebook she kept during the writing of The Making of Americans do not do ours with either brains or character we have all enough of both to do our job but our initiative comes from within a propulsion which we or instinct or intuition all Emerson s words is another version of the aboriginal Self only invoked in a terminology better suited to the twentieth century it is the same deep force that is addressed in SelfReliance to which all involuntary perceptions are due and which paradoxically guar
antees one s individuality by insuring that one s perception of anything is as much a fact as the sun itself
Place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which animates all whom it Hoats Emerson preached in the essay he called Spiritual Laws and you are without effort impelled to truth to right and a perfect contentment
Your constitution he added would then organize itself as do now the rose and the air and the sun
Stein shared these convictions with him but what he proposed as a way to live she developed as a way of writing a part of life whereas Stein was much quicker to incorporate the minute particulars of life into her own writing
Yet for both of them if life was essentially something that was written it also had less to do with the peripheral and particular activity of writing than they would have liked
It is finally this alternately diverging and converging movement between life and writing rather than any distinct concept of life or writing that they shared and which makes for the commerce between them
The lack of connection then between life and writing was not they both rather desperately hoped a sign of a deeper repression of a deeper yet still too shallow connection but simply a consequence of the impermanence of any connection one might make
It was not that there were none but that every connection was temporary a placeholder
The essential thing was the making of connections not the connections themselves
The best explanation of what one was doing in writing was therefore to be found as its own explanation as Stein suggested both the reader and the writer were freed to make their own connections and to draw their own conclusions
But they could only exercise this freedom within the constraint of trying to understand how the composition might be explained in its own terms how it would explain itself and the impossibility of ever getting this explanation exactly right was what enabled the writing to live on in any particular account of it
The writer s experience in the act of composition the reader s in construing such an act these were alternate explanations of the finished composition itself something that although it had no existence independent of these activities at the same time transcended them and remaining distinct from them just floated floated up there
For Stein as for Emerson a theory of life was necessarily indistinguishable from a theory of writing and if to a more British more orderly mind this must signify a cloudy intellect clouds above everything literally figuratively that spoke most profoundly of the life of things and of the permanent flux and of the writing on both sides of the wall

Wordsworth and the Enlightenment Nature Man and Society in the Experimental Poetry by Alan Bewell Yale University Press 
Wordsworth s Great Period Poems Four Essays by Marjorie Levinson Cambridge University Press The Contours of Masculine Desire Romaticism and the Rise of Women s Poetry by Marlon B Ross Oxford University Press 
A Historian of the past twenty or so years of literary criticism assuming anyone is willing to take on that job might conceive of it as the time when textuality triumphed when the forces of deconstruction successfully stormed the Bastille of monolithic meaning by demonstrating that all writing whatever its pretensions was prolific with tropes unstable decentered in a word literary
The historian could go on to describe how the professors of English in effect colonized other university departments
He would show that anthropologists philosophers and in some cases scientists were compelled to give up of the powers language has to expand divert and even to dissolve socalled literal meanings
Everyone in the university it seemed had to learn to read all over again and as the pupils of the advanced professors of literature
Suddenly there was nothing and no one outside of the text
A primary exhibit in our historian s case might be Richard Rorty s splendid recent book Contingency Irony and Solidarity
There Rorty besides doing many other things extends his critique of foundational thinking by endorsing philosophers such as William James Nietzsche and Wittgenstein who have been selfconsciously provisional speculative and sometimes even playful in their claims
These philosophers have given up on the goal of getting it right once and for all and buoyantly admit the contingent status of their reflections
They aspire for their books to be useful that is to make experience available in some relatively new terms that their readers might themselves profitably put lot different from people like Keats Wordsworth Whitman and Frost all of whom can be seen as introducing some unexpected subjects tropes and rhythms into poetry in an effort to refresh language and so perhaps the thoughts and lives of readers
And this is the best that philosophers ought to hope for as well
Rorty looks forward to the time when philosophy will be willing to resign its aspirations to becoming the queen of the sciences the role Kant aspired for it to play and surrender on honorable terms to literature
Rorty s hope might provide the sort of dying fall on which a book devoted to our critical climate could come discreetly to a close
But the story that book told would be at best a partial one
Plato said that the struggle between philosophy and poetry was already old in his time and it would be presumptuous to think that we have terminated it in ours
In the past twenty years the language of literary criticism has fiction accepting more and more terms from the analytical disciplines
As it frequently happens in the political world a sort of reverse colonization has been taking place the empire strikes back
To call a literary critical study authentically interdisciplinary nowadays is to pay it the highest compliment
What that compliment usually means is that the work in question has succeeded in translating the language of literature repeatedly into the terms of more generalizing and accordingly more stable areas of knowledge
""
For whatever people like de Man and Derrida and even Rorty may affirm about textuality large categories usually philosophical in origin eventually emerge to discipline the textual disorder
De Man s dialectic between theory and undecidability Derrida s opposition of the metaphysics of presence and difference and too Rorty s contrasting categories the essential and the contingent at least partially restore the sorts of conceptual framework that each writer sets out to dissolve
In a chapter titled The Contingency of Selfhood offers the view very close to Shelley s that cultural change results when one invented vocabulary capable of vitally renewing experience displaces another that has grown inert
Rorty s own style a fluent and clear style that blends the sensibilities of Attic ironist and American Adam is a fine alternative to most of what s available now on the critical market
But Rorty also has frequent recourse to the traditional philosophical language of categories the sort that his book argues we ought to give up on
Writing philosophy is perhaps inseparable from working to confer auras on particular words the major philosophers choose new and surprising ones their epigones add a little to the lustre and disappear
A more literary prejudice is well expressed in Frost s observation that after you ve repeated a truth a couple of times it becomes less true
Say it with any frequency and it wo nt be true at all
On this subject Oscar Wilde is charmingly extreme When people agree with me I Criticism plays itself out between these two tendencies between concept and trope stability and motion
I would suggest that in this the moment of the interdisciplinary and despite the professed affection of critics for difference the seminal adventures of the trace and all the rest the practice of submitting literary writing to categories particularly of a moral and political sort is at an alltime high
Philosophy departments may be on the decline in some American universities surely they are in Great Britain but this may only be because philosophy as such is now operating out of the local department of English
Why has this taken place Why has literary criticism allowed itself to be so thoroughly infiltrated by the academic disciplines which it appears to have superseded What motivates contemporary criticism s quest to expand analytical vocabularies and with them to draw out the truths of literary texts truths about which literature itself is frequently conceived of as being innocent or selfservingly ignorant
Marjorie Levinson s Wordsworth s Great Period and Marlon Ross s The Contours of Masculine Desire all profess to reveal something about Wordsworth that common readers do nt know
An understanding of the nature of the three forms of literary critical knowledge these books offer will I think help to answer the questions I ve asked above
Perhaps too because these critics are all relatively young as well as being talented and energetic their work will allow us to guess at some of the future directions literary studies could take
Levinson s first chapter on Tintern Abbey has according to Paul Cantor in a recent issue of South Atlantic Quarterly already become a classic in the field of Romantic literary criticism
Surely Levinson s reading of Wordsworth s great selfreflective poem does epitomize a shift in the way many of the members of the younger generation of Romanticists are approaching their subject
Behind Fearful Symmetry Northrop Frye s book on Blake and Geoffrey Hartman s wellknown essays on Keats s To Autumn and the Hyperion poems the conviction that in some sense the Romantic poets were still out ahead of us
Frye believed that literary culture had yet to understand the truth of Blake s comprehensive view of the imagination Hartman that the sort of naturalistic humanism Keats arrives at in his last poems might still cure contemporary aspirations to transcendence
Both critics write in styles beholden to the authors they endorse attempting to transfer voice as well as values into their own cultural situations
Now late into his career Frye can still say Almost everything I know I learned from Blake
""
To Levinson as to many younger Romanticists the time for such identifications is gone for we no longer live in a world on which the Romantic metaphors have much bearing
It is the distance between the Romantics and ourselves the argument continues that permits more detached and revealing readings of their poetry than the sort that Hartman and Frye could manage caught as they were in the Romantic ideology
In the case of distance allows the critic to locate the repression that produces the poem s sublime intensities
What precisely is this repression and what is the new knowledge purchased at the expense of alienation that enables Levinson to see into the life of the Romantic poem
What s blocked out of Tintern Abbey as Levinson sees it is material reality and most particularly the reality of class conflict
On the day that Wordsworth sets his poem July the Abbey s grounds would have been full of beggars miserable and homeless who lived by soliciting alms from the middleclass tourists exercising their sensibilities on the ruins
The air around the Abbey would probably have been darkened by the smoke of charcoal fires the noise from the town ironworks busy casting cannons for the war with France would have grated against Wordsworth s somber meditations
The cottage plots that Wordsworth takes note of are green to the very door because the common lands had been enclosed some householder to cultivate was his tiny front garden
We are bound says Levinson to see that Wordsworth s pastoral prospect is a fragile affair artfully assembled by acts of exclusion
""
The strange mixture of meditative calm and extreme urgency that has intrigued readers of Tintern Abbey and has frequently been assigned to Wordsworth s intimations of his own mortality here receives a more material explanation
To the question posed by her students which Levinson says helped get her inquiry into Wordsworth going Where is the Abbey in the poem the essay replies that it is repressed relegated to the poem s political unconscious
The primary poetic action Levinson writes is the suppression of the social
""
Perhaps the essay suggests Romantic poetry the poetry of the inner self is nothing more than a middleclass effort to evade the press of too many people the claims of society one s responsibility to history
Perhaps critics who that evasion in the present like Wordsworth s the blindness of the Romantic critics might stand as a testament to the horrors of contemporary exploitative capitalist culture from which they too are compelled to turn away with the full force of repression
In Levinson s analysis the homeless people excluded from Tintern Abbey become by the power of implication our homeless and those among us who sustain the Romantic ideology of inwardness stand indicted
Perhaps the most eloquent statement of this position remains Walter Benjamin s Without exception the cultural treasures one surveys have an origin which one can not contemplate without horror
They owe their existence not only to the efforts of the great minds and talents who have created them but also to the anonymous toil of their contemporaries
And then the famous aphorism There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism
""
Levinson s implication that repression lies at the center of the Romantic project both concurs
The Contours of Masculine Desire though takes the repression of femininity to be the crucial issue
Ross s hypothesis is as he puts it that the romantic ideology of the strong poet develops out of fear of the feminine
But he continues in attempting to assure their own sociopolitical strength by casting out and smoothing over the feminine romantic poets only manage to repress the feminine which returns with the full force of desire in many forms
Just as Levinson uses recent developments in Marxist thinking to know more of the Romantics class politics than they knew themselves Ross is drawing upon contemporary feminist studies to see more clearly into the Romantics anxious desire to repudiate femininity
Ross s focus on the strong poet calls to mind Harold Bloom and oddly enough Ross is in a certain sense a Bloomian critic
Following Bloom Ross reads Romantic poetry as being awash in Oedipal strife filial rivalry and the uninhibited worship of power modeling themselves after the military conquerors entrepreneurs and statesmen of their day
In saying as much he seeks to give the Bloomian view some historical support
Throughout the book s first half in which Ross reflects on the construction of the Romantic poetical character he takes Bloom s Anxiety of Influence quite literally except that he condemns the creative agon that Bloom with a few reservations peculiarly his own celebrates
The Contours of Masculine Desire is a sort of Bloom Moralise
Is it possible to disagree with critics like Ross and Levinson critics whose voices are so selfassured and whose ethical imperatives so admirable For what makes Levinson and Ross impatient with the Romantic ethos is of course what they take to be its appalling social cost
If as Frye and others have argued Romanticism is rightly understood as the internalization of the quest Romance with the poet however implicitly taking the part of the questing knight then what about the roles automatically assigned or class themselves have no access to the quest Inevitably they will be left out repressed in Levinson
s parlance or they will be stereotyped to serve the needs of the unfolding fiction as Ross believes women are in most Romantic work
If Romantic poetry is in its essence a testament to white male bourgeois power how prescient it was from this perspective for Lewis Carroll to call his parody of Resolution and Independence The White Knight s Song and if we still live to some degree within the Romantic ideology then the work of demystification that Ross and Levinson undertake must be of crucial importance
In what better way can the professor of Romantic poetry contribute to the spread of social justice And how could one criticize the political strategies of Ross and Levinson without oneself being justly accused of serving repressive interests
One might I suppose question the subtlety of Ross s reading of the Romantics and especially Wordsworth s Ross for insisting on the centrality of the question
Keeping within the Freudian vocabulary then it is worth pointing out that Wordsworth s attitude to femininity is better described as a matter of ambivalence than of repression
In The Ruined Cottage which was probably Wordsworth s first great poem F R Leavis thought it his finest overall it s clear that some part of Wordsworth identifies passionately with Margaret the woman who pines away and dies of grief for her missing husband
Margaret is someone who ca nt let go
She perishes because she will not surrender her attachment to the past her drive to recover what Wordsworth in regard to himself would describe as the glory and the dream
Margaret is akin to those poets Wordsworth describes in Resolution and Independence as beginning in gladness with a preternatural capacity for joy
But the danger is that they will come as a direct result of that early passion to despair and madness
Such figures appear Margaret but of Lucy of Dorothy in Tintern Abbey of the Winander Boy the child of the Great Ode
These figures inevitably women and children are Wordsworthian images for the source of poetic power
And yet the poet also knows that a full identification with any of them could end tragically
It would mean living almost entirely without defenses
Thus the proliferation in Wordsworth of figures of chastening wisdom Armytage in The Ruined Cottage the old leechgatherer in Resolution and Independence the Cumberland Beggar the discharged soldier in The Prelude figures who seem so stoically selfreliant as to be nearly invulnerable
One approach to Wordsworth would involve a careful tracing of the dialectics between his figures of passion and of restraint for Wordsworth is movingly restless in his desire to conceive and conceive again the question How do I go on living defending myself against the extreme susceptibility of a figure like Margaret but how do I continue too to have without that sensibility what we would recognize as authentically Wordsworthian poetry would not be possible
The poetry that comes from the mouths of characters like Armytage tends to be neoclassically sententious as when he says to the young narrator of The Ruined Cottage PREFORMATTED TABLE
But that is only one strain of Wordsworth s voice
Wordsworth s major poetry lives in the dialectic between spontaneity and defense joy and stoicism Margaret and Armytage
To claim as Ross does that the feminine is repressed in Wordsworth is to blunt Wordsworth s subtlety in the interest of a contemporary cultural polemic
If this highly abbreviated account of Wordsworth s dialectic does bear on the truth about the poetry shell it is also the case that as many others have noticed Wordsworth s major work arises from times of intense inner strife moments when whatever means are at the poet s disposal for figuring the self no longer suffice no longer provide access to experiential or poetic vitality
The movement at those times s key figures have both a naturalistic and an allegorical dimension
Steven Knapp speaks accurately of Wordsworth s having replaced the formal personifications of the eighteenth century with
""
""
quasiallegorical hut ostensibly natural figures
Such a movement is comparable to the one effected in Freudian therapy with the crucial difference that Wordsworth will concede to no one s terms for representing the drama of the inner self but his own
So understood Wordsworth s poetry is a poetry of performance and of process unfolding throughout his great period
Every major poem rewrites the last one and too all of those that come before
Such a perception is made less available not only by a critic like Levinson who reads major works chapters on Michael Intimations and Peele Castle follow the one on Tintern Abbey in isolation but by Wordsworth who eventually organized his poems thematically and not chronologically for publication
What I m saying is that the inward turn the allegorization of the human figures is probably little less so
To observe then that Wordsworth represses history runs the risk of making a trivial point for what autobiographical writer in his or her moments of most intense inward turning does not Wordsworth believed as many people in the West have for some time that severe introspection is the chief means by which the self can be transformed
Such introspection therapeutic in its intent may well be a prerequisite for effective action action which can but need not be of a public nature
And one might here offer a Freudian point keeping in mind that any critic who makes extensive use of the concept of repression which Freud called the cornerstone of our theories is if only temporarily a Freudian critic to be effective in the public world one needs to know the difference between anger at political injustice and resentment against one s neglectful father between the present and the past
This is something that in The White Knight s Song the poem continually betrays his own intense fear of inwardness a fear that Wordsworth continues even in the present to provoke
One might plausibly on political and ethical grounds reject the West s faith in introspection and the Cartesian insistence that the individual subject is the primary arbiter of reality
The critical objective then would be to refigure the self in more comprehensively social terms
And one could easily see such an inventive procedure beginning with a critique of Wordsworth beginning but not ending there
It is possible too that a critic even after having accepted the rapid characterization of Wordsworth s ambivalent relations to femininity that I offered above might decide that it was still in the interest of his or her readers and students to continue to demystify Wordsworth s images of femininity
For surely if Wordsworth allegorizes his women figures then he does to some extent stereotype them
And perhaps such Romantic stereotypes do inhere in
Yet a critic disposed to such demystification needs to take into account what one might call the rule of critical compensation to the degree that you read a text analytically to the degree that your terminology encompasses it claims to know the text better than it knows itself to that degree I think you give up the possibility of being read by it
Wordsworth continues to challenge us asking among other things how much we have turned against our own capacity for vital joy
For being blindly with one s blessedness at strife is to Wordsworth almost everyone s inescapable lot
It is the ability to be interrogated by transferring power onto great writing that the analytical reader sacrifices and such a reader ought to think carefully about whether the exchange is worth it
In this context one recalls that Narcissus s response to his many wooers in the time before he fell in love with his image in the pool was simple and abrupt I ll die before I that results from finding a critical position that will fix the truth of Romantic writing once and for all is akin to the power that people have sought for some time from philosophical systems
If the essential drive of Romantic writing is to impose masculine hegemony or historical repression or anything else for that matter then Romanticism can come at last under the control of concepts Wordsworth yes we know what he s all about
But a more accurate way to understand Romantic writing I think is to recognize it as being itself historicist always striving to render experience in such a way that it can not be assimilated to existing normative principles or to those that are likely to arise in the future
Surely one can say that Wordsworth at a certain point in his career does stop changing does let go of his dialectic
But the part of Wordsworth that responds to the press of events with new inventions still persists transferred I think into those critics of Romanticism who ve understood that no stabilizing analysis will do Romantic work justice
Harold Bloom s criticism is authentically Romantic not because it excludes female experience or because it ignores historical pressures both of which it does and at least as I see it to its detriment but because it is speculative and surprising and answers Romantic invention not with philosophical stabilities but with more invention
Bloom is nt out to get Romanticism right once and for all but to perpetuate its energies
Yet of course the academy and the culture at large demand cogent teachable truths and Ross offers a demonstration of how a way of thinking as apparently inassimilable as Bloom s can in time become something with which one agrees or disagrees rather than something that one can use as feminist critics like Sandra Gilbert and Margaret Homans have or forget about
Bloom says somewhere that he s a comic critic who seems condemned to getting serious reviews and Ross s seriousness like Levinson critic has after all uncovered a determining repression each has arrived at the somber truth about what makes Wordsworth and the Romantics in general what they are
The theory of repression the Dutch psychoanalyst J H van den Berg writes is closely related to the thesis that there is a sense in everything which in turn implies that everything is past and there is nothing new
Applying a theory of repression to Wordsworth then is an effort to relegate him to the past to literary history
He s someone who ca nt surprise us anymore
But as Freud himself came very close to admitting wielding the theory of repression puts the interpreter in a Heads I win tails you lose situation
If the subject agrees with the interpretation the interpreter must be right if she disagrees well how could she not Freud did give the patient an out she could disagree calmly enough to persuade the therapist that he was mistaken
But can offer no rebuttal to the charge of repression
Other readers who would counter the charge are naturally repressed themselves
With one word Ross and Levinson could dismiss the arguments I ve offered thus far
Once someone makes central use of the category of repression no real critical conversation is possible
What one faces then is cultural politics by fiat
And here it s worth making a distinction between Ross and Levinson on the one hand and a new historicist like Stephen Greenblatt on the other
Greenblatt s recent criticism focuses on the ways that energy circulates fiom cultural productions into politics and social life then back again
He claims for example that King Lear reworks material given to it by contemporary controversies over exorcism and that the reworking has a bearing in the public world
Lear does nt repress exorcism that would be to swallow the subject tip make it disappear with only the most oblique trace
Accordingly Greenblatt s text constitutes an interpretation a story one may may say that his facts are nt facts at all or that important ones have been neglected a few have
But at least one may disagree propose another story
A reader win claims to uncover a determining repression is attempting to achieve what one might call the interpretive sublime an act not quite transcendental but rather descendental in that it seeks penetration to ultimate depths rather than contact with a deity who reigns on high
Of course it s an open question as to why after the likes of William James and Jacques Derrida one can still claim Codlike powers of penetration in a critical text
What is it we might ask that could motivate this rather outdated and dictatorial claim that Romantic poetry is a function of repression and thus a thing exclusively of the past What s at stake in asserting that Wordsworth did nt know enough or could nt force enough through the veils of repression to be a creditable poet in this a more comprehensively aware to see the historical critics claim to a larger knowledge than the Romantics possessed within the tradition of critical response to Romanticism
For the charge that the Romantics did not know enough is of course a familiar one
The famous passage from Matthew Arnold s The Function of Criticism runs as follows
It has long seemed to me that the burst of creative activity in our literature through the first quarter of this century had about it in fact something premature and that from this cause its productions are doomed most of them in spite of the sanguine hopes which accompanied and do still accompany them to prove hardly more lasting than the productions of far less splendid epochs
And this prematureness comes from its having proceeded without having its proper data without sufficient materials to work with
In other words the English poetry of the first quarter of this century with plenty of energy plenty of creative force did not know enough
Did not know enough to translate that famous phrase so that did not know enough becomes had repressed too much
Levinson speaks revealingly at one point of the wisdoms sic of our own moment that very wisdom Wordsworth could not in produce
The bestknown inheritor of Arnold s sentiment about Romanticism was of course T S Eliot who castigated Romantic poetry for being fragmentary immature and chaotic as opposed naturally to classical work complete adult and orderly knowledgeable as well no doubt
With Arnold and Eliot as with Levinson and Ross criticizing the Romantics for their ignorance in contrast to some stable principle of knowledge is inseparable from a desire to serve culture by proposing normative ethical and political values
I am arguing then that the drive to cultural stability matters much more than the values conservative for Eliot and Arnold ostensibly progressive for Levinson and Ross in whose name the critical process is carried out
And Levinson and Ross in being hostile to the Romantics no one who wishes to set a myth of concern Frye s phrase in place is going to have much use for Emerson or Shelley or for a great deal of what Wordsworth wrote either
The description I have offered thus far may at first seem to be grossly unfair to two talented and learned critics who take themselves to be on the left not like Arnold and Eliot at all
Surely it makes difference to align oneself however critically with the tradition of Marx
Arnold and Eliot were critics of the middle class and overall not displeased with that fact
But to what degree are Ross and Levinson and indeed most members of the cultural left writing today authentically Marxist When the students who got Levinson s critical project moving by asking her where the Abbey was in the poem become graduate students they may ask her another question on the buildings and grounds theme Where was the university in your analysis of criticism that seem devoted to leftist politics rarely if ever address the institutional situation from which they arise
In Richard Ohmann published English in America a book that viewed professors of English as a class and reflected on their productive function within the prevailing capitalist economy
Ohmann argues that the profession functions ideologically for university professors of English
To him our immersion in scholarly writing in various learned societies in conferences in the compilation of bibliographies and the production of authorized editions serves to disguise from ourselves and others the reality of our social role
Our real task Ohmann believes is to serve capitalism
We teach students to write clearly and to abstract the meaning of texts to be punctual and obedient in ways that will directly serve the needs of the corporate world
We take pains to choose those students who will join the elite and to eliminate the ones who for whatever reason would not fit in
All of our professional exertions divert us from recognizing such a simplistic one for one thing there is surely a more dynamic exchange between the economic and the professional tasks than he admits but it is also immensely provocative
In this moment of leftwards turning in the academy it would seem logical to start refining Ohmann s views and taking up the practical politics his book enjoins
Something comparable has been going on in the Critical Legal Studies Movement where Duncan Kennedy and others have been writing what amount to anthropological critiques of the tribal customs of the law school and the legal profession while offering lots of suggestions for reform
But this is not happening in any dramatic way in the departments of English
As William Cain wrote in a recent retrospective piece on Ohmann English in America remains the first and last of its kind its concerns judged to be important but apparently not compelling enough to merit further study
Why one wonders has this happened
Why indeed
In very little of the work from the cultural left as a professor of English one must be sustained by and help sustain a culture that s taken to be exploitative racist and phallogocentric
Few professors if any seem to be writing essays enjoining their colleagues to cease dispensing grades surely a form of classroom capitalism or to stop writing letters of recommendation to objectionable corporations those continuing say to reap profits in South Africa or from the sale of weapons
Nor does anyone seem particularly interested in abolishing the hierarchies that preside in English departments hierarchies that can at times make the Vatican look rather freeform
The kind of left criticism that one encounters in Ross and Levinson and all through literary studies now is not in Marx s sense political
That is it does not concern itself with material but with ideological issues
Such criticism is I think open to the charges that Marx made in The German Ideology against the Young Hegelians Since the Young Hegelians consider conceptions consciousness to which they attribute an independent existence as the real chains of men
""
""
it is evident that the Young Hegelians have to fight only against these illusions of consciousness
Inevitably there will be a philosophical or conceptual dimension to any Marxist work
But Hannah Arendt was also right to say that Marx s impact on Western thinking derived in considerable part from his reversing the standard philosophical view that held the life of the mind to be superior to the life of action
From the Marxist perspective cultural criticism unattached to plans for material transformation counts as nothing better than an attempt characteristic of all idealist philosophies to solve the world rather than change it
At the point where one turns away from praxis as the cultural left in America largely has and tries to provide culture with some useful ethical and intellectual standards then even if the preferred terms are commonly associated with Marx the project is far more in the spirit of Arnold
It is also her determination to get a vocabulary in place that will help people to live better one that will also last
Arnoldian criticism has been accurately described as the process of making literature available to the uses of culture and that is what Ross and Levinson attempt to do
The best concise Romantic rebuttal is probably Blake s One Law for the Lion and Ox is Oppression
""
But why should Ross and Levinson and so many other critics in their thirties and early forties write in what comes down to an Arnoldian spirit Why does this generation of critics so clearly prefer truth to performance philosophical criticism to critical extravagance In his conception of Wordsworth and the Enlightenment Alan Bewell had something close to an ideal chance to write criticism that both praises invention and itself exemplifies the inventive drive
Bewell s learning enables him to see just where Wordsworth s poetry participates in Enlightenment anthropological discourse and by far the more important point where and how Wordsworth renews what the tradition gives what were in the writings of the philosophes abstract case studies of outcasts into narratives about human beings whose dignity is comparable to the poet s and the reader s
Thus Bewell sees Wordsworth s depiction of female isolates such as Goody Blake and the Mad Mother as revising the Enlightenment discourse on witchcraft rendering former objects of persecution in sympathetic ways and so enlarging the number of different kinds of persons that his readers can think of as part of the human community
And Bewell argues in these women Wordsworth finds images for his own imaginative workings
Bewell s Wordsworth is alive to the issue of gender and concerned to reform the class politics of his day though granted he is not in every way our contemporary
But to wish him so would imply as Julian Barnes s narrator says in Flaubert s Parrot a disturbing lack of selfconfidence The present wants both to patronize the past by adjudicating on its political acceptability and also to be flattered by it up the good work
""
Bewell s book is genuinely historicist work attempting to take Wordsworth in his own terms and to complicate our sense of his relation to the Enlightenment
The book shows what Wordsworth does for example to recast Enlightenment treatises on idiots on wild children and savages on the origins of religion on natural history on human attitudes toward death
In doing so Bewell is working in a mode eloquently commended by Milan Kundera in a recent Harpers essay Without criticism the discoveries effected by art go unnamed and thereby remain absent from the history of art for a work enters history and becomes visible there only if its discoveries its innovations are specified and recognized
Without the mediative background that is criticism works become isolated gestures ahistorical accidents soon forgotten
""
Bewell is a formidable scholar as one would have to be to undertake his task
Is it ungrateful then to observe that he gives us a rather enervated portrait of scholar a servant to the logic of the next step dutifully revising and revising His Wordsworth offers a critique of the Enlightenment a carefully worked out response to its practices and values
And often what is most surprising and moving in Wordsworth disappears in Bewell s book into carefully constructed intellectual history
For Wordsworth does nt just put forward an alternative to Enlightenment values as a politician might put forward a reform bill his poetry conveys the energy that could aid a reader who would transform and truly humanize the human sciences of his or her own day
The problem is naturally commonplace among comprehensive scholars like Bewell
Frequently the labor of learning required to speak accurately about where a writer actually departs from his or her context conditions the scholar s mind to the belief that all mental action must take the form of gradual unfolding
The scholar has trouble conceiving of a mind that works more swiftly and intuitively
Goethe is to the point Thought expands but lames action and
mates for the kind of criticism that Frost was endorsing not without selfinterest when he talked about how critics should take some pains to see what a feat it was to turn that that way and what a feat it was to remember that to be reminded of that by this
The perception of such feats is inseparable from authentic literary pleasure and that s tied up I think with the ability to delight in change to accept the fact of time s inevitable modifications of who and what we are collateral with the wish however futile to be imaginatively out ahead of time
Such literary pleasure which comes down to the pleasure in trope in the largest sense of that word is something for which Ross and Levinson and alas Bewell as well have little use
Pleasure has been in rather poor repute among academic students of literature for some time of course
In Lionel Trilling felt compelled to publish an essay in defense of literary Keats
Conceive the situation wherein the somber Trilling became pleasure s most prominent advocate among the critics
Since that time Foucault has forced US to ask if there is any form of pleasure available to human beings that has nt already been codified by the normative disciplines
Even erotic pleasure Foucault implies has been so extensively surveyed by the various discourses of knowledge that it can be neither innocent nor subversive
Rather than providing a release from the burdens of a determinate self sexual acts of however eccentric a sort may serve merely to consolidate the subject and thus reinforce powers dominion over him or her
A comparable suspicion of the pleasure principle seems pervasive in academic literary criticism at present and for a number of reasons
The story is frequently told of how Cleanth Brooks kept the English program at LSU alive by demonstrating to the dean with copious use of blackboard diagrams how the New Criticism he had helped to devise was a coherent cognitive discipline not unscientific at all branch of knowledge with a place among those other forms of knowing that make up the liberal arts curriculum
To thrive as a university discipline the study of literature had to look as serious as its competitors and if possible more so
The current rage to be interdisciplinary is a rage to get more terms on the blackboard to purloin if possible some respectability from the other departments
As each hungry new generation of critics treads its forerunners down new terms new abstractions get added to the game
And of course the quickest way to move out ahead of one s critical progenitors is to say that they have been mystified too soft too idealizing in their conception of literature
One thing that has certainly aided this process whereby to speak broadly philosophy has gotten the upper hand on poetry is the disappearance of a culture of informed literary journalism
Edmund Wilson for example was extremely good at challenging Brooks and Company s pretensions to scientific authority creditable journalistic counterweight has now disappeared in its place we have the angry muddled responses of a Hilton Kramer
To be maligned in The New Criterion is to a literary academic proof that his or her critique is hitting home
The makeup of the English departments has also changed significantly
Freelance critics like Blackmur Jarrell and Delmore Schwartz were eventually absorbed into university literature departments but their presence there effectively blurred the borders between the academy and the larger reading public
Now all the critics in the English department hold PhDs
Having been through the mill they have exclusive control of its engines
Such a shift helps set the scene for developing a professional culture well insulated from the public and possessing its own languages rites and hierarchies
Within that culture the pursuit of pure critical knowledge even if it is what Wordsworth feared knowledge purchased through the loss of power can go on largely unchanllenged
What other trends might be inspiring this critical recourse to more matter of institutional or professional politics it is very difficult to say
Trilling would probably have ascribed the phenomenon to a drive for negative transcendence
What s at stake as he sees it in getting beyond the pleasure principle is the hope of arriving at a position of superiority in culture a position from which having been liberated from every interest one might speak with complete detachment and therefore with complete authority
In a culture teeming with images that promise total bliss the total repudiation of all images and all pleasures is perhaps an understandable reaction
Then too energies that transcend individual designs might be in play
Hegel of course could conceive of a time when mankind would outgrow its need for art
Freud in his turn reflected on those happy few the scientists who had full access to the reality principle and did nt need their instruction gilded with delight
That scientific type might in time as Philip Rieff reflected become the norm even in its workings
Perhaps contemporary criticism with its polemic against esthetic pleasure is merely keeping pace with culture s overall movement or perhaps demystifying criticism is in cultures vanguard that anyway would explain its strong attractions to young and talented writers such as Ross and Levinson
And yet it was Wordsworth himself who spoke of the grand elementary principle of pleasure observing that it constitutes the native and naked dignity of man and that it is the principle by which a person knows and feels and lives and moves
In Wordsworth s poetry the principle of vital energy of pleasure was named Lucy and Margaret and the Winander Boy and it has restored and invigorated for nearly two hundred years
Wordsorth recognized a trend toward freezing abstraction in his own cultural moment but he did not see its triumph as inevitable and he set his own best poetry against it
Still there was something even in Wordsworth that feared the vital presence enough to kill around he succeeded in doing away with it for good and the sane and lifeless voice of Armytage comes on to infuse the poetry of the next fortyfive years
Armytage is an admirable personage stoical detached dutiful and morally beyond reproach
But by himself he is nothing like a genuine poet
Nor is he an ideal critic either
By MARK EDMUNDSON
The ENGLISH poet Craig Raine dedicated his recent book of essays Haydn and the Valve Trumpet to Karl Miller without whom English letters would be dramatically poorer in recognition of a lifetime s dedication to literature
Those who admire Millers critical writings elegant alert exceptionally toughminded as well as openminded will recognize the aptness of these words to a writer who has studiously avoided the limelight and has not always had the recognition he deserves
The sense in which English letters would be dramatically poorer without him includes of course his work as an editor an occupation in which distinction is specifically earned by avoiding the limelight
In the years through when he was successively Literary Editor of the Spectator and the New Statesman and shell Editor of the Listener Miller presided over a transformation of literary journalism that brought to the art of reviewing a new standard of exactitude responsibility and liveliness
It was during his time and at least partly under behind the homogenized anonymity of an Olympian house style which had provided a characteristic note of mandarin metropolitan reviewing in Britain began slowly but fairly surely to go out of business
This occurred not only in the journals he edited which for the most part needed the change less than some others
But the impact made by his earliest work as an editor remains vivid to me
I still remember from the late the conscious act which made me buy the Spectator not a paper I would normally have thought to read because of the quality of its review pages unstuffy wittily aggressive with a new forthrightness a freshness and independence of style and of thought
What struck me most was a quality of professionalism of decent scruple in matters of both fact and opinion without loss of readability
Among the reviewers to whom Miller gave a national forum were Frank Kermode and Christopher Ricks
He was especially good at enlisting the skills of professional academics among others to address a reading in expertise a feature now taken for granted in the best reviewing papers on both sides of the Atlantic and probably owing more to his early editorial work than it does to any other single person
For this alone he is a preeminent figure in the history of British literary journalism
As the founding Editor since and as CoEditor with MaryKay Wilmers since of the London Review of Books he has created what some think of as the liveliest intellectual paper in the Englishspeaking world
His new book Authors is variously linked with that paper
Many of the essays in it first appeared there and many of his critical exchanges whether agreeing or dissenting are with other contributors
That the chief impression this gives is not of narcissism but of a live traffic in opinion is an index of the qualities of personality and of mind both of the author and of the journal
There is in addition a concluding chapter entitled Literary Journalism which contains his reflections relations with that not exactly uneventful time
It began in at a time when the luxuriance of British bookreviewing had been trimmed by a lengthy strike at Times Newspapers
it began when Margaret Thatcher began her reign as Conservative prime minister and when the Social Democratic Party began and when the rule of the Ayatollah Khomeini began in the Middle East
There must have been those at the time who thought that none of the undertakings in question would last for very long
The SDP has since merged with the Liberals But Mrs Thatcher and Khomeini went on in their anger to dominate these ten years both of them holy terrors of a kind with an air at times of the interminable and the London Review is still appearing
The paper was launched during the year when the TLS the bestknown organ of highlevel bookreviewing in Britain and perhaps the only one at that time with a genuinely international reach was silenced by industrial action along with the Times and its been some dissatisfaction with the TLS which until the mids maintained the practice of anonymous reviewing by then widely felt to have outlived its time
The New York Review of Books had demonstrated that a market existed for a strong reviewing paper whose contributors announced their responsibility for what they said instead of losing themselves in or sheltering behind the pseudoimpartialities of faceless punditry
By the later John Gross had gradually introduced signed reviewing into the TLS and begun to make more extensive use of the long reviewessay at some cost to the rapid and wideranging coverage of very large numbers of literary and learned works which had been a special usefulness of that paper but with gains in readability character and accountability
These changes were under way at the time of the stoppage and they continued after it both under the editorship of Gross and that of his successor Jeremy Treglown
The TLS has since developed in ways which have I believe benefited from the stimulus and competition
When the London Review stepped into the vacuum created by the strike it bore very much stronger resemblances to the New York Review than the TLS ever did
These were not only matters of physical format and of general editorial conception long thinkpieces no short reviews
Many of the contributors wrote regularly for both papers and for a time if I remember rightly British subscribers to the one automatically received the other nestled within its bulky parent like a baby kangaroo in a pouch
The London Review still looks like a smaller or slimmed down version with fewer ads and some might think more disciplined wordage
One of the features of the New York Review which presumably had a special appeal for Miller was its assumption of a public with a serious interest in all forms of literature imaginative and learned m the life of intellect in a wide sense of the term a sense which especially includes politics not necessarily partisan but not necessarily nonpartisan either
In the great nineteenthcentury quarterlies on both sides of the Atlantic some of which survived into later times but as shadows of their former selves
A catholicity that includes politics in close and natural interaction with other matters of literary or cultural concern is amusingly reflected in Miller s insistence on Thatcher and Khomeini as presiding and monstrous presences in the inaugural decade of the London Review
It would be wrong to say that the blend of politics and intellect implied by this ideal was confined to the nineteenthcentury reviews and went out with them
Miller sees it as having survived on a reduced scale in a number of papers including the three earlier papers he worked for
My own experience of journalism has always lain in the field of small papers interested both in politics and in literature in the behaviour both of rulers and of authors and it is to this field that I am mainly referring when I use the term literary journalism
The three papers I worked for earlier were all of this kind of an ancient strain in British journalism a strain which preceded the arrival of masscirculation newspapers and assisted in their creation
This is to hark back to a time when there was a general knowledge which could be called by the name of literature and which a journal might hope to publish
Such papers are distinguished from the little magazine specializing in a branch or genre or faction of literature and eschewing politics
But they have in the nature of their presentday format and circulation been restricted in their scale of attention
Though committed to the range of interests Miller describes they have usually not been able to provide the space and context for extended pieces written with specialist excellence for readers who are not specialists and care about excellence
It s here that Miller looks back to the nineteenth century before specialists became an institution and when some authors wrote on many subjects with a specialist authority and in particular to the earliest of the great reviews closely associated as up
I ve suggested that what we do has been done in the past
At the start of the nineteenth century the Edinburgh Review embarked on an achievement which has not been forgotten ID literary journalism and to which the practice of the old New Statesman for instance was in certain ways intimately related Francis Jeffrey s journal Can be read and admired to this day for its earnestness and impudence its politics and letters its wide spread of subjects on either side of that division and for its argumentative long articles
These are features which have gone we d like to think to the making of the London Review
We have tried to make a hook of each issue which is indeed the length of a book and we have wanted to carry essays as opposed to notices and to be as sparing as we could with the irresponsibility of the opinionated and unsubstantiated short review
This is an approach which appeals to writers who want to make a book of their like a death warrant to many a working journalist
For good or ill books have already been made of articles in the paper collections by individual authors as well as anthologized selections
The world of the Edinburgh Review had already been evoked in Miller s first book his Cockburn s Millenium a study of the Scottish judge and man of letters Henry Cockburn who was a friend and biographer of Francis Jeffrey the editor of the Edinburgh
That book like the present one had a certain autobiographical dimension
It also shows an early stage of Miller s interest in manifestations of the double life a theme to which he devoted his next big book of Doubles and which remains pervasive in Authors in which Cockburn also makes a brief appearance or two
In some ways Authors is a sequel or at least a pendant to Doubles for example in its exploration of romance and restraint in Richardson and the memoirist commemorator of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu but here appearing mainly as the author of several other interesting biographical works of racial dualities particularly in a sharp and vivid study of V S Naipaul of the textual dualities of pastiche and the interactions of past and present and the psychic states they express or allegorize in the novels of Peter Ackroyd of similarities and reciprocities in the works of Kingsley Amis and Philip Larkin of Kingsley Amis and Martin Amis of Philip Roth and Saul Bellow and of the polymorphous Roth and his alter ego Zuckerman
In some of these discussions Miller focuses especially on the question of whether and in what ways biographical information contributes to the reading of novels and poems
The choice here may in a sense be one between knowing more and knowing less
Should Amis s friendship with Larkin which goes unstated in Amiss fiction but which is not absent from it matter to the reader of that fiction The report that Eliot to me it was only the relief of a personal and wholly insignificant grouse against life is no more a licence to treat the poem as totally and unreservedly autobiographical than it is a conclusive estimate of its significance
But the report is worth knowing by those who want to know the poem
This is typical Miller language flatly and with conviction addressing matters of inherent complexity or hot debate
It is conviction without dogmatism both firm and openminded refusing simplification and also refusing to be overwhelmed by the nonsimplicity of the issue
It underlies throughout this book the whole question of authors their presence or absence their relationship to their creations their responsibility for what they write
The case of Paul de Man comes up several times and we know where Miller stands but there are no cheap shots though specialists in the latter doing themselves too much honor will doubtless count this as one
In later life de Man was understood to he saying that not exist
And there are those now who appear to want to understand this as a way of saying that the author of over a hundred collaborationist articles did not exist
This comes in an essay actually entitled Authors which takes up the mythology of the death of tile author as itself answering to a cultural need a ploy that tries to outface the facts of an unexpended interest in authors
Authors are taken to be inspirer exalter disturbed excluded
They are absentminded awkward
Their huge wings prevent them from walking about
And they are caused determined deceived
According to Freud they are ill
According to Barthes dead
These are among the things that we have needed to think of authors and they have often appeared to indicate what authors undoubtedly suffer from in their effort and anxiety in their pursuit of tile imaginary
But they are things that are wrong and right with them peculiar to authors who have tended to place an undue trust in restrictive accounts of their activities
They have abdicated and abstained while also figuring on occasion as specialists in the restrictivegrandiose
Pseudonymity and its ironies often deeply political are part of the theme of Authors in particular the recent case of Rahila Khan a reclusive Asian woman whose book of stories dealing with generational conflicts within the Asian community in Britain was about to be published by Virago but was found to have been written by a leftwing feminist antiracist Anglican vicar called Toby Forward a real name which looks like a pseudonym
When Forward came forward according to Miller s account a Virago spokeswoman said he pretended to occupy a space that is nt his
""
""
apparently untouched by the thought that this is what novelists are meant to do and may even succeed in doing
Virago had a point which is nt altogether that pen names released me from the obligation of being what I seem to be so that I can write as I really am
This is what he means when he says Rahila Khan was me
Not everyone will follow Miller either when he says this may not be very different from what Flaubert meant when he said the same thing of himself and Madame Bovary since Madame Bovary was nt being presented as the author of the book
But one may salute the sarcasm which adds that the only harm that has been done is the bruise administered to the theory that authors are separate and do not matter
When his cover was blown Virago decided that the identity of their author mattered very much indeed and proceeded to make out that there was something the matter with him
Try the idea that authors are separate and do not matter on for example Salman Rushdie whose case risks putting the death of the author on a allow for and to whom Miller devotes some moving paragraphs
He then tells of an oldstyle critic he met when he first visited London one of the literary moralists then functioning as the profession s inspectorate who told him that Dylan Thomas who had been kind to Miller was a shit
Miller comments that the distinction between authors and critics is now rightly contested among literary theorists who believe that critics are authors and there are now few friends for the idea of a barely readable inspectorate which tells writers how to write and that they are shits
This if it is not all sarcasm may seem a shade optimistic
The barely readable inspectorate still rules OK though its words have become longer
There are sorts of authors whom Miller as a class finds it harder to take than others some of them trading authors the label is distilled from uppishnesses Miller has at various times discerned in the literary milieux of the eighteenth or less at one with other people and whom it can often seem that only a great willingness would be willing to worship a comment charged with the muffled deadliness of a lingeringly delayed Jamesian precision
Then there is Fernanda Eberstadt mentioned in Miller s moving and witty chapter on Primo Levi who in an essay in Commentary on this great writer and survivor of Auschwitz found him wanting in Jewishness but who elsewhere praised the antiSemitic Gustav Herling because he gave her a sense of a man talking to God whether or not she has talked to God Miller never one to underestimate the competition concludes she has certainly been reviewing for him
""
Miller is evidently inhabited by a Jamesian double
It has many voices
Here it is engaging with Barbara Everett herself no slouch at the convolutions of a refined indeterminacy and with her way of leaving
indefinite the point at which or frequency with which the use of biography deserves to this good thing this knowledge can be used to tell us for example that Amis is not a Tudor writer but she is rather more moved to say at the same time that it ca nt or can hardly be used devoted as she is to the thought of a separation between in this case Amis s friendships and politics his life and his art
Miller is an extraordinary stylist in the precise sense that his style is unlike anyone else s even where it plays at being like James s
He is a specialist highly selfaware of the spacious circumlocution in which leisurely abstract phrasings are harnessed to remarkable precisions delicately labored or suddenly curt
He also packs a great concentration into colloquial idioms of a sort flatter than James would normally use and he sometimes practices a dialect of thrusting indirection for which I know no analogues as when he writes on the indirections of journalists in the opening paragraph of a chapter on the Polish reporters go to foreign countries where there is trouble and collie back to write books in which they say that it was hard to make out what was going on
When they say this they are apt to be called writers
Writers do nt know what is going on
But they can be good at conveying what it was like for them to be there and to be writing it down
The journalists to whom I am referring can more solemnly be said to be practising a modern art of indirection of the unintelligible and the interminable
It is as if the war crisis living hell or chaotic backwater can never be known and will never end
After a while you fly out
It is a civilized oblique style with a bizarre precision of the unspecific both detached and engaged ironic and amusing but also with an unparaded fervor that expresses exactly that concern with the role of writing in human affairs politics which Miller describes as central to his all its understated elegance is not without shock tactics and which sometimes bites sharply and deep
This is a wise delightful book
It covers a wide range and anyone might pick small quarrels with its information or its manner
The story of Don Quixotes changing reputation from madman to for example sympathetic hero might have been enriched from Stuart Tave s The Amiable Humorist
Victorians did as Miller says object to Richardson s indecency but so did his own contemporaries including Fielding even as Richardson went on paying him a more conventional version of the same compliment
Some points usually verbal ones are made to do heavy duty and some linkages in the chain of argument or fact seem strenuously contrived
These are the small quarrels
I have no doubt that some will have large quarrels with this book and I take this to be to its credit
It combines the virtues of journalism and scholarship in the best senses of both and some liking
One or two have already said so
Books of essays other than by the inspectorate are by general report hard to sell
But if any is worth buying this is it
By CLAUDE RAWSON
Authors by Karl Miller Oxford University Press 
Since I ve lived in New York I ve liked walking avoiding subways or taxis whenever I can
These days I usually walk from my apartment in Greenwich Village up to midtown on the East Side to eat an amble about three miles long
There are plenty of restaurants in the Village but none quite like those just above the United Nations in the side streets of the Fifties
They are French but not fashionable food is still prepared with butter and lard and cream the patrons are bulky and comfortable the menu seldom changes
The restaurants are in the ground floors of townhouses and most are done up alike a bar in front leading to a long room lined with banquettes of red plush or red leather Sundaypainter oil paintings of provincial France hung in gold frames on the walls above the banquettes a kitchen tucked in the back
People say New York is a cold city and I suppose any one of these restaurants could be cited in middle age lack that air of reassuring familiarity tourists like
But the restaurants are filled with people seemingly quite content to be left alone many regular solitary clients as well as couples speaking quietly
To reach the French restaurants I have to pass from my house through a drug preserve just to the east of Washington Square
Ten years ago junkie used to sell to junkie in the square and the blocks east to Third Avenue
In the morning stoned men lay on park benches or in doorways they slept immobile under the influence of the drugs sometimes having spread newspapers out on the pavements as mattresses
It was then the sort of scene which might have attracted Baudelaire s spleen
In a prose poem of he described a poisoned group of workers
This languishing and pining population
""
""
who feel a purple and impetuous blood coursing through their veins and who cast a long sorrowladen look at the sunlight and shadows of the great parks
In Baudelaire s he encountered aggressive beggars and spontaneous fights his lapels were grabbed by men selling watches while his pockets were picked by men stealing them
These disorders stimulated his muse
The civilized man must somehow account for pain he can do nothing about
The dulled heroin addicts now are gone replaced by addictdealers in crack
The crack dealers are never still their arms are jerky they pace and pace
Baudelaire s inflamed poetic voice no longer conjures an observer s impression of their woe for the sight of these human beings whose bodies are shortcircuiting while disturbing is not too disturbing if I also keep moving
Along Third Avenue abruptly above Fourteenth Street there appear six blocks or so of white brick apartment houses built in the and on the edges of the Gramercy Park area the people who live here are buyers for department stores women who began in New York as secretaries and may or may not have become something more but kept at their in an American city drinking casually in bars alone or dining quietly with one another these women of a certain age women who did not attempt to disguise the crowsfeet at the edge of the eyes for generations the blocks here have been their shelter
It is a neighborhood also of single bald men in commerce and sales not at the top but walking confidently enough to the delis and tobacco stands lining Third
All the food sold in shops here is sold in small cans and single portions it is possible in the Korean groceries to buy half a lettuce
By modernity Baudelaire wrote I mean the ephemeral the fugitive the contingent the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable
Gramercy Park is a community of refugees like so many other places in New York but here there are refugees from the family
These are emphemeral lives one might say their daily rounds consisting of little bits of and feeding cats in the evening
Most of the imagery of anomie isolation and estrangement of the nineteenth century assumed that solitude was an urban affliction
The image of a mass of solitary middleaged people in characterless apartment buildings still might conjure a pathetic picture
Yet there are lots of people on the street in this swath of Third Avenue at all hours though hardly fashionable these blocks skirting Gramercy Park are in the companionable spirit of Constantin Guys
Here solitude seems to enhance the ordinary business of life
Unfortunately in a few minutes of walking this scene too has disappeared and now my walk takes an unexpected turn
In the middle Twenties between Third and Lexington is the equestrian center of New York where several stores sell saddles crops and western apparel
The clientele is varied polo players from the lusher suburbs Argentines people who ride in Central Park and then another group more delicate connoisseurs of harnesses crops and saddles
The middle Twenties plays to these leather fetishists bars in rundown townhouses with no signs and blackedout windows
What makes the middle Twenties distinct is that all the customers in the leather shops are served alike rudely
Saddles and whips are sold by harassed salesmen wrapped by clerks ostentatiously bored
Nor do the horsey matrons seem to care much where the men with careful eyes take their purchases no curiosity about the blackedout windows from behind which ooze the smells of beer lather and urine
This indifference sets the obsessed free
The first modern school of urbanists was established in the United States at the University of Chicago around the time of the First World War
These Chicago urbanists most notably Robert Park originally a journalist whose visual impressions of the city came from investigating crimes accidents fires and political demonstrations sought to understand the relation between the city as a place and as a moral order
People who were outsiders they first thought were likely to benefit from the the defective nor the genius has the same opportunity to develop his innate disposition in a small town that he invariably finds in a great city
Deviance was the freedom the city made possible
But a community of single middleaged women also deviates from the normal connection between family and community immigrants who barely speak the language of natives deviate so do political radicals so do blacks and hispanics
Were one to add up all the deviant populations in many big cities deviants would form the majority
Thus Park in his later writings like his younger colleague Louis Wirth moved away from conceiving of the city as a place permitting differences but rather as a place of differences generating them
Its moral order was the lack of a moral order which exercised hegemony over the city as a whole
And indeed these fragments enter into the life of every urbanite so that he acts out in Wirth s phrase a number of segmented to difference place to place activity to activity taking on the coloring of each scene like a chameleon
By virtue of his different interests arising out of different aspects of social life the individual acquires membership in widely divergent groups each of which function only with reference to a certain segment of his personality
The teacher of these Chicago urbanists the Berlin sociologist Georg Simmel had begun to influence his students through a famous lecture given in about defenses against the outside
Its title was Die Grossstadt und das Geistesleben which translates as The Great City and Spiritual Life
These men who were bred on reporting crime in the Chicago stockyards found writing about the spiritual life of cities slightly uncomfortable at least in the abstract manner in which their teacher conceived of it Individual Spirit struggling with Impersonal Collective Form
They sought a way to translate the spiritual life of the city into concrete facts
In part they substituted the word subjective inner life a little less highflying and more a matter of personal perception
But this did nt take them very far as social analysts
The word they found which seemed the key to making translation between the spiritual and the material was difference and in seizing upon this word they began to diverge from their teacher
Difference connoted to Park and Wirth experiences of otherness surprise and stimulation to be had in a city a person experiencing otherness will respond positively inside if only emphemerally by temporarily taking on the color of his or her surroundings
Vivid inner life occurs in the experience of these passages
The Chicago urbanists felt the urban dimension of this process to lie in particular in the facts of density population distributions boundaries between different populations centers where differences in population became overlaid in a compressed territory
By crowding human differences together the thick impasto of experience ought to give urban life its vitality
They did not imagine urban dwellers could define the complexity subjective awareness and vividness occur as individuals move between communities and come to accept human beings as partial provocations of one another
Thus did encounters with strangers life in a crowd explorations of difference all take on a positive value for these social researchers
Des Geistesleben life of the spirit translated into daily experience of impersonality
And in this the sociologists looked at industrial Chicago somewhat as Baudelaire had looked at the Paris of Louis Philippe nearly a century before the city offered in its concentration of diversity a milieu in which individuals could get outside of themselves turn their subjective lives outward
The smell of urine is perfumed if only I keep walking
In the upper Twenties bags of spices lie in ranks within the shops run by Indians and Pakistanis when the doors are open in spring and fall the combined scents waft out to the street but like most of the ethnic enclaves in New York these sensuous sights and smells are not few of the bags of spices are identified by labels
This brilliantly simple expedient discourages all but the most intrepid of tourists who upon asking for an explanation of the mysterious bags will be smilingly informed by perfectly polite shopkeepers that one is hot spice or another an imported ingredient
The shop owners stand in their doorways in summer making jokes or comments could it possibly be about us which their neighbors meet with the faintest parting of the lips the slight smiles which acknowledge more and perhaps condemn more than a loud laugh
New York should be the model city of the urbane dream it grasps the imagination because it is the city of difference par excellence a city collecting its population from all over the world
Yet it is here that the urbanity of the Parisian poet and the Chicago sociologists seems contravened their hope for a truly modern civilization which has not become reality
By walking in the middle of New York one is but precisely because these scenes are inward turning they seem unlikely to offer themselves as significant encounters in the sense of a vivid engagement a telling moment of talking or touching or connection
The leather fetishist and spice merchant are protected by disengagement the admirable women who have made lives for themselves near Gramercy Park are also disengaged not those needy sort of Americans who feel they must tell you the entire story of their lives in the next five minutes the junkies doing business are seldom in a mood to chat
All the more is this true more largely of the races who live segregated lives close together and of social classes who mix but do not socialize
A walk in New York reveals that difference from and indifference to others are a related unhappy pair of social realities
Differences do not interact
The city often reminds me of the neglected studio of a painter who has assembled all the paints books of other artists and sketches he will need and then unaccountably left town
The promise of urbanism as it appeared in the great industrial era remains unfulfilled
Instead of provoking engagement difference coexists with indifference
Here is one effect of personal space in which the outside is neutral and does not arouse
This coexistence of difference and indifference is most evident in the last lap of my walk which passes through Murray Hill
The townhouses here are dirty limestone or brownstone the apartment buildings have no imposing entrance lobbies
There is a uniform for unfashion in Murray Hill elderly women in black silk dresses and equally elderly men sporting pencilthin mustaches and Malacca canes their clothes visibly decades old
This is a quarter of the old elite in New York
The quarter likes to depict itself as a dying neighborhood aristocracy buried by loud men civility crushed in the hands of people who have the temerity of their vigor
In one way the manners of Murray Hill simply mirror those of the spice merchants a dealer in tumeric and the senior vicepresident of a bank at least brothers in silence
But old money has refined the display of indifference
The center of Murray Hill is the Morgan Library the library housed in the mansion at Thirtysixth and Madison of the capitalist whose vigor appalled old New York at the turn of the century
The talk at blacktie dinners here is dull the Morgan does not glitter
Some few of the men at Morgan Library dinners will go to the Century Association nearby for that sort of exercise or even further afield to the Grolier Club
The Century has chamber music concerts art exhibits and evening lectures at the Grolier there is bibliophile chat the dinners at the Morgan evoke the aura of civilized discourse without a taxing expenditure of thought
At the tables set under the library s dark oak beams dwarfed in the architectural volume of J P Morgan s swagger people speak cozily of children and of their friends divorces
Near the Morgan an enormous store regularly open in the evenings so that people could shop after a day of work
Often one would see women of the sort who live nearby in Gramercy Park shopping for sheets there the sheetshoppers had clipped the advertisement for a white sale out of the newspaper and carried it in their unscuffed calf handbags they were hardworking thrifty
I had as I say often seen them stop after a round of shopping to contemplate these other women in their unfashionable dresses and jewels in old settings the men in their worn dinner jackets entering the portals of the Morgan Library the doors opening and closing by the aid of flunkeys within so that those about to dine need not push
There is a moment of hostility on the street perhaps clouded in the shoppers eyes by surprise at how shabby are the permanently rich and then a slight shrug of the shoulders
In one way the negligence of the diners at the Morgan to their circumstances is thus mirrored at its between circumstance place and person there were only a neutral connection
The shoppers shrug accept and like me move on life will go on
This oil of the mechanism of indifference is not the machine of power itself
Instead the display of indifference is how the eye sees power at work in space
In walking the streets where people go about their own business we are constantly witnessing scenes of submission in which the actors think they are simply keeping to themselves numbed to the fact that true negligence requires a privileged place in society
Submission passes through power s magic lantern so that the image illuminated on the city s streets does not irritate the eye
Submission appears on the streets as detachment
If what one sees hurts one can always keep walking
To Tocqueville this would have been perfectly comprehensible
That shrug is a gesture of individualism
Now I ve sighted the restaurant
The East Forties between Lexington and First Avenues is the most anonymous area buildings in and out of which junior diplomats at the United Nations move their children and their chattel as governments at home rise and fall
Each month office towers encroach upon residential towers a marriage of towers in the sky that blot out the sun on the streets
On the periphery of the city one can see literally miles of burntout or abandoned ruins the buildings often with brickedup windows or windows covered in sheets of metal behind which at night one spies gleams of light this permissible belt of desolation in so rich a city is like a boast of civic indifference
Here in the very center the buildings especially at night have their own derelict homeless air the remaining townhouses more like provisional structures than dwellings a hundred years old as they are so obviously slated for the wrecker s ball
Perhaps the most profound conviction modern people have about modernity is that it is complex
The technology of the modern world is certainly more complex than that of any global becomes more multiangled
The era of the Isms at war capitalism nationalism socialism has ended and peace has produced a political map whose roads are too tangled for professional racers ever to follow
Complexity is our most cherished cliche
And yet to the extent this cliche tells a true story it has an unexpected denouement
Social economic and political complexities produce experiential withdrawal dissociation and lack of stimulation
Material complexity does not produce a culture of vividly felt difference
Difference fails to work subjectively
A complex society does not arouse an engaged inner life rather it erects a divide between social reality and personal reality
The social realist may attack politely the lady with her bag of sheets standing outside the Morgan Library imploring her to recognize what is really happening
But she feels he has attacked her that this social realism about the outside threatens something within her something which resists engagement
She has kept faith with herself
Faith social realist does not understand that this is why she resists his truth
In political studies the values of difference are expressed as the ideal of pluralism
Negotiations between the mosaic of different races classes and ethnic groups have been conceived under the banner of pluralism to knit the city together
Each interest group will give a little to gain a little the process of exchange will distribute the goods of government in bits to all
This was the liberal ideal of the American authors of the Federalist Papers in the eighteenth century and of libertarians like Tocqueville and Mill in the nineteenth
By now it is clear that these partial plural exchanges are much more likely to benefit politicians than their constituents some larger principle than the deal is necessary to cope in any decisive way with racism in schools income inequalities or crime
Pluralism however is more than a philosophy of deals
It implicates in countries like the United States or Great Britain the value of differences continuing to persist after immigrants have settled
More largely it supposes that a society will draw life from the diversity it contains that the exercise of human rights for instance will become meaningful to a society when these rights are accorded to groups of people radically unlike another rather than simply privileges which apply to people who are pretty much the same
Right acquires its weight by being able to cross the boundaries of different customs sexual preferences or religious beliefs
The Chicago urbanists had a clear idea of how in a city differences should hold people together
They imagined the city to be like a magnetic field in which each class race religion ethnic group occupation sex preference and age was a molecule all these charged differences held together in a dynamic tension within the field
But if difference loses its reality its charge its energy then this field of forces will not hold
If a Jew does not care to understand no serious effort to negotiate their hostile differences between them are only the possibilities for trivial accommodations
The liberal pluralistic ideal which was a simple and noble ideal even as it was corrupt political practice supposed that people could take one another as seriously when they diverged as when they converged
This seriousness bound them together
But what if these very differences make a faint impress Then the force of rights is weakened the gravity of the right to free speech is weakened if the mind can not conceive what this right would mean equally for Catholics Moslems and Jews for Fascists Communists and Liberals for educated people who speak clearly and uneducated people struggling for words
This is why the values of personal space are urgent politically because they depoliticize the mentality of people not by advertising or easy manipulation but rather by creating a complex and unhappy subjective life which is so much richer than the emotional universe envisioned by liberalism so much more compelling
Even Guys Baudelaire also conceived this annulment of difference
Guys was a dandy stimulated by differences
Baudelaire saw other men on the streets figures who in the midst of the noise and jostling seemed wrapped up unhappily in themselves
From contemporary America he drew an arresting image of these figures wandering Paris they seemed like Indians of the American forests and plains wandering among the camps and towns of the white settlers
The differences the Indians encountered the engines boxes of processed food and manufactured clothes did not arouse them rather they found the spectacle depressing
Here were evidences that they were a doomed race
And Baudelaire thought these Indians became more uncertain passing among the signs of modernity that anything within them could hold up against this world their rites their cosmologies had less command over the world than a box of processed food
They turned ever more within themselves the members of the doomed race in ever greater uncertainty about their own spiritual life and with thought similar tribes could be seen everyday on the rue de Rivoli disguised in white skins velveteen jackets and top hats
We need to find in modern culture some secular form for the valuemaking human capacities religion once channeled
Without this discovery we are indeed like Baudelaire s doomed Indians lacking the energy to resist the neutralizing forces of domination
And it is only through a spiritual life that transpires without the assurances threats ancl governances of gods that a social ideal like pluralism could ever make sense an ideal in wllich difference itself is valued in which complexity becomes life
The writing of graffiti literally scratchings can be seen on manmade brick walls as old as those in Hierakonopolis from around BC Word graffiti have traditionally taken two forms
One is doggerel like that seen in urinals more or less amusing more or less obscene but where the message is easily understood
The other form of wallwriting is secretsafe in public
The siKns a place is secretsafe writing a chalk square means a place is risky or a cross within a circle that you will be given food by these people
Prison graffiti are made more elaborate by the compound effect of so many prisoners writing on the same wall decade after decade
In his prison diaries from the Second World War Victor Serge noted that
The walls speak
To the careful eye every surface reveals signs
""
""
scratched in with a pin or in dark corners in thin pencil lines R is as if the throllgs of men thrown together by prison needed only thirty words and a phallic symbol to express the essence of the suffering in their lives
At first glance the cell is empty silent sepulchral
But after the first five minutes every square inch of wall or floor has its tale of woe to tell
""
""
""
You soon grow tired
""
""
tired of the constant repetition of the same miseries
The place and read his wall no matter it is in extremis that he writes these crude impersonal signs
In one way the word graffiti done by slum kids in New York beginning in the S broke radically with the wall writing that had come before it
There was nothing discrete or covert about it as both tramp and prison graffiti were nor was it done in private places like urinals
Huge numbers initials and nicknames identifying the writer appeared inside and outside subway cars insignia made with cans of pressurized spray paint and felttipped pens
Neither obscene nor political as in the S posters just names written everywhere
The scale of this graffiti was what at first made the impression so much of it and so much of it was big covering doors and windows and bench backs and metal plates of subway cars the functional parts of these walls ignored all covered over as surface on which to write
From the walls of subway cars the names and the fixed walls were similarly appropriated
These endless or monster labels might be rather grandly described as the making of a theatrical wall the subway cars treated as a neutral backcloth to be brought to life by dramatic gestures in paint
The kids were indifferent however to the general public playing to themselves ignoring the presence of other people using or enclosed in their space
There is a great deal of ponderous writing about this graffiti as an art of the oppressed and the critical hype tends to lose touch with what these kids were doing declaring who they were on objects which were then repainted scrubbed or broken up so that the declarations disappeared
These were aggressive crude juvenile marks of this is me met by adult hostility
Spraying graffiti in paint or scrawling it in marking ink across the walls and the subway cars of New York was treated from the first as a crime
The kids also treated it as criminal activity
It quickly wrote to steal their cans of paint and markers
Many of the materials then became illegal
For instance a marking pen with a twoinch wide brush was the first tool kids used to write their street names or identifying numbers on moving or stationary walls it was quickly taken off the legitimate artsupply market as was its successor a pen with a halfinch felt tip
To do larger forms of writing either thrownups a few giant letters on the outside of subway cars or pieces anything from cartoon characters to depictions of one s entire family the writers used cans of pressurized spray paint
Eventually the manufacturers changed the design of the spray paint can to prohibit the drawing of thick lines making antique spray cans another valuable commodity on the black market
Crime gave to both sides a little electric charge This is real
As the paints and pens became criminalized so was entry into the yards where subway trains are stored
of New York strewn with glass and beer cans home to drifters who pried open the doors to sleep and shelter to young people who had no place to go to make love
Some of these yards were Ollt in the open at the edge of the city but others were subterranean beneath the city s center like the storage pit under the Brooklyn Bridge where at three in the morning you could smell sausages cooking over the fires the drifters built at the edge of the tracks and hear over the sound of the crackling occasional sex moans frorll other cars but almost nothing from above the hustling suits on Wall Street still asleep far away
When graffiti came the yards were gradually closed up with fences at one point the police used specially trained dogs who patrolled the yards prowling back and forth between a double fence but now the everhungry expensive dogs are gone like the drifters and the lovers without beds the trains are enclosed in fencing topped medieval wall these at last protect the urban instruments of speed from writing
These graffiti were innocent of obscene messages or political messages or indeed any message save one fecit I did this this mark is me I exist
In their form usually numbers like or CamCam II they were impersonal signs but applied everywhere these marks seemed to capture the space for their makers
Why have the surfaces defaced with these impersonalpersonal declarations so disturbed others
Here is one honest answer
I am a subway rider and while I do not find myself consciously making the connection between the graffitimakers and the criminals who occasionally rob rape and assault passengers the sense that all are part of one world of uncontrollable predators seems inescapable
Even if the graffitists are the least dangerous of these their everpresent markings serve to persuade the passenger that indeed the subway is a dangerous place
""
""
""
the issue of controlling graffiti is
The reason people are afraid of graffiti on this account is that it is a writing of the underclass we exist and we are everywhere
Moreover you others are nothing we write all over you
Inside a subway riders have a good ride when nothing happens no crazies singing no beggars everyone lost amid the dirt and noise in the safety of their own thoughts
A New York subway car is a rueful and extreme instance of the dictum that urban differences are tolerable so long as they do not interact
It would seem that the crime of graffiti was to force others to respond to the presence of the juvenile underclass declaring itself
But graffiti reveal something more than the aggression needed to make others notice
These marks have a message I exist written in a peculiar way
This peculiarity becomes evident in how New York graffiti contrasted to those of Paris at the same period which were more truly impersonal
The to nineteenthcentury edicts forbidding political posters
The last time there was a concerted effort to prosecute the scrawlers of slogans on walls was during the Nazi occupation of the city
An ever less draconian guarding of urban surface during the last halfcentury has gone handinhand with ever more orderly and restrained acts of defacement
The simplest difference between New York and Parisian graffiti of the Great Graffiti Era the S was that there is so much more graffiti in New York
Paris graffiti of the S were usually made by stenciling an image or slogan is cut out from the center of a piece of cardboard the board is pressed against a wall while the image is spraypainted on
Since the most ordinary materials are used just as they come from the manufacturer there is no way to criminalize them
Even so the public in Paris as well as the authorities was not aroused by the appearance of these graffiti despite the fact that the slogans were frequently politically provocative and the images occasionally sexually the difference
Stencils create images which are both small in size and clear in detail
The wall surface thus becomes a background against which the image stands out unlike graffiti in New York which cover over the wall space
Indeed recent graffiti on the streets around the Bastille have been carefully positioned on the walls and different graffitimakers avoided jostling one another s territory
In this part of Paris political posters are still common but the groups making use of them now mostly African and Iranian have also taken care not to trespass on the framing space around the graffiti
These stencilled images appear mostly on fixed walls and are meant to last to become geographic to be absorbed into the fabric of the city
Whereas in New York graffiti the moment a tag or piece is smudged or altered the rules of the game permit other graffiti writers to write over covering it with their own marks an opportunity which is seized whenever it arises and which accounts of New York
The Parisian graffiti incorporate the wall as part of what s to be seen distinctly as framing space the New York graffiti obliterate it
The pleasure of graffiti is compulsive that of repeating the same image over and over again in different places one feels more powerful the more places one sees one s mark
Some of the Paris graffiti thus are as widespread as CamCam or in New York but the marks of identity in Paris are seldom names
The stenciled images are of things an insect repeated over and over sometimes on the same wall so it seems to swarm a banana transformed into a long face wearing sunglasses with the caption Speedy Banana next to it
On the walls of the new opera house at the Bastille are already repeated stencils of razor blades to remind passersby of the guillotine and the revolutionary past here
The French graffiti writer makes his presence known by an image which does not name him
Unlike Parisian graffiti its surface it declares the maker rather than reveals him through a mediation it makes the instant act of declaration all a name moving everywhere rapidly
Identity becomes publicity
It moves and it can not last
To a fourteenyearold boy whose gang had succeeded in painting an entire train with their names interlaced with cartoon characters the act of selfdeclaration feels like this
There s a park at Simon Street where it makes a turn and there s a big avenue there Westchester Avenue
People were all crowded up there in front of the stores and they were looking up at the train and going Wow You could see the reflection in the windows of the slums of the cars all painted
Every car was like a TV and you could see the colors reflected
""
""
""
The next day I went to Brooklyn Bridge and I thought This thing has to be together
At least five cars
But they were all broken up
One with a Mono car and I said wow split up already oh my lod Every piece was on different trains
It was crazy
""
""
but that had been the greatest moment
""
""
that I d ever had
The creator of Speedy Banana created an amusing decorative object
The creator of this train of names did more and less
There is a pathos genuine if juvenile in his effort to declare himself
The train of names reads to others as garbage
The marks of identity are rendered in such a way that they soon become an impasto of writeover mess or fragments of faces and broken names traveling at random on the hundreds of miles of subway tracks until scrubbed off so much effort which has only produced more disorder more meaningless aggression in a city in which for people obliged to ride subways order is precarious and the random rules all these signs of self traveling without sense
urbanites who are obliged to press themselves upon others in a place without a hierarchy of established recognitions
Who counts who even exists these are matters which are established in cities by effort an effort usually involving struggle a struggle mobilizing aggression
In a way what the shim boys did to subways men in suits do every day in offices making their impress upon others the victories lasting only until the next bid for attention the hustling concentrated in a place in which so many people unknown to one another know they are mutually contending
This was Baudelaire s Paris it now is modern New York
It is what endless becoming means in crowds there is a constant struggle for recognition which degenerates into aggression
In a city there is no smallscale rooted village existence which frames who people are the streets are filled with strangers prepared to resist rather than accept
Moreover the very signs of identity degenerate in our city
Difference is a word which contains information as when I pass the spice shop and think That s how an Indian spice merchant lives in New York
But this information is not neutral
The merchant may say to his twelveyearold son who is fillingspilling for me a paper bag of tumeric How many times do I have to tell you to go slowly In hearing this universal litany of fatherhood chanted again suddenly I might feel the presence of the father and the son and perhaps the Indian who has smiled at my questions and pushed me away by answering imported ingredient if now he notices me noticing might be moved by my existence as well it occurs when our eyes meet after looking at bag and boy
What would complete our relation in this silence is a kind of mutual recognition which has occurred across the barrier of difference
At the end of the Pherwmerology of the Spirit Hegel made the connection between difference and recognition the key to ethics
Recognizing reconciliation between contending egos it is the yes with which both egos desist from their existence in opposition
This sentence could have been the preface to a famous exhibition of photographs mounted a generation ago called The Family of Man in which African farmers Hong Kong merchants English aristocrats and American adolescents are all shown going about the basic businesses of life working and making love and playing and caring for children which unite them in one human family
It might seem that the recognition which passes between the spice merchant and me means that we realize that we too are both members of this family of man both fathers if fathering in different ways
Were however I to announce to the Indian at this moment We are both fathers I would perhaps earn another of his faint smiles or his son would perhaps earn another scowl the family was losing face in the presence of a stranger
And similarly were I to accost wrapped to reassure him that though I did nt share his tastes I accepted them as just part of the human condition he might wrest his eyes from the thongs nestling in tissue paper to glance at me in alarm perhaps I was a cop trying a new form of entrapment in order to arrest him
If not what right had I to name his desire aloud The lady carrying a bag of sheets might disturb the lady entering the Morgan Library more by remaining and staring not by calling out which could be dismissed as just vulgar rudeness
If only their eyes could lock those of the privileged woman would surely drop in embarrassment first
A recognition would have passed between them but belonging to the same family of man would hardly be for them a matter of affirmative uplift
The ethics of recognition are knotted up the way pluralism is tied in a knot how to affirm the reality of difference among strangers
The smarmy message of the family of the end none of us are strangers to each other
The family of man is like conceiving a global Personal Space
How instead might recognitions forge a social bond between people who may be necessarily hostile to one another or who do not talk the same language or ca nt understand one another though they use the same words or simply have a right to silence An easy way to cut this knot seems to be simply to affirm the value of mutual toleration and be done with it
And yet as some of the graffiti writers were to find toleration has its own peculiarities in the modern world
In The Faith of Graffiti a glossy picture book of New York graffiti Norman Mailer having assigned himself the graffiti name of A in the course of interviewing a selected group of street artists roundly declares for them all that graffiti is the herald of some oncoming apocalypse less and less far away
The art galleries were began to seize upon this graffiti as art almost as soon as it appeared by the New York art dealer Sidney Janis could mount a PostGraffiti Art exhibition at his gallery filled with painting done by a few subway artists who had found their way from car walls to canvas
Money filled the opening of this show money dressed down in leather jackets and jeans while the artists dressed up kids in shiny suits circulating among the canapes treated with shy respect by the Janis buyers and with something bordering on paternal alarm by the black servants passing food and drink
In the catalogue of this show there is a photograph of Keith Haring a young white artist who adapted graffiti writing to a tamer scribbling which can decorate posters and Tshirts as well as canvas
In the photo he is wearing one of these massproduced Keith Haring Tshirts
Next to him is a dark Puerto Rican young man wearing nothing but a cross on a string and a pair of boxer shorts his nipples Ortiz widely known on the subways as LA II
Just as the clothed white artist is advertising his clothes so the nakedness of the slum Hispanic is an advertisement
Behind them is a collaborative painting
Beneath them is Haring s guarantee that the buyers at the Sidney Janis Gallery are looking at something of value a statement dated printed in italics under the photo
Because he possesses qualities that are uniquely human the image maker in the history of man may be more important now than at any other time
Human imagination can not be programmed by a computer
LA II s imagination is our greatest hope for survival
LA II is looking down at this announcement
He seems to be studying it
The packaging of an identity like all advertising inflates the value of the human commodity it contains
Graffiti is ideal for these purposes LA II s aggression against bourgeois propriety certifies he has made something significant that he has made a
Almost all the shows of graffiti art in the early eighties in New York were laced in the gallery spaces by words explaining the signs many of the signs themselves had become so familiar to people in the city that without the texts there might have been the danger of gallerygoers assuming that for some reason the kids after wrecking the subways were going now for the inside of buildings
The gallery world s hot reaction to graffiti if seeming at least so much more sympathetic than the policedogs patrolling the subway yards between double fences revealed however another way of policing identity one which annulled the sting of its difference
The honest subway rider s confession of his everpresent sense of fear in the presence of graffiti is reversed in the assertion that the street artist is the herald of some oncoming apocalypse less and less far away
The fear is reversed so that now the attack seems something to be desired so that the naked LA s imagination is of the gallery owner s name Sidney Janis was providential
From threatening faces the poor can be made to show another face
Instead of appearing as criminals failures or losers they are transmuted into moral superiors
There is reversal peripeteia and there is the ritual work of purge
LA II s identity is given a new value the value is of a messenger of doom to be sure but what matters is that the message no longer belongs to him
He has been interpreted
Understanding what he means an understanding writ larger than his life becomes the way of taking him over
In taking him over his understanders relieve themselves of his threat they draw closer to him closer and surer of step
LA II and his kind harbingers of an apocalypse less and less far away though they may be have been domesticated and are now ready for consumption
Thus can toleration be caught up in the process of the interest of graffiti as an extreme case is that they show that toleration can revalue the hostility of protest so that it becomes part of the dominant order s endless debate with itself about its own legitimacy
Money can be made in this debate
Yet even in the most juvenile forms of graffiti there is more than the sheer effort to attract attention
There are signs of effort to contrive an expression to make a name in colors to make a traveling train of names to make a form and all this is more than a matter of sheer aggression or crying Recognize me notice me I am here
Melvin Samuels Jr
whose only statement about his work is that graffiti should be amusing was a member of the Death Squad writing group in the South Bronx and signed himself as NOC 
Born in he began exhibiting at the age of New York Amsterdam case of the bourgeois world s need to exhibitown those who are its negation
In his case however painting proceeded despite commodification
In paintings like The Letter exhibited in Munich in at the Galerie Thomas NOC created a painting which makes use of calligraphy like the letters on the subway cars of New York but is truly postgraffiti
The sprayed edges in yellow and pink of this canvas create a living wall of color the magic marker lines and spraying in brown and green on this wall are imagined in terms of color contrast the blackmarker writing itself carefully positioned within a field of yellow
The writing itself is two fragments both in quotation marks one the letter announces the title of the painting the other is dreams of the holocust sic so unexpected a phrase nestling on its pretty background of ochre
One searches the painting to know why it is here finds a halfburied brown swastika in a jutting this artist who says graffiti should only amuse means what he has written means that this puzzle could be a dream of the Holocaust all that slick color questioned by the writing
The viewer believes in him far more than in Norman Mailer
There are actually three writings on NOC S painting not two
The third is his signature but it is easy to miss discretely placed at the lower right
And in the photo of Keith Haring with LA II the Puerto Rican boy whose eyes are cast down a little as if he might just have read the caption beneath him looks dubious
Perhaps like NOC he is instead curious about the living wall of paint
It would be the artist s resolution good form takes an artist out of himself the form becomes its own reality
By RICHARD SENNETT
V S Naipaul and I have perhaps two things in common but they might disqualify us from making either a critique of the South or a critique of a critique of it we were born and reared in Trinidad in the West Indies and we have only a limited knowledge of the South
He left Trinidad at eighteen I at twenty two
His knowledge of the South is restricted to a visit to a presidential convention in Dallas in and another visit of about four months which forms the basis of his book A Turn in the South
My knowledge is derived mainly from having lived from to in Charlottesville Virginia and from observing the South since then as an Americanist living elsewhere in the country who has become an American which includes taking on or accepting my portion of the burden of the national history
In other words Naipaul and I both know almost nothing about the South so my observations here will be much more in the South is the product of a tour that apparently lasted from midApril until August preceded by a brief Easter visit in which he traveled from New York to North Carolina
The tour took him to Atlanta Charleston Tallahassee Tuskegee Alabama Jackson Mississippi Nashville and then to Durham North Carolina
The end of the journey in Charlottesville Virginia is relegated to a brief dismissive coda but one that gives more than a hint of the book s main theme
There was history there in quantity Naipaul writes of Charlottesville Jefferson Monticello the University of Virginia
But that was history as celebration the history of the resort the history that was causing the subdivisions or housing developments to multiply
""
""
and was even threatening the fox hunt
""
By this point it is clear that the search for the meaning of Southern history has been the book s main theme and although there are subsidiary interests Naipaul s search for Southern meaning
To this central theme or search three other major themes or searches themselves interconnected are related the respective places of religion politics and art in Southern culture
One may well ask at once whether a travel book is an appropriate place for an investigation into the heart of a region
In some respects travel writing is a shallow form of serious literature the only form in which ignorance is pure bliss
W E B Du Bois once wrote scornfully perhaps quoting someone about car window sociologists who view their human subjects mainly from a comfortable distance then write about them with confidence and no doubt consequence
No matter how long he or she lingers in any one place filling notebooks or tape cassettes the travel writer must surely be most often a car window sociologist a car window psychologist and a car window writer however plentiful or intimate are the interviews or chats with members of the native mine not Naipaul s
Travel writing occupies a major place in his body of work as Robert Nixon points out in his important forthcoming study of Naipaul s travel books
Naipaul is highly conscious of its tradition which in English includes Trollope Conrad and Graham Greene and of his own place in that tradition
Almost half of his twenty or so books are nonfictional and mainly involve travel although he had set out in the beginning to be a writer of fiction
Why did he shift In part he has lamented the fatal loss of the power of the novel
In spite of the undoubted success of his magisterial A House for Mr Biswas and other splendid early work like the stories in Miguel Street and the novels The Mystic Masseur and The Suffrage of Elvira Naipaul has decided that the novel as a form no longer carries conviction
At some point in his career he came to the realization that he could not be as he admits a
that my response to the world could be expressed equally imaginatively in nonfiction in journalism and I take my journalism extremely seriously because think it s a very fair response to my world
It s something that ca nt be converted into fiction
His journalism has been of the higher kind
Early on Robert Nixon notes he refused to talk about assignments from editors instead he spoke of his missions to foreign countries
Mission is a term from diplomacy or religion and yet Naipaul s missions mainly to the Third World have seldom been diplomatic and if they could be called religious then inquisition more than conversion or redemption has been his discernible goal
Among his travel books A Turn in the South is particularly rich in autobiographical references that involve his early years in Trinidad
It casts valuable light on some of the main factors that made necessary this shift on Naipaul s part from short stories and novels to books of cultural commentary or missions much a mission as a ramble something at once elegant and considered casual and lighthearted something appropriately to the South cavalier
Nevertheless this inquiry into the American South has to be seen along side Naipaul s other travel books which have been mainly about India Africa and the British Caribbean the darkest element of the Third World in more ways than one
Does Naipaul see the South as a part of the Heart of Darkness which it is his mission to illuminate Such an identification of the South might seem improbable until one recalls the recent uproar in West Virginia about a California travel agency which offering tours of the Appalachian region promised thrilling visits to America s Third World
The package has since been withdrawn
In the old days of segregation and lynch law the South was primitive primeval Gothic grotesque
With the integration of the last lunch counter the stowing away of the last lynch rope the dismantling of has become well almost boring or hardly more Gothic than the rest of the country
Naipaul understands this point remarking of the United States in general that it is not and can not be alien in the simple way an African country is alien
It is too well known too photographed too written about and being more organized and less informal it is not so open to casual inspection
And yet the South clearly remains special for him and to him and for the reason it seems to me that it does represent some additional illumination of his larger mission to the Third World
The point may be underscored by Naipaul s announcement here that this is his last travel book travel on a theme
""
The question remains how Naipaul is able to see the South as part of the problem of the Third World how his reflections on his tour of the region could have assisted in furthering the basic inquiry that had previously taken him America
After all in spite of the black capture of mayoralties here and there notably in Atlanta and Memphis and more recently of the governorship of Virginia the South is still dominated by whites and its religion is overwhelmingly Protestant
It seems an unlikely place for Naipaul to try out those theories concerning the nature of Third World cultures that are implicit and even explicit in books such as An Area of Darkness The Overcrowded Barracoon India A Wounded Civilization and Among the Believers books incidentally that have made him a disliked and even reviled figure among Third World intellectuals
In prize conscious Britain where honors abound there is hardly an important award open to writers of prose that he has not won but in many parts of the Third World Naipaul is probably only slightly more welcome than Salman Rushdie would be if he dropped in one afternoon for cocktails at the Iranian embassy in London
At a literary conference several years ago in his own West Indies so intense that one man publicly offered to shoot him
More recently however he has received an award which in his reaction to it casts light on our reading of A Turn in the South
I refer not to his knighting by Queen Elizabeth II but to his receiving the Trinity Cross his island s highest honor
This honor was not expected
The pride most Trinidadians had once felt in reading of Naipaul s successes had long since turned into anger even to hatred of him for his criticism of their society in books such as The Mimic Men and Guerillas which utterly rejected the local versions of Black Power
Some time after the announcement of the award Naipaul received the medal in person in Trinidad and it is said with no more than his usual show of discomfort
He also ventured to express particular satisfaction that the news of the Trinity Cross award had come before the announcement of his knighthood and is even said to have remarked that the Trinity softening if that is what it is is very recent as I have said and for most of his critics in the West Indies and elsewhere it could not begin to undo the three decades of insult he has heaped on people of color around the world
Nevertheless although in a heavily camouflaged way this softening is a crucial aspect of A Turn in the South
Given his reputation as a critic of black culture the book starts off in a highly unlikely way with Naipaul journeying into the South in the company of two black Americans a designer and lettering artist and his assistant Howard for an Easter visit to Howard s home
The idea that Howard believes that he has a home is itself central to the journey for he has surprised both his employer and Naipaul with his response to his boss s question Howard if I had to give up and you could nt get another job what would you do Howard had replied Naipaul writes
Jimmy the employer was as struck by this as I was when Jimmy told me that Howard had something neither Jimmy nor I had a patch of the earth he thought of as home absolutely his
And that was where many months after I had heard this story I thought I should begin this book about the South with the home that Howard had
This sense of wonder at Howard s confidence about home introduces from the start a central element in Naipaul s identity as a writer his own sense of homelessness
Out of this feeling evolved much of his career as a writer of nonfiction as well as important aspects of his career in fiction
He is a man without a home in his native Trinidad although most of his family are still there
Early on Naipaul once denied to a BBC reporter that he had ever visited Trinidad much less lived there
He has also steadily maintained that he is a man without a true home in or less since 
It has been strongly suggested by some of Naipaul s critics that this professed sense of homelessness is merely the most essential piece of his professional costume and that it is perverse for anyone so intimately connected to England by education marriage and professional success to pretend that he is not at home there
Such critics of Naipaul see his alleged homelessness as meant only still further to court white metropolitans
Underlying it all they see a profound sense of shame flattering to his English hosts at his lowly unEnglish origins his light brown unEnglish skin his unEnglish names Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul
This may be the case but only I suspect in some roundabout way that is insensitive to Naipaul s state of mind
The sense of gloom is too pervasive in his work the whoops of joy too few when so much success should have led willynilly to at least a few whoops however discreet
I hope you are not woman tells Naipaul when she hears that he is writing a book about the South showing that she does nt know that his most characteristic work is virtually all gloom
Pleasure itself is suspect where writing is concerned pleasure and writing appear to be opposed
I began to be aware of the great pleasure I had taken in traveling in the South Naipaul cautions at one point
Romance a glow of hopefulness and freedom had already begun to touch the early stages of the journey
""
""
""
I had all but forgotten the writing anxieties I had had And I thought that afternoon that it would have completed my plea sure if I did nt have to write anything
""
""
if I could simply be with the experience
This almost professional commitment to joylessness reinforces my conviction that Naipaul s sense of homelessness is real enough it also reinforces my sense that there is a deep connection between his homelessness and what has happened to his writing
What Naipaul s home in North Carolina is that Howard s claim to a home is in fact unfounded
It is not simply that there is a meanness about the small town from which he comes it is that every important institution on which the concept of home depends proves to be contingent fragile and doomed
The congregation of a black church where Naipaul goes to observe the service surprises and even temporarily pleases him
He is surprised at the formality of the service and in the idea of community reflected in it
A woman in white with a white hat got up and sang he remembers
So I began to feel the pleasures of the religious meeting the pleasures of brotherhood union formality ritual clothes music all combining to create a possibility of ecstasy
But such pleasure evaporates swiftly
It can not hide the fact that the economic base of this community is tenuous and dependent on the desires of whites
Howard s house the jobs the church even the cemetery all these factors bear for black people the unmistakable mark of foreclosure
And in an intimately related way the black past is also foreclosed
No one can go back more than two generations before reaching that point where darkness fell the historical darkness even here which was home
""
In this instance as in some others Naipaul concedes a crucial similarity between his black subjects and himself
He too although of the Brahmin caste in Hinduism can not go back more than two generations before losing the past Certain things are lost the way for me the grandson of immigrants from India to Trinidad ancestors as close as grandparents are mysterious and some unknown making it impossible to give a good answer after just a hundred years to a question like Where did your people come from His link to his family s past in India however humble that indentured servitude that brought Indians to Trinidad in the second half of the nineteenth century to work in cane fields that the former slaves now disdained
His grandparents arrived in the New World the spine of their history broken to attempt a new life in a place where as Naipaul tells us most eloquently perhaps in The Loss of El Dorado which traces the history of Trinidad from Columbus to the end of slavery nothing happened
Nothing happened because with the abolition of slavery in the British abandoned the colonies in spite of a continuing colonial administration as the course of empire led elsewhere
The Caribbean became a backwater
Growing up in this backwater Naipaul tells us here his greatest terror was of falling into nonentity
At that point in his book he associates this fear with his later feeling of taint and spiritual annihilation at seeing the human results of the swamping of East Indian culture in Martinique and Belize by nonIndian cultural values say for Naipaul no values at all
These lost Indians were New World debris
And it is out of this fear of nonentity that he derived his desire to be a writer to avoid the ninetofive job in an office and to be my own man
Ironically the humane and seriocomic fiction set in Trinidad on which he founded his literary career was set in this place where nothing happened and was all about people who from the metropolitan centers of Europe must have looked very much like the same New World debris from whom he elsewhere recoils
The turning point in his career came apparently when according to his judgment quoted at the start of this essay the novel as a form failed him or when the people failed him as it would seem from all of his later books or perhaps when he failed them
A Turn in the South suggests that Naipaul himself may be beginning to address moving not with all deliberate speed as his critics might prefer but deliberately nevertheless
He concedes a point of similarity between himself and Howard s community in the foreclosure of their sense of the past and he concedes too his surprise at the formality and sense of community in the black church
But he concedes little else by way of sympathy here
One would have to be quite susceptible to politeness or to Naipaul s craftsmanship in which stylized politeness plays a decisive role not to see the hostile picture of the black Southern world that emerges from A Turn in the South
The truth is that virtually all the major reviewers of this book including such towering professional historians as Eugene Genovese and C Vann Woodward apparently have been so susceptible
They have praised the book without important reservation and none at all on the matter of its depiction of blacks
For my part I would hardly wish to dispute the accuracy of Naipaul s depiction of the thinness of Howard s defensiveness spikiness he likes to say of almost all of the black politicians and other public figures he encounters
But Naipaul goes further in this book so that in spite of its apparent casualness of technique its alleged dependence on accident and impulse which leads him at one point to abandon plans to visit Faulkner country in Oxford Mississippi in favor of a pilgrimage to the birthplace of Elvis in Tupelo it is a highly crafted work and no way more so than in the manner in which it systematically attacks the black South
Of his basic technique in this book of travel travel on a theme two analogies offered by Naipaul himself need to be considered
There are some film directors he remarks who prefer to work in natural light the light that s available the light they find
And travel of the sort I was doing travel on a theme depends on accidents the books read on a To travel in the way I was doing he writes was like painting in acrylic or fresco things set quickly
The whole shape of a section of the narrative can be determined by some chance meeting some phrase heard or devised
If I had met someone else my thoughts might have worked differently though I might at the end have arrived at the same general feeling about the place I was in
These comparisons will not survive close inspection
There is a sense in which all writing is by available light and all written words are acrylic rather than compliant oils
The process of writing editing and publishing a travel book however is surely much more deliberate than these analogies imply and Naipaul s editing hand is visible everywhere in this book to the trained eye
As an example there is a kind of second brief prologue to his sustained plunge into the South when he describes a visit to Harlem
Both events in more In this visit one sees the mixture of what is weak and what is strong in his travel writing as well as what is accidental and what is probably purposeful what is unconscious and what may very well be quite conscious as the travel writer applies the putatively inconsiderate acrylic of his words to the page
He visits someone he calls only Al Murray who is described merely as a writer
This writer older than I had thought about seventy from hearing his voice on the telephone lives in an apartment full of books a serious collection and records
He is enthusiastic about jazz about writing about life
Indeed he was a man of enthusiasms easy to be with easy to listen to
His life seemed to have been a series of happy discoveries
Al Murray is proud of having attended Tuskegee Institute founded against the odds in the nineteenth century by Booker T Washington
Naipaul an achievement by now a place of tragedy and illusion
It exists he writes in a melancholy time warp
It made one think of the prisons of the spirit men create for themselves and for others so overpowering so much part of the way things appear to have to be and then abruptly with a little shift so insubstantial
Al Murray is proud of his apartment which is at the very end of a central windowless corridor that becomes uncomfortably warmer from fluorescent lights as one moves through it
Al Murray likes the building and likes the idea that a waiter at his club downtown the venerable Century Club a fact Naipaul does not mention is a neighbor here he also liked the apartment for its own sake
And Al Murray loves Harlem the streets of which have demoralized Naipaul who sees Harlem as a whole section of a great city like the war ruins preserved in parts of East Berlin as a memorial and certain ravaged streets of Harlem did make one think of war
Al Murray also has apparently no family an old man in an apartment with his books and records and his enthusiasms
""
This is indeed a restrained polite representation of Harlem
But the failure even once to grant Al Murray the name that appears on the title page of his books the failure to mention his novel Train Whistle Guitar or his collection of essays The OmniAmericans allows Naipaul to depict Albert Murray surely one of the more gifted contemporary thinkers about American culture as a mere curiosity odd frantic irrational and unproductive a writer who probably does nt really write and certainly does not publish seriously
Albert Murray may indeed fit some of these descriptions I do nt know the man but to read A Turn in the South from start to finish is the initial stages of the book as a key to Naipaul s dismissal not simply of the intellectual lives but also the artistic and the spiritual lives of AfricanAmericans
Later Naipaul will also disparage William Du Bois and his classic The Souls of Black Folk
It deals he writes in tears and rage it offers no program
By contrast the white writers he invokes liberal or racist are said to be creative Anne Rivers Siddons Eudora Welty Shelby Foote D E Huger Smith H R Sass James Applewhite and much more often than not we are given the names of their books and even now and then quotations from them
Indeed the book ends with four lines of verse by Applewhite
White men of the cloth notably Will Campbell reflect on the complexities of theology and social change
White songwriters are compared to Proust as is Bob McDill of Nashville whose countryandwestern lyrics are quoted at length revelation to him of what is called red neck culture I felt that I had been taken through country music to an understanding of a whole distinctive culture something I had never imagined existing in the United States
""
There are to be sure black believers in God and even blacks who show up on time for their appointments with Naipaul
However to read A Turn in the South is to be left with the distinct impression that there are no black poets or novelists in the South that there is no cultural counterpart among blacks to the red neck culture that so excites and inspires him that jazz and the blues the foundation ironically of the British revolution in popular music of the last thirty years also either do not exist or are so insignificant compared to white country music a ludicrous proposition possible only to a man as ignorant of mass culture as Naipaul proudly is that they need not be mentioned its scope that no black can be really interesting on the weighty questions of religious belief and social change
Blacks are contaminated it would seem by their sense of injustice
About the Atlanta politician Marvin Arrington I felt soon that there was nothing new for me to ask that all the points I might raise would founder on the subject of black disadvantage
""
Perhaps a line on the second page of the book gives us a clue to Naipaul s attitude toward blacks We saw the seedlings being mechanically planted one black man on the tractor two men on the trolley behind
In one place at least he is frank It was my wish in Mississippi to consider things from the white point of view as far as that was possible for me
Why he should want to do so why he should want to ignore the black point of view is not altogether clear
Surely it has something to do with Mississippi Up the Congo one does not interview the natives
It is as if the blacks of Mississippi really give Naipaul no choice
Jackson where blacks are concerned is depicted as a place of irrationality and violence or of religious ecstasies that could only be witnessed almost as an anthropologist might
The music and the singing held us the dancing held us we could marvel at the religious dedication he writes of a religious crusade
But we could only be witnesses we could nt participate
In a racially mixed society he tells us here after reflecting on an aspect of Trinidad life in his youth
distinctions and differences can have the force of taboos
""
""
""
Participation is different from witness they engage different sides of the person
And so it was with oldrelief that I put an end to my pleasure in the singing and dancing
""
""
and returned to the silent healing of the airconditioned room of the Ramada Renaissance in of black irrationality impotence and shabbiness is a creature who materializes in Jackson after a nasty young black politician plays a big or little joke on Naipaul Naipaul himself ca nt decide which carefully making appointments with him that are never kept and were never intended to be kept
The creature offers himself as a corrective to the hostile politician
He said he was black and he wanted to introduce me to the real black culture Naipaul remembers of their first telephone conversation
In the end after wasting Naipaul s time and behaving in bizarre ways the man invites Naipaul to take off his jacket to relax and let me show you how the blacks really live
I will take you to certain places
You will get the smell of corruption
I understood then putting things together Naipaul concludes that he was nt speaking metaphorically
The line of development that had begun with his grandfather was ending with him his own little world in
So too it would seem with black American culture in general which is apparently doomed to extinction
One remembers the assumption among many prominent white social scientists at the turn of the century that blacks were destined to disappear as a race in America mainly because of disease and immorality
This is an old way to see blacks in the South
The term Southerner means white as the novelist Charles Chesnutt lamented as long ago as in his novel The Marrow of Tradition blacks are of the South but they are not Southerners
Consider in this respect the courteous Anne Siddons in this book speaking about her fellow whites We were a conquered and occupied people the only people in the United States to be like that as if blacks had not been conquered and occupied in ways the white South could never have imagined for itself
This assumption remains dominant even in literary criticism and literary history about the South
What is unusual though hardly perfectly the prevailing attitude of whites toward blacks
Naipaul s view of one Southern city epitomizes his general view of the two main races of the South
The city is Memphis where Naipaul is aware of the sourness of things there with the black city an extensive irretrievable desolation and with the white people under siege living far to the east
The image is precise black culture as hopeless desolation white culture as embattled endangered under siege
Besieged by what By that factor or force so prominent in Naipaul s Third World writing the bush the primitive beginning to which the Third World is destined to return and is returning as Western civilization withdraws
In one respect Naipaul may have taken a revisionist step
In the tradition of the cultivated Englishman he has chosen to see the entire New World as a sort of mishap but scarcely because of slavery or the havoc wreaked on native cultures
Rather he writes in the spirit of the Buffon Reynal Joseph Mandrillon and Condorcet among others
America in this view has had a deleterious effect on the unity and deep meaning of European culture
One is also reminded in this special context this fear of the bush in the South of the enormous claim embedded in the Fugitive intellectual tradition and enunciated in I ll Take My Stand and A Gathering of Fugitives that white Southerners were in fact the last Europeans
They were connected to the perfection of Europe in the Middle Ages by the facts of history and by the harmony and beauty of the agrarian tradition which had been no more harmonious and beautiful than in the plantation system with its hierarchy that found slaves at the bottom the aristoi at the top and sweet religion everywhere
As Allen Tate put it in I ll Take My Stand
The South could be ignorant of Europe because it was Europe that is to say the South had taken root in a native soil
use for the intellectual agility required to define its position
Its position was selfsufficient and selfevident it was European where the New England position was selfconscious and colonial
So we begin to sense more surely why Naipaul has come to the South
He is indeed on a mission a sort of pilgrimage to sacred ground where blood of which the Civil War was a mere token had been spilled immemorially for the preservation of a certain feeling about history religion and identity that Naipaul considers and who would argue with him to be the essence of civilization
Allen Tate again on religion the South and the Civil War The South would not have been defeated had it possessed a sufficient faith in its own kind of God The setback of the war was of itself a very trivial one
For Naipaul the Civil War and slavery itself there are many allusions to both in this book were only painful episodes in the constant struggle preserve itself
When you think of the way the race issue has developed Naipaul asks Jack Leland a South Carolina aristocrat do you feel sometimes that slavery was a calamity for the South To which Leland with his seaman s chests from Barbados precious in the family since the penates of history has the grace to reply Slavery was a calamity
Most important for Naipaul in viewing Southern history is not the fact of white enslavement of blacks or white rebellion in the name of that cause but the enduring desire of Southern whites to live with reverence for their past to which reverence their feelings about politics art and even religion are related but distinctly subservient
What appears to be the truth or the accuracy of history in the final analysis is far less important than that the history be cherished
Men need history Naipaul writes in The Enigma of Arrival after listening to an East Indian man mangling the known facts it helps them to have an idea of who they are
But history like sanctity can reside in the heart it is enough that there is something there
""
Now this approach to history is a piece of irrationality and at the heart of A Turn in the South is the conviction that we whoever this we is must effect a truce with irrationality in order to live
The Truce with Irrationality is in fact the title of two large sections of the book and could easily have served as its title
Certain early words of James Baldwin about the necessity for him as a Negro to effect some kind of truce with this reality have stayed with Naipaul for the thirty years since he first read them
Naipaul s main discovery in the South seems to have been about the coiled relationship between reality and the irrational
The South is offered here as a dynamic site for the investigation of of the possibility of civilization s truce with the full irrationality of the world
One may be disappointed by the supposition that this irrationality is founded in large part on the unhappy interpenetration of white and nonwhite cultures but at the very least A Turn in the South offers an illumination of history and society while revealing Naipaul s expanded sense of and respect for the irrational
What he has seen above all with the South as his laboratory is the extent to which its people need the irrationality of history and the irrationality of religion and of art and politics to sustain them especially when so much of their lives is being threatened by powerful possibly irresistible forces
Though the unavoidable conclusion is that Naipaul concerns himself here almost exclusively with white people his book nevertheless throws light on black and white alike and on the human condition just as Faulkner s Absalom Absalorn severely limited as it is in its concern for blacks manages to illuminate black as well as and the lust for power in America and in the world generally
I would hesitate to declare that Naipaul has finally acquired toward the end of his life a new understanding and respect for Pragmatism here in America where it serves as a sort of official philosophy
And yet I am reminded apropos of the South and the Fugitive Tradition of a similar pragmatist turn by one of the leaders of the Fugitive group Robert Penn Warren
More than a decade after I ll Take My Stand the regenerate Warren meditated on Southern culture its history religion politics and identity in preparation for his novel All the Kings Men and later admitted that behind that revisionist narrative stood not only Dante Machiavelli and Huey Long but also the scholarly and benign figure of William James
The philosopher of the pragmatic method the reconciler of religion and science in works such as The Will to Believe and Varzeties of Religious Experience as well as Pragmatism had absolutism of the Fugitives by suggesting the fundamental terms of our modern truce with irrationality
Although Naipaul devotes several interviews and several pages to the truce with the irrational in the context of politics it is clear that he has little interest in that subject and even less in politicians
Politics in America now looks like a game of numbers with blacks poised to take over but meanwhile bringing mainly their rage and incompetence to the process
Up to a point Naipaul understands this response
Blacks had lived through too much the irrationality of slavery and the years after slavery had made many irrational and selfdestructive
The collapse of black institutions was the final cruelty of slavery that now at what should have been a time of possibility a significant portion of black people should find themselves without the supports of faith and community evolved during the last hundred years or more
Endangered the whites endure
Naipaul is interested more in religion than in politics
He concedes that religion religion caresses comforts stabilizes
In the South one can see identity as religion religion as identity
For many whites especially in places like Charleston with a particularly studied sense of history one finds a curious kinship the idea of the past as religion
On the whole the ethical sense is high even unsurpassed In no other part of the world had I found people so driven by the idea of good behavior and the good religious life
And that was true for black and white
""
Nevertheless in this book art plays a part even more important than religion
The work is carefully structured so that the figure of a poet James Applewhite of North Carolina becomes the apotheosis of the Southern willtocivilization
Applewhite dominates the end of the book in precise counterpoint to the antic figure of black Al Murray of Harlem in the beginning
Art hallows creates makes one see Naipaul declares
the importance of art for the book s own dramatic purposes there is a certain panache in ending with a poet and quoting his lines in conclusion
But how much does Naipaul value Southern art He is respectful of the finest writer he meets Eudora Welty without even hinting that he has ever read her work
Something is seriously awry however when the rival today to the Virgin Mary who inspired the grandest cathedrals of Europe is Elvis Presley
Not even the Fugitives thought that the art of the South such as it was rivaled Mont St Michel and Chartres and the other triumphs of medieval European culture
Facing a poster that shows Elvis and a staircase leading to his mother and to his mansion Graceland Naipaul reads it thus religious art of a kind with Christian borrowings the beatification of the central figure with all his sexuality Graceland like a version of New Jerusalem in a medieval Doomsday painting
""
I would guess that Naipaul gives his interest in the art of the region than because of the selfinvestigation that he conducts in this place that reminds him so much of his Caribbean origins even as he works hard to conceal that selfinvestigation
The major question here is not about the art that the South has produced and is producing as in Welty or Applewhite s work it is about the possibilities of art under the terms of a truce with irrationality and especially when that irrationality terrifies the artist into homelessness and silence or journalism
In writing about Applewhite Naipaul is writing about himself
One of his major discoveries in this tour is the close historical connection in earlier centuries between the trifling islands of his birth and some powerful centers of American culture notably Charleston and Philadelphia
Astonished Naipaul thinks he hears the distinctive accent of the speech of Barbados among blacks around Charleston Strange tiny Barbados finding an echo in grand South Carolina But then he reflects that the little island had been the Franklin s Autobiography to which North Americans sometimes ran away to try their fortune not as to the frontier but as to a city
He discovers too that the same little island was the model for the South Carolina plantation colony
The islands still cut a bright figure in the memory of the aristocrats of the South who kept harking back to the colonial British West Indies as to a mark of blood and ancestry
Toughminded as ever Naipaul squashes any idea that something is to be made of this Caribbean of the golden past
Perhaps he offers there can not truly be said to be an aristocracy in a place that came to nothing they are just people like Robinson Crusoe who went to the wrong place
Whereas Charleston was claimed by the large events of a continental history and its smalltime beginnings are now indescribably romantic
""
What the islands once meant was not completely unknown to Naipaul whose earlier The the region s history but here vividly contextualized by the extant glory of Charleston it takes on a new significance
Apart from his first travel book The Middle Passage which is about the West Indies Naipaul has never been closer to home in his travel writing
I mean home in the literal sense and also in the sense of his own ending
With the death of his younger sister in Trinidad and the premature death in London of his younger brother Shiva Naipaul also a novelist travel writer and harsh critic of the Third World and with his own accumulation of years a change has come over him
He writes movingly in The Enigma of Arrival of the occasion of the funeral of his sister It forced us to look on death
It forced me to face the death I had been contemplating at night in my sleep it fitted a real grief where melancholy had created a vacancy as if to prepare me for the moment
It showed men the grief and the glory
Naipaul has become more concerned than ever with his Trinidad family and its past and with the memory of his father to whom A Turn in the South is dedicated In ever renewed homage
""
Both senses of the term home I think are implicated in the fact that his many references to Trinidad prompt him to make connections not simply between the island and the South but between his personal past and the Southern landscape that compels his recollections
About home his personal past two insights appear near the end of the book to dominate Naipaul s thinking
For him what lends a peculiar force to these two startling insights or ideas is that they are quietly expressed by the poet Applewhite whom he meets in Durham
Of the first insight he says He Applewhite could nt have known how directly he was speaking to me
Of the second It was extraordinary
Not only as had happened more than expressing things I had felt as a child and an adolescent in Trinidad
He was alsothough he was from the other side of the tracks talking like Howard the black assistant whose home Naipaul visits at the start of the book
The first insight shared with Naipaul is that there was no landscape like the first that one knew
The second shared with Naipaul and Howard is a feeling parallel to the feeling of being at home in a particular place where one was born and has lived of being also a stranger there
Applewhite had spoken of the sensation of being so utterly at home in and a part of a place that one feels somehow coextensive with the place
But On the other hand there is a sense of separateness in being in part of myself an observing stranger in my own native land
To the extent that at times I was fascinated by the idea of the preexistence of Howard had said
I felt different at the high school
It s what you think and what you feel that makes you different
I always felt different
Which leads me to believe I was born in the wrong town
Like many people
""
Naipaul knew at once that these two sentiments reflect primary intuitions of his own
But his response to the tension between a feeling of home and a feeling of estrangement from that home is quite different from that of Applewhite or Howard
They love and feel attached to their homes in spite of often feeling alien to it or even having moved away
Applewhite goes one step further and makes poetry out of both his love of home and his distance from it
Growing up his sense of difference had been strong My feeling of duality at that time was being physically in the world I identified with but which on the other hand completely left out a whole other side of my psyche or my soul
He like it how it could be pigheaded and can cherish ignorance
It can cherish the unreasonable the unreasoning
Nevertheless there had been his mysterious desire to know to have the right to be aware or to name in language in harmonious language or in music to name things or else simply to name
Art he concludes is a sort of divine uselessness
""
Art too is irrational
Applewhite has met one kind of irrationality with another that is superior or divine
Out of loyalty to his original landscape and his capacity to distance himself without surrendering to alienation he has evolved an art of the place North Carolina his family s land tobacco fields pig sticking tobacco curing as in his Ode to a Chinaberry Tree with its poems about the farmland its crops its animals its people
These poems Naipaul discovers on the spot as it were may be a reflection of art s divine uselessness in Applewhite s own phrase but like Robert Frost s poetry it is about human beings doing making working with their hands
Such reconciliation is impossible for Naipaul whose triumph is that he has made an art not of his place but of his displacement
For him an art of the West Indian place has become impossible
For one thing his original landscape unlike Applewhite s is gone
What remains is only the scarcely bearable idea of the beginning of things now existing only in my heart no longer existing physically in the ravaged repopulated Trinidad of today
""
To me this is one of the most memorable lines in Naipaul
The idea that his Trinidad origins may be lodged in his heart is a revelation we had long thought Trinidad expunged from that place altogether
In its own way the thought is as new and startling as the image of himself that Naipaul presents at heroic black woman minister tells him of her days of civil rights protest in the S
Long before the coming of Martin Luther King Jr
and his righteous armies she and others including white Quakers had tried to integrate lunch counters in Washington DC and had been spat upon and humiliated
The story proved too much for her interviewer
Naipaul wept
The scarcely bearable idea of the beginning of things on the one hand and on the other his sister s death fitting a real grief where melancholy had created a vacancy these are virtual admissions on Naipaul s part of what he has been too proud East Indianproud one might say in a Trinidadian context to admit before how much he had loved that first landscape Trinidad out of which had come his earlier and most memorable short stories and novels
They are admissions too it seems to me of how much at this point in a reconciliation with that original landscape a token of which was his gracious acceptance of the Trinity Cross but also an admission of how deeply almost unforgivably Trinidad had wounded him as a child and youth
How did Trinidad wound him Not simply I think in the sense of the hurt that any society can inflict on a sensitive young artist
The hurt was rather more specific in the everpresent campaign of humiliation and demoralization and threats of violence aimed at Indians that he would have encountered as a youth in the capital Port of Spain in the late S
He lived there after leaving his home in the country to attend high school at Queen s Royal College from which he departed after winning a state scholarship to England in 
I do not want to leave the impression that East Indians were not for their part hostile to AfroTrinidadians
However they were a minority and their normal hostility took a different far less physical form where few Indians lived
This aspect of Naipaul s life has received virtually no treatment by critics except for Selwyn Cudjoe in his V S Naipaul A Materialist Reading
Instead in part out of ignorance the emphasis in discussing Naipaul and race has been overwhelmingly on his selfhatred and his hatred of fellow nonwhites
However it is no more possible to understand Naipaul s mind and art without reference to racism violence and intolerance in Trinidad than to understand Richard Wright without reference to the same factors in the South
The resemblance of Naipaul to Wright has never been noted as far as I know and may cause Naipaul some discomfort but it may well be that Wright and not Conrad Trollope or Greene Wright with his black skin and humble Mississippi origins comes closest to being Naipaul s literary and cultural antecedent
Like Naipaul Wright was an exile from a home countrythe South of blacks and whites which he not only hated but firmly In his autobiography Black Boy he denounced his fellow black Southerners as no other black writer and few whites had ever done how timid our joy how bare our traditions how hollow our memories how lacking we were in those intangible sentiments that bind man to man and how shallow was even our despair
Renouncing the South which he saw as made up of two primitive cultures black and white he headed north and then to Europe to be reborn as a believer in civilization which he identified aggressively with the West
Wright too had early success in writing fiction then clearly succumbed to the sense that the novel no longer to paraphrase Naipaul carried conviction
He continued to try to force out books such as his roman a these The Outsider or the very poor psychological novel Savage Holiday which contained no black characters at all
But like Naipaul he turned to travel writing in order to express himself Black Power Pagan Spain about the hopelessly primitive nature of that country and The Color Curtain about the Bandung conference of and the Third World it more or less announced and about which Wright was quite suspicious
Blocked in fiction Wright vented his despairing allegiance to creative art in hundreds of haiku penned in his later years and left behind unpublished
What these two men have in common is not at root shame about blackness in one case or about being East Indian in the other
It is rather a genuine sense of having been wounded by their own and a genuine sense of homelessness linked to a despairing love of home
And while art commonly flourishes out of the tension between a sense of belonging and a sense of alienation it grows only fitfully out of such radical alienation and demoralization as they felt such despair and melancholy
For writers affected thus a secondary art is possible travel writing critical essays or an art of nihilism
Almost impossible are works the original beloved landscape of one s desire or the dynamics of love and belonging
What I believe Naipaul has discovered late in his life in his personal encounter with the conflict between death as true grief on the one hand and chronic melancholy or depression on the other is something about the dignity of the irrational and the necessity of making not peace with it which is impossible but a truce
Out of this truce art and what passes for peace in human affairs may perhaps come
He has come closer to home even as he awaits passage to his final home
By ARNOLD RAMPERSAD
I had been asked by an editor for an account of my experience of being interviewed by V S Naipaul but the fragmentary piece had foundered upon the single discrepancy between my memory of what we had said and done and the version represented in A Turn in the South
There Mr Naipaul had described as from inside it a graveyard in the fields across from the farmhouse of the Applewhite family a fenced plot holding the marker stones of paternal ancestors including a Civil War veteran and his father
Yet we had not actually entered that space with its boundary of rusting iron and its weathering inscriptions
The accuracy of his portrayal was founded upon his visits to many other similar spots and on my version of this one in particular
It was while hearing a lecture by Arnold Rampersad on Mr Naipaul s personal stake in this book that I began to conceive explanations which made this event more interesting and possibly intelligible
Mr Naipaul and I had met I had driven him him a tobacco field and he had had tea with my wife and son and me at our home on Seven Mile Creek
I had been painstakingly questioned in two sessions at the Carolina Inn in Chapel Hill the base of Mr Naipaul s operations in the area
But then he had proposed that I drive him to my home in Stantonsburg in eastern North Carolina and what is known as the fluecured tobacco district to see the family farm which is still operated by my father
With some misgivings I agreed
Perhaps I feared that the farming culture and tobaccorituals as I had recounted them would not sufficiently agree with presentday realities
But the chance to spend more time with this man of such tremendous comprehension and humanity was irresistible
And as it turned out the trip went very well
Mr Naipaul was not disappointed in the Civil War era Applewhite farmhouse nor in Dee Crimes who lives there currently and farms for my father
Mr Naipaul felt that the landscapes of the than diminished by the originals he saw around him
And though no tobacco was being put in on our farm that day a family friend Dan Whitley was operating his mechanical harvester a few hundred yards up the road
The visit went exactly as presented in Mr Naipaul s narrative in A Turn in the South until almost the end
It is that slight disjunction between what I remember happening and what he wrote that I am here attempting to explain to myself
To do that I must recount some of the earlier conversation between us
The question of Mr Naipaul s that had come back to me during Arnold Rampersad s lecture was deceptively simple
He had asked whether I had ever felt lost in that earlier eastern Carolina world of my boyhood
I had told him of the size of my town its population of about a thousand and of these people s fierce preoccupation with the pragmatics of planting cropping grading and selling
And we suggest an incipient cultural selfawareness in the folkways I remembered
He seized with emphatic interest upon my account of the typical farmwife s sweeping of the bare yard of the farmhouse under the shade oaks with dogwood saplings bound into a broom leaving orderly scratches in the sandy clay
That had been in the days before power mowers and the lawns they made feasible
He remembered seeing similar lines inscribed by sweeping in the yards of African villages and associated these with Japanese gardens and their raked gravel
He was pleased with my descriptions of the wrapping of cured and graded tobacco into bunches called hands and their regular placement in squared piles on the auctionhouse floor
He seemed to be moved by my assertion that tobacco growing in its best handcrafted aspect as I remembered it had been a kind of folk art
I felt that we were both hungry for signs of some reach after expressiveness and meaningful order in this landscape gloated over by humidity and heat and by the pressure of of my sense of the pathos surrounding the rituals of food and drink as I remembered them
I said it seemed that the food had always to be overdone the iced tea too sweet to make up for some inadequacy some impoverishment
Ah yes he said in the poorest areas of India things are also too sweet
It is to reassure themselves that they have enough that the people do this he said
I felt that he knew and felt more of deprivation than he was revealing
This was when he asked if I d ever felt lost in the South
I told him that I had felt lost
I recalled for him the strange blazing outerworld which for many months after I d been said to have rheumatic fever shut me up with books by Zane Gray and Jack London and Edgar Rice Burroughs
I told him of my melancholy sense that the world in these books had seemed so much more authentic at times than the world I walked wise could explain to myself
I said that Tarzan of the Apes had come to seem especially representative
Apparently I d conflated the novel and the earlier movies so that for me Tarzan was inserted into the jungle and given over to the great apes and their gesturelanguage and life of heroic physicality by a plane crash rather than by a shipwreck
At any rate I described how at times I d felt my psyche as if suddenly introduced into a tropical factcentric world like young Tarzan s separated from the cultural base of his ancestors origins
As the more recent movie Greystoke so vividly dramatizes the young Lord is heir to a not unimpressive English patrimony
I had no doubt taken surrogate satisfaction in both Tarzan s ability to adapt completely to life in the jungle and in his actually having an English parentage
I felt that I often failed to master the expected physical skills and hardihoods of that farming community and that the other realm the hinted progenitorculture and its implied higher level a series of hints and guesses
Halfjokingly I told him that when I d discovered Plato and Plotinus Tarzan s plane crash had come to seem a lot like the traumatic descent of the soul into matter
I d felt crashlanded from some deja vu prior existence among kindly but inarticulate apes
I d come trailing clouds of nostalgia for names explanations and understandings everything from sex to the constellations to the correct names of trees
I d felt that nothing had been explained that I d been hugged to the bodies of people called family with only a terribly poignant love and need for them sharpened by the impossibility of any adequate speaking between us
My heromodels in the novels even were men of few words men who rode the prairies or trekked the North with wolves or swung through treetops who let their actions speak for them
And I had not been very good at actions and had desperately wanted to learn to speak
As I sighed
The idea of growing up in some vacancy of knowledge seemed intimately familiar to him
I felt that he had been hurt by an analogous location in brute fact and ignorance and then hurt again by the loss of that place
I knew from my own experience though I could not then say it that the nostalgia with which we are bound to a first soil may be proportional to the pain it has given us by its strangeness and recalcitrance
The paradox for me was that this place which had seemed at first so utterly opposed to my emotional hungers and instinct for knowledge had come to be the language of my poetry
The hard stings had gone in and had been changed by time into the things I praised and elegized
Mr Naipaul was apparently fascinated by the particularity the localism the rootedness of my background and experiences as I was by the multinational scope and extensiveness of his
I envied him the many analogies and the context of knowledge through which he he envied me my continued location in so historically definite and inescapable a site
He said I had an audience that was my own
I reminded him that much of the civilized world formed his readership
He seemed to take a very melancholy view of that broad slice of the world I evoked
Too abstract too problematic too little particularized in place to be depended on I understood him to say
He had been in a strange fashion deprived of a single homeland by the events of his parentage and life
Perhaps that is why in his quintessential tact and gentleness despite his fierce intelligence and need to know all particulars all concrete exempla he held back with me there short of the family graveyard
For me consciously the wish not to go on was not deeply felt
Perhaps I was tired perhaps I feared it would disappoint
I thought at the time that V S Naipaul held back out of a kind of reverence for a reverence he fear that the simple stones and the names of my great great grandfather and great grandfather and of their brothers and wives would not live up to the description I had given him driving down
Perhaps in the declining light the letters would not be legible
Now however I believe we may have held back by intuitive conspiracy to defer the overwhelmingly personal relation between myself and those graves so that for a while longer that concrete rectangle of history could belong also to him
And so that he in his articulate consciousness could belong to me and not be replaced by names and dates which had never been consciously meaningful to me
I know that intellectually this particular graveplot was important to Mr Naipaul only representatively generically
He had seen many like it in his southern travels
It was only one more small embodiment of this history we lived in the midst of and could not see for its proximity
I know that in a way I too was only representative as a son Naipaul was fascinated that I had come of this inarticulate haltingly selfconscious region with its mute narratives of breastworks in battlefields and family graves but had attempted a language
That was what he was doing on a much broader scale and we stood there together for a moment looking at the briargrown fence and the candlegleaming limestone shafts
My own uneasiness with these progenitorstelae was that they were both too familiar and unknowable like the shape of the DNA in my cells
The story of my great grandfather s having been shot through the lung at Chancellorsville had always had a faroff fictive unrelated quality for me
The iron CSA marker at the foot of his grave was only a curiosity
I suspected that Mr Naipaul saw me as the product of a history which the history of my own consciousness could only very partially incorporate
If I was at all to be read and to read myself it would have to be by the light reflected from a larger pattern
We had a set of cultural origins represented in part by the English hymns and King James scriptures of the Methodist church I had been raised in by the English china of my paternal grandmother s ritual dinners and by the English texts of my maternal grandmother s essays for shutins she herself crippled by arthritis her poignant sentimental quotations from Tennyson and Gray
I think we shared a feeling of hurtful early separation from a cultural centrality and savored in parallel irony the acrid substitutions of tobacco of the smokeborne essentiality of roast pig blue in a cloud across a broomsedged field like the literal s elegy for the absence of a language
Born to cultural deprivation we shared an aversion to the fashionable deprecations of high or established culture
The oppressions we had labored under as boys were those of the unassailable dumbness of societies so close to the soil and leaves that the articulating transformations had seemed almost unimaginable
That was why the rare alchemical act of gross green been so important why the flavorful smoke of the barbecue pit a substantial but spiritlike incense from the altar of a folk sacrifice had spoken so comfortingly
But there had not been enough of these informing signs and I had grown up contained in a history which surrounded and enclosed me in a feeling but not in an understanding
The South for me had been too often unconsciously omnipresent like water for a fish
For me the limestone markers were too literal and thus unrealizable and for Mr Naipaul I suspect too transparently representative
Perhaps he did not wish to lose the at least partially conscious person whom he had come partially to know into the pervasive history and its brute factuality
Perhaps he wished to preserve that space visible beyond us as it seemed from that distance a country graveplot one of the South s thousands of thousands unparticular uninscribed and thus potentially his own to possess by interpretation
I had offered him sights smells from Trinidad India and Africa had given me glimpses of their universal quality
We looked a moment longer at the briargrown fence and the limestone shafts and turned away unreadable
By JAMES APPLEWHITE
In a variety of books from Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature to Contingency Irony and Solidarity and a spate of influential articles Richard Rorty has mounted a farreaching critique of what might be called our contemporary intellectual pseudodoxia
That term Francis Bacon s was employed to refer to various notions in the human mind that stand in the way of the advancement of human knowledge
These notions or Idols were he said of four kinds and they needed to be overcome in the furtherance of knowledge Idols of the Tribe being inherent in human nature seduce us into believing that sensory perception can give us direct knowledge of reality rather than knowledge relative to the standpoint and coloration of the senses and refracted through the mind s own desire for coherence and regularity Idols of the Den reflect the particular and singular disposition of individual perceivers and the fact that their interpretations are dependent upon what is reflected in the cave of their to the symbolic forms of human commerce and exchange and their susceptibility to debasement whenever their inherent plurisignificance in Philip Wheelright s coinage is discounted or words are taken for things language confused with actual entities and Idols of the Theatre which Bacon associated with the purely inventive dogmas of various philosophical systems that sow the seeds of error in human minds operate not as lenses through which to see the universe as it actually is but as stage plays designed to produce particular effects on an audience
For our purposes it matters scarcely at all that Bacon prescribed as the antidote to these toxins what many intellectuals would now describe as but another poison
By insisting that human beings could regain mastery over the natural world only through the application of the scientific method for gathering data classifying material conducting experiments interpreting results and generalizing inductively Bacon was merely displacing one of the Idols of the Theatre with what Rorty would describe as another whose blandishments no longer need
What is more remarkable is that despite the foundationalist pretensions of Bacon s Great Instauration his diagnosis of modern idolatry carried within itself the clue to what many modern intellectuals Rorty among them would now accept as effective vaccines for these disorders
To counter the influence of the Idols of the Tribe Bacon recommended an epistemological skepticism toward all that is seemingly mirrored by our faculties of perception
To resist the temptations of the Idols of the Den he counseled suspicion of whatever the mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction
As a prosthetic for the Idols of the Marketplace he urged a new respect for the differences between language and its referents and a new appreciation of the equivocality of words
And finally as a preventive against the Idols of the Theatre he advised the cultivation of a studied disbelief holding that the nostrums of philosophy and particularly that kind of philosophy which confuses itself with the mixture of matters divine and human as heretical religion
""
Bacon s prescience in these matters is by no means a sign of Rorty s belatedness
It is rather a way of underscoring the scope and more importantly the essential significance of Rorty s philosophical project
Rorty is deeply opposed to putting science or reason in the place where religious faith or belief once were and he views all attempts to defend theory in what Stanley Fish calls the strong sense by developing a general model of hermeneutics that would be free of contingencies contextual circumstances and interested judgments as beside the point
And yet he is as committed as Bacon ever was to challenging the way we currently think about thought or rather the way we think about the relations between thought and experience
He wants to delineate what deserves to be called a new model of the constituents of this process and a different not to say more useful way of relating morally and socially
So conceived Rorty s project is part of the ongoing revision of American philosophical and cultural pragmatism
As we can now appreciate the project amounts to the most important critical and political attempt since John Dewey to resituate the tradition of American pragmatism within the broader framework of modern Western liberalism
It deserves to be described as at least a modest instauration to replace Bacon s great one because Rorty s project assumes that this resituating will require a fundamental alteration of the goal of liberal society itself and the creation of a new set of intellectual techniques for pursuing the mastery it affords
The word resituate is no accident here
In much recent literary criticism no small amount of it influenced by the position Rorty takes so powerfully in Consequences of Pragmatism pragmatism or neopragmatism as it is sometimes called has come to be associated with cultural currents that are thought to be postliberal if not antiliberal in some very specific ways
It aligns itself as a Kind of Writing and Nineteenthcentury Idealism and Twentiethcentury Textualism with the postmodernist and poststructuralist repudiation of culture as an expression of individual consciousness woven into patterns of consensus and dissent of conformity and conflict and it prefers to view culture as an intertextual system of signs that can be infinitely redescribed
It has thus positioned the critical recovery of pragmatist discourse essentially beyond the kinds of disputes that used to vex liberal criticism theoretically
The old disputes concerning the relation between the universal and the particular the absolute and the relative the political and the personal the necessary and the contingent the selfcreative and the socially reconstructive the ethical and the artistic are deemed by the neopragmatist either false or irrelevant
Whichever the case there immediately follows a rejection of the first term in each pair in favor of an embrace of the second and a subsequent assertion that pragmatic thinking is antifoundationalist antiessentialist antiintentionalist and antirepresentational
It is a pragmatism committed ultimately and exclusively to the effectual Contingencies of Value as the local figuringworking out as well as we heterogeneously can of what seems to work better rather than worse
It may therefore be described in Smith s version as the most ideologically unillusioned and politically unmotivated of critical theories or as in the version proposed by Walter Benn Michaels and Steven Knapp in their celebrated essay Against Theory as no theory at all
Rather it is a name for that kind of practice which is critical of all other practices that resort to theory for the sake of trying to govern practice from a position mistakenly assumed to exist outside of it
Rorty s relation to this postmodernist pragmatist revisioning has become increasingly complex
While supporting and as we shall see in certain ways furthering the ironizing of discourse to which this has led he has at the same time distanced himself from the wholesale critique of democratic individualism or what C B McPherson calls possessive individualism that goes along with Foucault in Nietzsche or Heidegger
Siding with those who accentuate the historicity and relativism of all cultural practices Rorty nonetheless insists that some practices like art and ethnography and one would suppose certain kinds of investigative journalism are much more humanlybeneficial than others such as theology or let us say advertising
Even as he dismisses all talk of history as an evolutionary process he still believes that intellectual and moral progress can be measured by the history of increasingly useful metaphors
Insisting that conscience as Freud taught us is a product of no more than the accidents of upbringing he yet writes a prose that is recurrently hortatory and determinedly edifying
These paradoxes would be more disconcerting if they were nt managed with such disarming candor and panache
Rorty reminds me a bit of Kenneth Burke s injunction to use all there is to use but here there is nothing eclectic about the all
By putting his all to selective as well as effective as Wallace Stevens once noted in a helpful distinction is intent on making sure of every foot of the way than like the poet whose attention is always diverted because the sense of the certainty of the presences about him is as nothing to the presences themselves
Rorty s version of pragmatism is clearly less interested than some of the other newer variants in repudiating its ties with the history of Western liberalism
He wants to recuperate albeit cautiously what may have been glossed in this process of postmodernist revisioning
This has recently entailed a change or at least a sharpening of focus in his own thinking about the pragmatic legacy itself at any rate it has led to an important extension and development of some of his earlier ideas particularly as they bear upon his interests in the culture of democracy
In its Rortian postmodernist form pragmatism is premised on the contingencies as Rorty describes them successively in the first three chapters of his new book of language is large with complexities but Rorty is masterful at threading his way through them
Pairing each term with a major thinker who serves less as a guide Rorty has assumed this Virgilian role for himself than as a kind of benchmark Davidson with language Freud with self and a combination of Isaiah Berlin Joseph Schumpeter Michael Oakeshott John Rawls and in the immediate background John Dewey with community Rorty proceeds to delineate the main elements of his proposal for the reconstitution of intellectual method
The contingency of language commits Rorty to the idea that truth is no longer out there in a reality beyond language but in here so to speak in the relations among our sentences
Truth is something we make with metaphors it is not already there waiting to be found with words
Just as nothing possesses an intrinsic nature neither words selves nor the world Rorty thinks of this as the residue of the notion that reality is the us no closer to the way things truly are
It only moves us into a more useful figurative or tropological relation with them
In this conception language is a medium neither exactly of representation nor of expression
It is rather an instrument of redescription
Davidson lets us think of the history of language and thus of culture as Darwin taught us to think of the history of a coral reef
Old metaphors are constantly dying off into literalness and then serving as a platform and foil for new metaphors
To accept this analogy is for Rorty to believe that a recognition of the contingency of language is tied inextricably to the dedivinization of the self and the world
This is the point made by intellectual historians like Hans Blumenberg who narrativize these connections by arguing that they are the product of a sequence of transformations
Where once upon a time we felt a need to worship something which lay beyond the visible world as Rorty summarizes the story Blumenberg tells in The Legitimacy of to worship something that lay within the world and thus decided to substitute the love of truth for the love of God
By the end of the eighteenth century however the love of truth was compelled to give way to the love of self as human beings transferred their worship from the quasi divinity of the world described by science to the quasi divinity of their own spiritual nature
But by the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth the idealistic or Romantic worship of the self was to be displaced by the realization variously phrased by Nietzsche Freud and Wittgenstein that we do nt in fact need to worship anything as divine once we recognize that everything our language our conscience our community is a product of time and chance
""
This is a narrative that lends considerable credence to the assumption that the self is linguistically constructed and that reality is largely unaffected by the language we attach to it
It also supports the with alterations in language than with revolutions in belief
As Kuhn argues in The Copernican Revolution we did not decide on the basis of some telescopic observations or on the basis of anything else that the earth was not the center of the universe that macroscopic behavior could be explained on the basis of microstructural motion and that prediction and control should be the principle aim of scientific theorizing
Rather after a hundred years of inconclusive muddle the Europeans found themselves speaking in a way which took these interlocked theses for granted
Language in this view is more like a set of tools for performing a task than a medium for getting something straight
But as Rorty points out the creators of new languages the inventors of new vocabularies unlike the masters of various crafts may not know what it is that they want to do before they have created a language with which to do it
Thus the problem of adequation still remains but it is now solved or longer how to secure agreement between one s language and something that stands beyond it such as fact truth or reality the world offers no criteria for comparing alternative metaphors but how to get over one way of talking and acquire the habit of another
This is pragmatism with a vengeance and Rorty is nothing if not consistent in practicing it
Since the key to changing minds is not better arguments but alternative vocabularies his chief discursive tactic is to make the positions he opposes look bad by showing how limited and brittle they are and to cast his own position in the most favorable light by revealing how many different issues it can illumine
Either way the oftnoted frustrations of Rorty s prose frustrations it should be remarked that have nothing to do with the lucidity of his sentences the deftness of his moves or the elegance of his examples begin to make sense
His occasional simplifications of opposing arguments his constant tacking in the face of stretches his agile but also disconcerting transitions from one analogy to another his incisive almost aphoristic synopses of supporting positions his constant and always slightly altered redescriptions of central points all find their justification in an Emersonian conviction that deference to the language of one s ancestors or at least to the inherited descriptions of their contingencies amounts to a kind of mortuary practice what Rorty describes in another arresting figure as worship of the corpses of their metaphors
""
This Emersonian iconoclasm thinking of Rorty no less than of Emerson it could as easily be described as an antinomian intransigence is nowhere more vividly exemplified than in the practice of the socalled strong poet
Rorty applies this term more broadly than does Harold Bloom to the originator of any new words the founder of any new languages but like Bloom and Emerson before him he conceives this figure a little hyperbolically as the vanguard of the species
All strong poets are ironists anything can be made to look good or bad by being redescribed and their renunciation of the attempt to formulate criteria of choice between final vocabularies
They are to be distinguished from the rest of us ironists by their ability to recreate what Nietzsche called the all it was into a thus I willed it
""
The strong poet is thus the kind of self who refuses to be a copy who is horrified at the thought of being in Bloom s wording a replica
The question is whether a self terrorized by the thought of living off the capital of other peoples creativity is more prepared than any other self to accept the fact of its own contingency
Indeed by couching the terms of his or her selfinvention in language usually reserved for the deity Rorty s strong poet seems in danger of the opposite of hypostatizing its own sense of being rather than provisionalizing it
To put this more directly if the portentous capacity to will oneself and direction to something as benign as an Emersonian or better a Franklinesque experiment in selfcreation can it not lead in another direction toward a Zarathustrean exercise in selfdeification
Despite the fact that we are all by now alerted to the significance of this kind of terminological instability Rorty can be occasionally obtuse about the referential equivocality it implies
To Rorty such verbal ambiguity is more often than not the sign of an epistemological playfulness that derives from the conviction that the self and the world have been emptied of intrinsic significance have become dedivinized so to speak leaving the field to those whose aim is to develop not The One Right Description but an expanding repertoire of alternative descriptions
Here the exemplary text is the first part of Derridats The Post Card entitled Envois whose whimsical fantasizing strikes Rorty as the end product of ironist theorizing
But to the careful reader of some of Rorty s own equivocations about Heidegger and Nabokov such verbal escapades Rorty calls them certain moral insensibility about the way in which play can become simply frivolous and possibly banal redescription evasive reweaving narcissistic
To Rorty such reservations as these almost fail to matter
The importance culture heroes possess for us Derrida being one of his is more often associated with the names of their books and the styles of selfperfection those books represent for us than with how well they live up to their own selfimages
But this begs several questions
One is whether there is always consensus about what those selfimages actually consist of
In the celebrated cases of Heidegger and say Paul de Man there seems to be a good deal of confusion on the part of their defenders and detractors alike as to what it was they meant to represent in the first place
Another has to do with whether our caring or not caring about the integrity of our culture heroes remains the same no matter what they represent
Again it would seem that the de Man and Heidegger affairs all parties to all sides of the current debate about these figures seem to care about nothing other than the relation between the images of self projected by their work and the actual lives they led
Not that Rorty finds all strong poets admirable any more than he believes all redescribers are invincible
If the world and the self have been deprived of their divinity this neither means that the world and the self have lost their power over us nor that the experts in human redescription will always invent selfimages we will want to emulate
Rorty is acutely sensitive to the fact that the world can overcome us that other selves can betray and destroy us that our own vulnerability to despair grief and rage can engulf us
But in adding that the only remedy to such hazards lies as so many strong poets have attested over the centuries in our ability to acknowledge contingency pain and otherness for what they are he may be slighting the other half of their testimony the invention of the self and the abjection of the self
In other words their realism whether comic or tragic has not stopped short of acknowledging that the self in its very desire to achieve autonomy and redefinition is often the author of its own embarrassments the creator of its own pain the parent of its own misery
Nor was this insight lost on the figure most central to Rorty s discussion of the self
Freud s theory of human nature acquired its immense modern authority not simply because it verified the fairly recent discovery that human beings are products of the contingencies of their upbringing what set it apart from all other contemporary theories equally historicist and positivist was that it also confirmed the more traditional and tragic view that in their desire to escape or overcome these contingencies human beings simultaneously become the muses of their own unmaking
This lacuna in Rorty s understanding of Freud and by extension in his appreciation of the legacy of strong poets does not deter him from might be called secondary redescribers such as literary and cultural critics
Comparers rather than explainers or inventors contextualizers more than evaluators or creators the Arnolds and Trillings and Sontags and Spivaks of this world are experts in placing books in relation to other books
Hence their range of acquaintance is more important than their deep readings
By constantly enlarging the sphere of the cultural conversation they help us resist the seductions of any one final vocabulary
It is worth observing that Rorty extends the notion of literature to include any works that critics discuss any works that might conceivably have moral relevance might conceivably alter one s sense of what is possible and important
Literary criticism thus becomes regrafted on the branch of what was once called moral philosophy
But in critical terms moral philosophy then becomes to a discouraging extent largely academicized
The critic is no longer obliged to determine the literary merits or the moral worth of any work but can content him or herself with encouraging ethical reflection advisors and suggesting ways in which the tensions within this canon may be eased or where necessary sharpened
""
If strong poets like Hegel Nietzsche Heidegger Derrida and Foucault afford us models of selfperfection of individual salvation Rorty finds their usefulness in social reconstruction very much more limited
While they are of enormous assistance in freeing the self for redescription and thus in helping liberal society exchange the dream of rationalizing for that of poetizing itself they are pretty much useless when it comes to politics
Their central social task is restricted to furthering the dedivinization of liberal culture by showing how the languages of moral responsibility and social purpose are always contingent
But they have little to contribute to the actual restructuring of society
For that we must turn to an entirely different line of thinkers to authors such as Marx Mill Dewey and Habermas who have made the public sphere and not the private the subject of their reflections
Interestingly enough Rorty no need of conceptual redescription
Though he takes many of his cues from modern social thinkers like Michael Oakeshott and John Rawls philosophers who have retained Enlightenment liberalism while dropping Enlightenment rationalism he writes that J S Mill s suggestion that governments devote themselves to optimizing the balance between leaving people s private lives alone and preventing suffering seems to me pretty much the last word
The ideal citizen of this new world of revisionary American liberalism will therefore be an ironist who combines an acceptance of the contingency of all political perspectives with a belief that whatever is meant by the good and the true in liberal societies will always be a function of free discussion
Rorty has read too much of the Frankfurt school and Marxist theory generally to believe that freedom is ever innocent of ideological coloring
All he asks for or thinks we need is the standard bourgeois kind of freedom that is possible when the press the judiciary the elections and the universities are free social higher education is common and peace and wealth have made possible the leisure necessary to listen to lots of different people and think about what they say
While such freedoms may have nothing more to recommend them than the kind of support history shows they have furnished for private agendas of selfrecreation Rorty thinks that they can and do generate distinctive public debates about two issues central to the creation and maintenance of a democratic society
The first is how to balance the private need for individual selffulfillment with the public need to leave people alone to use or abuse such personal opportunities as they will
The second is how the desires democracies typically create for wealth freedom and peace can be adjusted to the fact that those desires can not be equally accommodated economically socially and politically
Rorty s liberal is thus not without convictions
Drawing on Judith Shklar s definition of a liberal as a person who thinks that cruelty is the worst thing we do he adds to this a thing we do
As a liberal Rorty accounts these convictions socially and ethically salutary as an ironist he knows that this can not be proved
The liberal is therefore placed in the paradoxical situation of having to grant as Isaiah Berlin once quoted Joseph Schumpeter to say the relative validity of his or her own convictions and yet stand for them unflinchingly
Schumpeter conceived of this paradox as the difference between barbarism and civilization
Berlin himself is more circumspect
While he is prepared to admit the deep metaphysical need for greater ontological certainty he is equally convinced that to allow this need to determine one s life is symptomatic of an equally deep and more dangerous moral and political immaturity
""
Rorty understands this admonition to mean or at any rate to give him license to say that the aim of liberal society should be to cure us of the dependence on metaphysics by which he also means metaphysical theory altogether
Berlin merely says us
The difference in interpretation is revealing
What Rorty characterizes as a disease from which we should all be healed Berlin regards as a basic human desire which should not be misapplied
Therefore what the liberalism of Berlin is willing to tolerate so long as it can be constrained the liberalism of Rorty is intent on expunging as an infection
Hence Rorty s liberalism is anything but socially passive and it is also anything but consistently ironic
If on the public side it is committed to extending solidarity to those who are presently and injuriously excluded from it on the private side it is resolved that we can only make the best selves of ourselves as we can if we turn antimetaphysics into the intellectual architectonic of a New Cultural Dispensation and construe dedivinization as its new method essentially its new rhetoric of salvation
There are serious difficulties with both these commitments
Rorty has a firm grasp of the one but only a tentative grip on the other
On the political excluded can only carry us so far in the direction of social renewal because the languages of personal hope and public responsibility are philosophically incommensurable
By this he means that if solidarity is the best thing we do and Rorty is emphatic on this point there is no way of satisfactorily explaining its relationship with selfcreation
On the contrary Rorty is convinced and in many respects is convincing that more than twenty centuries worth of attempts to reconcile the language of personal fulfillment and the language of social obligation have ended in the sand
The only alternative is to keep these languages as separate as possible and to live with the compromise this entails
The compromise situates him he believes almost directly between the Foucaults of this world who are too ironic to be liberal and the Habermases who are too liberal to be ironic
Such a person is willing to live with the tension of believing with the Nietzschean Foucauldian line that most of our social ills derive from turning private provisional vocabularies the tradition from Mill and Dewey to Habermas that the social goal of reducing pain and humiliation may be more commanding than any necessity for individual redefinition
The reason he ca nt bring these two lines of reflection into closer conversation is because he is convinced that the radical metaphysical suspicions of the one undercut the inevitable metaphysical pretensions of the other
But this is to forget that Dewey who is another of Rorty s culture heroes described metaphysics as simply another form of redescription and then went on to show if not in Experience and Nature the text that served as the basis for Rorty s famous repudiation of metaphysics then in Art as Experience how in a truly poetized or estheticized universe metaphysics furnishes the motivating force for redescribing itself
Dewey s procedure was to argue that to estheticize or poetize experience is to define it as a process whose realizations completions or consummations as Dewey termed them possess as part of their nature the tendency to generate more experiences like an esthetic model of experience guarantees that there can be no last words no final closures no ultimate endings because the processes which occur there are always being translated into something more something different
Redescription then simply becomes what life is like when lived under the sign of the poem
But Dewey did not stop there
For he knew that the sign of the poem the agon of esthetics is always social rather than solitary
It is social both because its rhetorical aim is to communicate and because it springs from a shared fund of experience
Dewey s estheticism thus confirmed his liberalism by showing that fraternity can never be dissociated as Rorty thinks it must from liberty and equality
Unless we grant that our private life with ourselves is dependent upon our shared life with others we have no way of accounting for why we should either be concerned about others or want to change ourselves
Rorty is much too serious a thinker to leave these things to chance and postmodernist commitment to contingency and irony to eviscerate his notion of community
This finally leaves us as we shall see with a liberalism disconcertingly reminiscent of the caricature posed by its recent leftist critics a liberalism whose sense of freedom verges on being another name for selfishness and whose conception of solidarity is to a very large degree based on mutual suffering
Rorty is not afraid of criticism from the left since he thinks that the politics of liberalism like its ethics can only be justified in terms of what Wilfrid Sellars calls weintentions
In the language of weintentions the bourgeois liberal is simply someone whose special sense of we from the late eighteenth century to the present has been predicated at least partially on what Nathaniel Hawthorne speaking of his own art once described as a series of attempts and very imperfectly successful ones to open an intercourse with the world
However Rorty does not think of this either as an ancient human disposition with Europe and America in the last three hundred years
It is not associated with any power larger than that embodied in a concrete historical situation for example the power of the rich European and American democracies to disseminate their customs to other parts of the world a power which was enlarged by certain past contingencies and has been diminished by certain more recent contingencies
In this instance loyalty to our own society is as Rorty said in his essay Postmodern Bourgeois Liberalism loyalty enough
""
""
it need be responsible only to its own traditions
""
Such sentiments really prejudices nonetheless leave Rorty in an awkward position
In a book that seeks among other things to spell out for the postmodern era the new terms of the social compact he seems to be defending what looks like ethnocentrism
Clifford Geertz in what has already become a classic essay entitled The Uses of Diversity charges that Rorty is in fact trying to make a response from Rorty On Ethnocentrism A Reply to Clifford Geertz that goes a long way toward clarifying what remains problematic about Rorty s insistence on maintaining the distinction between the individual and the social the personal and the political or what he calls in the essay just named private narcissism and public pragmatism
An exchange that is centered on what Rorty means by antiantiethnocentrism it turns essentially as I read it around two questions
The first is whether selfknowledge and thus the quest through redescription for individual realization is at all possible without learning how to think rather differently about the social other
The second is whether procedural justice as Rorty would practice it is for the liberal a satisfactory antidote to the social misery caused both by our innate proclivities to be cruel and by our equally habitual inattention to suffering when it occurs in places or among people unfamiliar to us
To take them one at a time there are way Rorty divorces selfknowledge from social awareness
One derives from the character of contemporary experience itself where the social boundaries between self and other between familiar and foreign between private and public have now become infinitely more blurred boundaryless and fluid than they once were
With foreignness now beginning at the skin s edge as Geertz puts it rather than the water s experience has taken on the aspect of an enormous collage making the world
""
""
at each of its local points
""
""
look more like a Kuwaiti bazaar than like an English Gentlemen s Club
Rorty agrees but insists that the development of the bazaar has not brought an end to the clubs for gentlemen
If anything it has only made the virtues of the clubs that much more apparent after a hard day s haggling in which you smile a lot and make the best deals you can they offer a place of retreat where you equals
""
Rorty thus remains undaunted by the prospect that contemporary existence has turned into an exotic marketplace where most of the participants would rather die than share the beliefs of many of those with whom they must haggle
While this social situation will never encourage the creation of the kind of community longed for by liberalism s critics the Gemeinschaft of a Robert Bellah or an Alisdair MacIntyre it will certainly not discourage the creation of a civil society of the democratic sort
All you need Rorty adds is the ability to control your feelings when people who strike you as irredeemably different show up at the Hotel de Ville or the greengrocer s or the bazaar
Geertz on the other hand is of the opinion that such control will prove a very inadequate instrument of social cohesion when the liberal discovers that the club has also been politicized and now confronts him or her with the same social situation represented by the bazaar a world composed of irremovable
A second reason for Geertz s skepticism is that even if we think we live in a society where social and cultural boundaries still remain carefully drawn and comfortably coincident the real boundaries of the self as Arthur Danto points out in an article on which Geertz draws are defined instead by the gaps between me and those who think differently than I which is to say everyone and not simply those segregated by differences in generations sex nationality sect and even race
Without a perception of such gaps and the asymmetries they represent we have no way of discovering as Geertz puts it at what sort of angle
""
""
we stand to the world
And lacking such knowledge we are powerless either to determine where we really are or what it feels like to occupy such a place or whether on reflection we might like to change our location
Thus Geertz concludes
To obscure those gaps and those asymmetries difference mere unlikeness which is what ethnocentrism does and is designed to do
""
""
is to cut us off from such knowledge and such possibility the possibility of quite literally and quite thoroughly changing our minds
This would be a less damaging criticism if Rorty s position were nt everywhere predicated on the possibility of our knowing who we and they are and of being able to change our minds through redescription if we want to
But it does nt seem to bother Rorty in the least because he is convinced that such distinctions and desires depend not on destroying ethnocentrism but rather on maintaining it
To wet liberals presumably like Geertz the supposition that the exclusivity of the private club might be a crucial feature of an ideal world order will undoubtedly look like a betrayal of the Enlightenment
To dry liberals like Rorty by contrast it is the Enlightenment that originally betrayed us by encouraging us to nature and shared moral aspirations
If we abandon hopes for a universal culture based upon a univocal sense of the human we will then see as thick describers like Geertz himself have taught us that such exclusivity is merely a necessary and proper condition of selfhood and one that when assumed by a liberal we such as our own a we that has been raised to be suspicious of ethnocentrism to begin with may well prove to be just what is needed to keep the bazaar open to keep the institutions of procedural justice functioning
""
This brings us to the second point of contention between Geertz and Rorty which has to do with whether procedural justice as presently conceived is an adequate instrument for the relief of human suffering and humiliation
Rorty clearly thinks it is but admits that some clubs like ours will view procedural justice as a moral commitment while others eg theirs will construe it simply as a matter dubious and offers as an example of its cultural and moral limitations The Case of the Drunken Indian and the Kidney Machine
This case turns on the conflict between a native American who is unwilling to abandon his alcoholism after being placed on dialysis and the medical protocols governing the use of such therapy a conflict that reflects deep moral assumptions on the part of society generally about who deserves to have access to the therapy
So far as Geertz is concerned the point of the story is that the lack of understanding on both sides of this divide about what it means to be on the opposite side prevented either party from understanding even its own position
While to be sure a rough kind of justice was served inasmuch as the Indian was permitted to stay on the machine until he died all sorts of procedures had to be waived because of the general social inability to understand variant subjectivities and therefore to comprehend why the rules must often be changed to accommodate new however Geertz s reading manages to get things pretty much reversed
Whatever measure of justice was achieved in this case and it was as much he thinks as could be decently hoped for resulted directly from the integrity and not the deficiency of the procedures involved
Further understanding of moral diversities and asymmetries would have only gotten in the way
Rorty is therefore cheered rather than depressed by this little fable
To him it shows just how well the system works when the tasks of understanding of knowing how the Indian s victimization at the hands of whites together with his own ethnic traditions may have contributed both to his alcoholism and to his rebellion are left to the connoisseurs of diversity or agents of love as Rorty somewhat patronizingly describes ethnographers novelists journalists and their kind and when the task of social implementation of making sure that everyone gets treated the same once they have been demarginalized is left to the as he describes the lawyers politicians and businesspeople who run the system
Rorty is eager to keep around lots of the agents of love because he knows that they are essential to enlarging the liberal sense of we
And yet he is convinced that the world would not function at all without an abundance of the agents of justice if only because the bias of their own liberal procedures particularly if they are ironists has the practical advantage of allowing individuals and cultures to get along together without intruding on each other s privacy without meddling with each other s conception of the good
""
Rorty s position about the Indian and dialysis like his view of solidarity generally is of a piece with his desire to move the Enlightenment tradition away from its original concern with rationalism rights and moral obligations and toward a more liberal concern with finitude contingency and redescription
This is a move designed to turn solidarity into a matter rather than a recognition of something antecedently shared
The problem with this aspiration is that Rorty is of two minds about which details however meticulously described might make other selves seem one of us and he resists the idea that thick describers like novelists possess any magical formulas for making such details move us
In the last chapter of Contingency Irony and Solidarity for example as well as in the essay On Ethnocentrism the details that seem to matter most to him are those which stress the most obvious resemblance between us and them those that suggest a shared membership in the same set of clubs ethnic economic social political religious
In most of the rest of the book however the more salient details appear to be those that speak to our common vulnerability to adversity
Either way Rorty sees little or no bearing on our sense of solidarity of that entire spectrum of details that Stanley Cavell thinking of calls the ordinary
Constituted of commonplace tasks and quotidian pleasures the ordinary may represent a range of experience we mostly take for granted but it is also a range of experience whose deprivation we can least afford to suffer because it is so closely tied to the sensed humanity we share with others
Such at any rate is the testimony of Salman Rushdie whose cruel confinement because of Ayatollah Khomeini s death sentence has robbed him of such routine privileges as shopping for groceries taking a walk going to a movie browsing at a magazine rack or driving a car What I miss is just that these tiny little things
When you have them you think they re completely unimportant or even chores
""
""
but when you ca nt do them you realize that in fact that s what life is that s real life
""
To say that people may possess more of a capacity to identify with the details of dailiness than with the of mutual affiliation is neither to suggest that human beings share a common nature nor to imply that thick describers such as novelists should abandon the effort to sensitize us to woe and hurt wherever they occur
It is merely to point out that for various psychological and cultural reasons it may be more difficult to empathize much less sympathize with the painful and the pitiless than with the prosaic
Rorty s myopia about this seems to follow from the distinction he posits everywhere but never quite manages to sustain except rhetorically between private hope and public responsibility between the demands of selfcreation and those of human bonding
It is a distinction he frequently tries to enforce by associating it with other oppositions that are equally indifferent to the claims of the ordinary like those between justice and love or irony and common sense or force and persuasion
As it happens all these distinctions live an odd life in Rorty s prose
Whatever their function as counters in his arguments they tend to absolutize these oppositions he also absolutizes their opposition or what amounts to the same thing he rarely entertains the possibility that their opposition may itself be a product of contingency and may thus be in no sense philosophically or terminologically given
To concede that their relations are themselves contingent Rorty would have to be more attentive to their historicity to the different kinds of calculus that as critical coordinates they make possible in different discursive contexts and successive cultural eras
Would the historical record bear him out for instance in his contention that the vocabulary of selfcreation is always and inevitably private the vocabulary of justice always and necessarily public Is nt this precisely the kind of distinction that has become so frequently blurred unstable or occluded in if not before the postmodern fiction of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez a Jamaica Kincaid a Milan Kundera a Thomas Pynchon or a Nadine Gordimer Or to take another example in a world so wholly organized and coordinated in of other images a world where nationstates justify foreign policies as Carlos Fuentes has recently pointed out by appealing to the trope of individual selfdescription popularized by the Frank Sinatra lyric about doing it my way is it any longer possible to differentiate clearly say between force and persuasion or between power and inducement or between indoctrination and influence Why for that matter is common sense which Charles Saunders Peirce associated with those ideas and beliefs that man s situation absolutely forces upon him so constantly identified with the husks of dead metaphors when so many historians of everyday life have just as often shown it to represent the musculature of live ones
These queries raise troubling issues about the narrow or angled interpretation Rorty gives to some of his key terms
His notion of the contingent for instance is curiously unweighted allowing all particular historical contingencies from the haphazard and accidental to the fated and inevitable to sink to the same level in affiliated with doubt skepticism and disbelief that it loses all contact with such related concepts as the discrepant the gratuitous and the incongruous
It is for that reason never allowed to curve toward the comic where we might well see how it serves as a corrective for the effects not only of essentialism but also of pride and stupidity
Even Rorty s notion of language suffers deformation when he assumes that what Wittgenstein meant by the claim that all feeling and thought are grounded in a form of life is that the limits of our world have now been reduced to the limits of our language
As Geertz has noted in The Uses of Diversity this is not exactly what the man said
""
What he said
""
""
was that the limits of my language are the limits of my world which implies not that the reach of our minds of what we can say think appreciate and judge is trapped within the borders of our society our that the reach of our minds the range of signs we can manage somehow to interpret is what defines the intellectual emotional and moral space within which we live
This is why an increase in the number and kind of cultural symbols people are able to interpret can lead to an enlargement of the mind with which they try to grasp them a broadening of the sympathies with which they try to engage them
Change the language people use the symbols they employ and you can as we have learned since the Berlin Wall came down alter the world they inhabit
But Rorty wants to keep these alterations within welldefined cultural and linguistic borders
Hence his skepticism about the possibility of any moments when as James and Dewey maintained and Richard Poirier has more recently contended we can stand beyond language or at least beyond any of its conventional mediations without necessarily standing beyond experience
Rorty would take such moments to be symptomatic of the religious delusion that we can achieve think such moments presuppose or need represent are perceptual occasions no doubt often induced by language that currently resist incorporation within our traditionally inherited vocabularies and verbal technologies
In any event whether described as experiences of the ineffable the undecidable or simply the vague they have long been of particular interest to the pragmatist philosophical tradition and are often produced as Poirier has pointed out in The Renewal of Literature by the tropological behavior of language itself
Indeed this is one way of describing the office of the strong poet someone whose redescriptions are predicated on the human ability through language to avail us of possibilities for understanding that transcend language
By remaining distrustful of or indifferent to such capacities and the moments they make available to the imagination Rorty is compelled to reduce severely the heuristic value of art and particularly the novel to a largely diagnostic function either to reveal the seeds of cruelty within ourselves or to disclose hidden sites of pain and suffering
What gets lost project is something more than art s capacity to describe all that James Agee meant by the radiance of what is
What disappears is the belief that art poetry fiction can sometimes lift us out of ourselves as when we see or feel experience or a portion of it from the perspective of another
Solidarity can be achieved in no other way
And no proposal for the renovation of intellectual inquiry and the reformation of society as ambitious or acute as Rorty s can furnish us with sufficient mastery of our postmodern predicament that does not show us how to enhance it

INTRODUCTION PROPERTY AND FREEDOM
Although perhaps not terribly informative Maurice Cranston is nevertheless correct By definition a liberal is a man who believes in liberty At the core of every liberal theory is some case for individual liberty liberals may disagree about the nature of this case but there is little doubt that liberal theory is freedomcentered Liberals have characteristically understood private property as complementing and safeguarding freedom insofar as personal holdings define a sphere within which their holder enjoys the protected liberty to act as he may see fit
Viewed from a different perspective however the complementarity of property rights and liberty is problematic
In a wellknown essay Alan Gibbard observes
If a person owns a thing his ownership enhances his liberty but it does so at the expense of the liberty of others
Ownership of a thing gives a person the fight to exclude others from its use and that right though it adds to the freedom of the owner Gibbard thereby points to a possible tension in the liberal case for private property
Once my right to X is established then I enjoy options with respect to the use or disposition of X that I previously lacked
You however are now burdened by a correlative obligation to defer to my decisions concerning X As L T Hobhouse remarked the property that confers freedom on the owner may at the same time limit or destroy the freedom of another
 From the perspective of liberty then it would seem that the creation of the property right is at best a wash The apparent implication is that an advocate of freedom will have a difficult time justifying property rights on the grounds that they are freedomenhancing
The very devotion to liberty that defines liberalism may it would seem motivate abandonment or substantial qualifications of a regime of robustly private property
In this essay we consider in just what way rights to freedom relate to a right to property
Gibbard and Mort s property right to X does indeed restrict Millie s liberty with respect to X Such restriction is precisely the point of a recognition of rights
However we claim this is not a special feature of property rights as distinguished from other rights nor does it somehow imply that freedom and property are in special conflict
The arguments of the first three sections of the paper support the judgment that property rights are no more problematic within the context of liberal theory than other quintessentially liberal rights such as freedom of speech
Many theorists have however believed that the justification of title to private property diverges significantly from other strands of liberal justificatory theory
In the fourth section we offer an assessment of why these theorists take property to be different

RIGHTS TO FREEDOM
""
Hobbesian Liberty and Morality
In one respect all rights indeed all morality limit liberty
We can imagine a liberty that preexists the moral boundaries constituted by rights including rights to property
Indeed Hobbes had clone the imagining for us in his depiction of the state of nature
The fundamental law of nature he maintains is that Naturally every man has a right to everything
 By right he understands simply the liberty to do or to forbear Elsewhere Hobbes described this as our blameless liberty of using our own natural power and ability
 Each then has a blameless liberty to do anything he must in order to promote his overriding concern namely his selfpreservation
Since it is rational for each to act to preserve himself and since each has a blameless liberty to do whatever he must no one can be said to be blameworthy or irrational when his selfpreserving actions impose harms on others
It is therefore neither absurd nor reprehensible neither against the dictates of true reason for a man to use all his endeavours to preserve and defend his body and the members thereof from death and reason that all men account to be done justly and with right
""
This condition of absolute premoral liberty lacks two important features of the liberty that obtains within a moralized sociality
First it does not ensure to individuals the ability to live as pursuers of values and projects
If each may exercise a blameless liberty to encroach on others in whatever way may seem requisite for improving one s survival chances the ability of each to pursue his projects and values is gravely impugned
Mort s bestlaid plans may and often will come a cropper to Millie s conflicting designs
Life in such circumstances will not often afford to individuals the opportunity to devote themselves in coherent fashion to longterm designs
Rather it will be a thoroughly grim affair memorably characterized by Hobbes as solitary poor nasty brutish and short
 Conversely general recognition of moral obligations not to encroach on the protected spheres of others grounds the possibility of a freedom to pursue those this is a freedom that each agent typically has reason to prize there is a crucial sense in which those liberties consequent on the establishment of moral protections render individuals significantly more free than they would be in their absence rights so understood do augment freedom
Second premoral liberty conflicts with individuals virtually inescapable conviction that they stand in a unique normative relation to their own actions
To see this consider the situation of a hardy soul who despite Hobbes s dour imprecations is inclined to give the regime of complete amoral liberty a try
Hobbes of course insists that this would be foolhardy but he is a notorious pessimist concerning such matters
Others of sunnier mien may be more optimistic concerning their prospects in the state of nature
Suppose then that Mort declines the invitation to enter into a social contract with others
He thereby maintains his primordial liberty to pursue his ends in whichsoever way he judges suitable and others possess a like liberty with regard to Mort
direct his activity either by sheer force or threats he has no ground for complaint
Mort may find himself enslaved or imprisoned and yet he must admit that he has no basis for resentment or indignation To be sure he may be angry that they enslaved him or surprised that they managed to do so
But what he can not do is claim that he occupies a privileged position visavis his own activity that they have wrongfully failed to respect
Rather Mort is obliged to acknowledge that they have as much entitlement to control Mort s activity as he himself does
Where only liberties obtain everything and everyone is fair game
It seems doubtful though that we can think of ourselves in this way
We take ourselves to be intimately related to our own activity as something intrinsic to who and what we are rather than as some external thing in which both we and others might take an interest
Nor does it seem sufficient to conceive of this special relation in purely descriptive but normatively neutral fact that it just so happens that your determinations concerning how your arms and legs shall move typically correlate more closely with their subsequently observed motions than do my wishes concerning the deportment of your limbs
Rather we maintain a special authority to direct our own activity a claim against others that all else equal they not undertake to subvert this control
If Mort really wants to give the Hobbesian state of nature a try he not only must be prepared for others continually to frustrate his activity but he also must bring himself to concede that his own efforts to determine the course of his activity are morally on a par with the attempts of others to control Mott s doings
It is far from clear that this is something that he can simply will to do
To the extent that persons are irremediably indisposed to adopt a detached stance toward their own activities they are rationally barred from espousing Hobbesian amoralism
""
Claim Rights to Freedom
Mott s difficulties point us who populate Hobbes s state of nature
What can rightfully be described as the liberal conception of a free person involves not only the bare power of an agent to act according to his own determinations but also a claim against others that they not interfere
That is rather than assert a mere liberty to act the liberal person asserts a claim right to act as he sees fit 
Claim rights unlike the liberties of the state of nature restrict the freedom of others
If Mort is at liberty to Theta he is under no duty to refrain from Thetaing it is not wrong for him to Theta
But if all that Mort enjoys is a liberty it is not wrong for Millie to interfere with his Thetaing
Should he however assert a claim right to Theta he maintains that Millie is under a duty not to interfere
Claim rights unlike mere liberties attempt to demarcate a region of moral space against which others may not encroach
Now acknowledges it she is from one perspective at least a loser from the transaction
To be restricted is all else equal to be rendered worse off and it is specifically to be worse off with respect to one s liberty
That is the sense in which all claim rights are intrinsically libertydiminishing
But of course all else need not be equal
Restrictions on liberty can render available goods other than liberty and thus from the perspective of the individual be judged a good bargain
Yet more significantly they can generate a class of liberties unknown in the state of nature morally protected liberties
Therefore even from the perspective of liberty alone the acceptance of restrictions can be rationally advisable Although theories of liberal rights differ among themselves in many important ways each affirms that some restrictions of premoral liberty are warranted
More precisely each maintains that wouldbe rights claimants are able to justify those restrictions to the individuals called on to forbear right to Theta is himself better off than he was in the Hobbesian state of nature
He retains his liberty to Theta and joins to it an assurance that others will not obstruct his action
From his perspective the claim right is freedomenhancing
But from Millie s perspective Mort s claim right is freedomrestricting if Mort has a claim right to Theta then she must not interfere with his Thetaing
Why should she accede to this restriction
Mott s justificatory task is to provide Millie with some good reasons for giving up her Hobbesian liberty to interfere
And of course the traditional liberal answer is that Millie too benefits from a moral regime although she loses her liberty to interfere with Mort s Thetaing she gains claim rights of her own which in turn restrict Mott s liberty in some areas
That is they stand symmetrically with respect to what is gained and what is forgone
If the justificatory engine runs smoothly it will turn out that each civil society is justifiable to each from the person s own perspective 
""
Property Rights and Other Freedoms
It is important to stress that the foregoing considerations apply with full generality to all putative claim rights not simply those that involve holdings in property
To see that that is so consider the right to freedom of speech
It is apparent that what Gibbard says about entitlements to property equally applies to freedom of speech if a person has a right to speak as he sees fit that will enhance his freedom but it will correspondingly restrict the freedom of others
Mott s rightful liberty to utter and publish and promulgate blasphemous theses entails an absence of liberty on the part of the disapproving cleric to censor Mort or cast him in prison as punishment for the offense he causes
That is not to say anything noteworthy about the nature of speech but it is to characterize the logical structure of a right
If rights are a normative resource they enhance the opportunities In this regard freedom of speech is no different from any other right it restricts the freedom of others to act
We maintain then that what holds for rights in general applies without additional qualification to property rights they enhance the freedom of the possesor to act as he sees fit
But if so then it would seem that the observation that Mort s property rights restrict Millie s freedom does not indicate something uniquely awkward or exceptional about property rights that requires a justificatory strategy over and above that which generates other liberal rights
If we are correct then those commentators who hold property rights to be especially problematic have misconceived their status
Because this misconception is widespread however its source merits closer attention
""
WORRIES ABOUT THE FOUNDATIONS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS
""
Common Property and Private Property
Gibbard suggests that property holdings may be problematic insofar as they disturb an initial moral order in which everything is open to common use
He writes
Everyone let can lose a natural fight only by a voluntary act such as agreeing to give that right up or forfeiting it through violating the rights of someone else Now what are one s natural rights with respect to things For my purposes I shall need only a vague answer to this question I shall suppose that everyone has equal rights to the use of all things 
The implication seems to be this if everyone has equal rights to the use of all things then Mort s claim of an exclusive right to the use of some particular thing stands in violation of the natural rights of everyone else
Gibbard s supposition is questionable in several respects
First it is unclear what Gibbard means by a natural right
One thing he might mean is that natural rights are justifiable to agents in virtue of their interests or beliefs or desires but foundational of other conventional or subsidiary rights derivative therefrom
So understood however there does not even the vague characterization that Gibbard supplies
Before we can understand which rights might be foundational in this sense we need to understand the avenues of justification through which they are elicited and Gibbard quite deliberately aims to evade that requirement
Second the scope of things is unclear
Presumably the term is meant to exclude agents themselves as well as their actions and undetached bodily parts and to include tangible entities external to them such as land and chattel
Unless some such distinction is implicit the supposition that everyone has equal rights to the use of all things is thoroughly implausible
As was argued in section Mort is not likely to accept the suggestion that everyone has equal rights to the use of Mort s spleen or to decide whether Mort will offer a deconstructionist analysis of Leviathan at the philosophy department picnic
These are matters concerning which he will take himself to possess some distinctive unequal authority
But once one concedes the absence of equal rights over persons with respect to all else becomes dubious
If Mort believes that he has reason to claim special authority with respect to his own body he is unlikely to accede to a decision procedure in which everyone has an equal say concerning the disposition of the food that Mort has foraged or raised for the sustenance of the body that is his
Similarly an agent who believes himself entitled to press a claim for privileged status with respect to his own actions has reason to extend that claim to his use of those external things requisite for action minimally the ground on which he stands while acting
These facts about the tight relation between controlling things and one s enablement as an agent are not obscure and their normative thrust seems to be quite different than that which Gibbard implies
The egalitarianism that suggests itself is not one of equal rights to the use of all things but rather an equal propriety on the part of each agent to demand unequal title to some things
Third and most serious there
Does he intend claim rights rights with concomitant restrictions on the liberties of others or does he have in mind something like a purely Hobbesian liberty that carries no restrictions The former is thoroughly implausible
Locke can assume an initial position of some sort of common ownership because he postulates that God has given the earth to all men in common
Absent that theological premise or one of equivalent power there is no basis for positing a moral order of delicately equalized claim rights and concomitant restrictions
Rather the only equality that might be taken as antedating any particular system of parceling out morally protected claims is the equality of norestraint that vexed Hobbes and for which he understood political order to be the solution
In other words in the absence of what for Locke is literally a deus ex machina no grounds exist for commencing with a universal socialism from which all subsequent movement toward other patterns of property in things originate
The problem for those not encumbered or favored getting from one relatively inefficient system of ownership to another that is its Paretosuperior but rather of demonstrating that where previously there were no restraints all have good reasons to accept a system of restraint
""
Consent and the Creation of New Obligations
If it is implausible to suppose a moral starting point of everyone possessing equal fractional claim rights to all things we might consider instead whether Gibbard has in mind the sort of negative communism described by Jeremy Waldron
Perhaps the original community of goods does not actually involve any claim
rights at all which might stand in the way of private appropriation but only and at most Hohfeldian privileges such as the privilege of making use of the resources God has provided
On this account each individual would be at liberty to use any resources in the sense that he would have no duty not to do so but nobody at least initially would be conceived to have any rights capable of generating duties on others were interested 
Prima facie it is hard to see how Gibbard s consent requirement can be based on mere liberties
If both Mort and Millie have a liberty to use X neither is morally beholden to the other
Millie s liberty in no way restricts the range of Mort s permissible actions and so he does not need Millie s consent to use X in whatever way he chooses
Gibbard explicitly insists however that Mort s acquisition reqires Millie s consent and he also seems to understand the natural right to the equal use of all things as a liberty
Within limits I shall suppose a person has a right to consume things and to transform one thing into another
Such acts change the position of others by changing the world physically and thereby denying other people opportunities they would otherwise have
My rights to do such things may well be limited
I do not though invariably need another person s consent to change the physical world do need his consent to bring him under new moral constraints to make it cease to be morally permissible for him to do certain things that he can do or to make it morally permissible to coerce him in certain ways 
The point seems to be this
Mort does not need Millie s consent to exercise his liberty to use X even if as a matter of fact his exercise of that liberty means that X is not available for Millie to use
Her opportunities are physically limited but her moral status has not been altered
But if Mort claims a property right to X he not only claims that he is at liberty to use it but also that Millie is under a new moral duty not to use it
That is where the need for Millie s consent seems to enter
One may unilaterally transform things but not the moral status of other persons
Three features of Gibbard s argument merit comment
 His conclusion is sound only by consent
If the only way to justify a duty is through the consent of the person bound by the duty then Mort must get Millie s consent if he is to justify his claim that she has a duty to refrain from using X But that is highly controversial
Most of us will acknowledge that we are bound by duties that do not stem from some initial act of consent on our part to that duty
Only by awkwardly slicing the concept of consent into various hypothetical and tacit modes can one render even remotely plausible the proposition that all justification is to be construed as issuing from consent
 But even if Gibbard is right even if consent alone justifies the imposition of duties he still has not demonstrated that there is anything especially problematic about duties to respect property
All moral duties would turn out to be contingent on obtaining the ongoing consent of people
Mort s liberty to speak his mind free of Millie s censorship requires her acquiescence as fully with an item of property in his possession
 A consent requirement for the existence of duties engenders anomalies in intergenerational transactions
Gibbard himself points out that one problematic aspect of his account of property rights is that new adults entering the moral community will enjoy disproportionate bargaining advantage
People live through different though overlapping periods of time
Now if anyone who has not agreed otherwise has a right to use things on the same basis as everyone else agreements made by others before a person was born to which he was not a party can not remove that right
When a child reaches adulthood when that is he first becomes competent to make agreements he has the same right to equal use of all things as he would have if everyone were in a state of nature
He can lose that fight only by agreeing to give it up
What happens then when a child first grows competent to make agreements If others have produced a very strong bargaining position
For abjuring his natural right to equal use of scarce goods such as cleared land stored food and housing the new adult can exact a high price 
Once again the talk of equal rights is confusing suggesting as it does that one agrees to give up a claim fight
But on the only plausible interpretation one gives up a liberty ie one accepts a duty
If the justification of moral duties requires that each new adult must consent to the entire moral code then a system of claim rights to property yields counterintuitive implications
However the implication concerning all other claim rights is similarly unpalatable new adults can exact a high price for their compliance
Their elders presumably have developed a settled way of life and expectations based on this code and would incur a considerable cost rather than give it up
So Mort Jr
can with good prospects of success put the following proposition to Mort Sr your property holdings in return for of same and if you throw in an additional I ll accept an obligation not to censor your speech or stone you for blasphemy
This we think stands as something of a reductio ad absurdum of the assumption that only the actual consent to a set of duties by each new moral citizen can justify such duties
""
Waldron on the Unilateral Creation of Obligations
Jeremy Waldron has recently voiced a criticism of property rights theories that shares much with Gibbard s complaints
According to Waldron a theory of justice in acquiring rights to property stipulates an action or a set of actions A such that anyone who performs A with respect to some resource ipso facto becomes the owner of the resource
 Such a theory then maintains that by performing some act A with respect to resource r Mort can unilaterally place the rest of the world under an obligation to refrain from using r That is Mort has added by some unilateral action of his own Waldron thinks that such a conception of obligation creation is unfamiliar and is distinctly uneasy about obligations that others might thrust on one in this way 
We find such obligations more familiar than does Waldron
Consider the obligation to render to people thatwhich they deserve
If Millie is the head of the philosophy department and Mort is an exceptional member of it his performance is apt to pile obligations on Millie
When it comes time to award merit increases approve leave applications etc she will find herself obligated to give Mort what he deserves
Thus through his own actions Mort generates obligations on Millie
One may think that this case is different
Mort and Millie are operating within a system to which both have consented
But have they Probably not
In any event the desert claims are embedded in an overall system that can be justified to both parties and that is why Mort s actions within No doubt
But surely this must be true of any plausible system of property rights as well
Individuals will through their unilateral actions exercise a moral power of altering others obligations with respect to items of property
That will be so only if the system within which they acquire use transform and convey holdings is itself morally justifiable but again we emphasize that this requirement of justifiability in no way distinguishes property rights from other liberal rights
One suspects that both Waldron and Gibbard think differently when they consider natural rights it seems that they suppose that these are rights that stand in no need of justification
If so one might properly doubt their existence
Restrictions impose costs on those so bound
It is flatly irrational to accede to the imposition of costs on oneself unless one has reason to acknowledge that doing so is justifiable
Certainly the declaration that suchandsuch a cost is natural is not to provide any such reason
If were simply unsupported assertions that others are bound because I have Thetaed then Waldron would be correct in criticizing the associated duties as suspicious and unfamiliar
But as should be clear by now all rights property or otherwise impose burdens and so stand in need of justification
If there is a clear sense to be made of property fights being less natural or more dependent on consent than are other liberal rights its source must be sought elsewhere
""
Convention and Consequentialism
There exists a persistent strand of the liberal tradition that ascribes to property rights a conventional status not shared by other liberal fights and concludes trax a justification of property rights will be informed by consequentialist considerations to an extent not true of other rights
Thus Larry Alexander writes
Rights to pursue one s projects can be no more than negative liberties to be free from having one s body labor and talents appropriated by others in pursuit of their projects
The rights to do not guarantee any resources outside of one s person
Any rights to act in and on the world in any way that competes with how others wish to act in and on the world must be rights derived from some impersonal consequentialist considerations 
Alexander maintains then that property rights are distinguished from other liberal rights in that the former but not the latter must pass the bar of consequentialist scrutiny
Society may establish at its discretion whatever rules and institutions of control over property that it deems conductive to overall value maximization it is restrained only at the periphory of persons bodies
We have already argued that it is implausible that individuals who maintain a special authority over their own persons and actions will have reason to cede all such authority concerning those external resources that constitute for them the requisites of action
The considerations of personal value that underlie one s normative authority over one s body labor and talents do not lose their salience when attention is shifted to items point however may be different
He may be taken as maintaining that there are a variety of societal forms through which recognition could be given to individuals interests in exercising control over external things
No one of these stands out as obviously correct ie natural in yet another sense of the term
Therefore it is reasonable that society adopt conventional norms of justice in holdings that promise to conduce to overall wellbeing understood as consequentialistic maximization
No doubt Alexander is correct in maintaining that property rights are conventional
One need only glance at a text on comparative property law or US statutes concerning patent and copyright to be made aware of the fact that socially acknowledged systems of rights to property are permeated through and through with artifice
However an equally brief glance at a compendium of Supreme Court decisions concerning the scope of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech reveals something very similar
One can not simply read off the pages of the Great Book of Nature that an flag or dancing nude in front of discriminating patrons of the arts is each protected speech over which the individual is properly sovereign but televised paeans to the Marlboro Man are prohibitable for the sake of the greater good
Nor is there anything obviously natural in the fact that freedom of speech extends to soundtrucks at political rallies in the park but not to those trucks when they appraoch a hospital
Rights all rights not just property rights are grounded in central human interests but take on the various particular form in which we observe them as a matter of convention
That is not to maintain that these conventional forms are arbitrary that one determination about the proper bounds of the exercise of speech or acquiring using and conveying property is as good as any other
Conventions themselves stand in need of justification in terms of how well or ill they conduce to the values they are intended to serve
However Alexander has provided no reason to suppose that this justification takes question are property rights or other liberal freedoms
Rather we maintain that property rights are to be understood as responsive to individuals interests in leading their lives according to their own lights amidst a world of other people who similarly have a fundamental interest in directing their lives in accord with their own values and projects
This is to adopt an essentially anticonsequentialistic view of justification with respect to all liberal rights
It may nonetheless seem that the conventions defining property rights are uniquely contestable in a way that other rights are not
Vast political movements arise and contend with one another over questions of how wealth is to be controlled moral philosophers who otherwise share a common commitment to liberal principles divide over whether property holdings are to be distributed in accordance with an equality criterion a difference principle or laissezfaire allowance of unrestricted acquisition
In the face of such diversity one is tempted to conclude that there is something up for grabs with respect to property rights that does not similarly characterize other liberal rights not as an entailment of the pure theory of rights but rather as a commentary on the history of liberalism
Many matters that moved people in previous generations to take up arms no longer sharply engage the passions and interests it is simply not an open question any longer Northern Ireland aside whether Papists are entitled to moral space within which they can give effect to their particular allegiances
Within at least the democratic West and in recent months within nascently democratic Central and Eastern Europe a substantial degree of consensus has been achieved concerning which activities fall within the protected sphere
It is important however that we overstate neither the extent nor the stability of such a consensus
Liberal toleration is not without enemies who contend against it both in mass political movements and in the scholarly literature
Nor is there anything in the logic of liberalism that generates the result say that one may permissibly elect to play golf on the Sabbath but not to ingest opiates
If might be both accidental and temporary
No conclusion should be drawn that property rights are either uniquely conventional or especially suited to TOOLONG parceling out
""
THE PROBLEM OF ORIGINAL ACQUISITION
""
The Oddness of Original Acquisition Arguments
Our analysis thus far has been negative insofar as we have argued that property rights do not significantly differ from other liberal rights with respect to both expanding the sphere of protected liberties that individuals can enjoy and requiring justification to the individuals so bound by them
Still the apprehension that the justification of property rights is somehow singular may remain
That apprehension itself calls for some diagnosis
Common to several of the arguments contending that property rights are anomalies within liberal theory is the suggestion that it is specifically the origins of a right to private property that are dubious
That is critics seem to concede that were a system of property rights satisfactorily inaugurated there would be little difficulty in understanding how holdings could properly be used transformed sold or given away we decide to trade them between ourselves nothing has occurred which strikes at the interests or moral standing of the rest of the world
However if I claim previously unowned apples and you claim previously unowned oranges we have thereby maintained against everyone else that they are no longer permitted to do with those apples and oranges that which they previously were at liberty to do
Thus it appears incumbent to offer an account of how rights to property can originate originate without requiring the general consent of everyone or a divine decree that people take what is needed from the state of nature so as to preserve themselves or a natural law of rightful appropriation that is selfjustifying
To this end philosophers offer arguments from original acquisition
There is something strange about these arguments
For most of the property we care about the story of its acquisition is ancient history at best and more likely ancient myth
Why the propriety of contemporary practices should be deemed to hinge on their dark nt it terribly odd to look into some remote past to see if our system of property is justifiable And can we ever know what we need to know Jeremy Waldron s questions are good ones
What were the conditions like when resources were first taken into ownership How well developed was moral consciousness Were those to whom the principle was supposed to apply capable of implementing it properly Could it conceivably have been a principle which they held and abided by explicitly Or in any way If we turn from ancient to modem capabilities how can we make sense now of principles whose only direct application was hundreds or perhaps thousands of years ago 
Arguments for private property based on a tale about original acquisition in longago times seem indeed to be a justificatory embarrassment
Why would a philosopher tell such a story
""
A Nonhistorical Reinterpretation of the OriginalAcquisition Arguments
Here is one possibility
Recall John Stuart Mill s claim that private property in every to individuals of the fruits of their own labour and abstinence
 We thus might say that the heart of a Millian defense of private property will be that property rights ensure producers the fruits of their labor Or we might say this is the telos of property rights If the telos of property rights is to assure to producers the fruits of their labor then the regulative idea in the justification of property rights is somehow to secure this link
Different systems may do so in different ways and some systems of property rights may seek to accomplish other aims besides
But if Mill is correct then any successful justification of property rights must center on securing this link between production and control
Now if this is one s view of property rights then the justification of a system of property rights must tie property rights to the act of producing
In some way or another that is it must be the case that the system of property fights generally provides producers
So on such accounts the case for a system of property rights will seek to demonstrate two things that a system of private property provides producers with control over the fruits of their labor and that an institution which establishes such a tie is justified
Both are required for the success of the Millian case for private property
A socialist for instance might accept but deny indeed it has been a common enough socialist complaint that a system of private property is a barrier to providing producers with control over the fruits of their labor
But suppose that someone denies 
Consider that is a critic who denies that there is any reason to accept an institution that grants producers such special control
How might one argue in favor of the institution Well one might endeavor to show that it is intuitively fitting that producers control their product by attempting to isolate this tie from the host And one way to do that is to imagine a world in which there were no other claims to resources
In such a state of nature we could focus on the claims that production generates without being distracted by preexisting claims over things
We could imagine people laboring on a world of unowned things and then note that in such a world it seems that a person who labors gains special claims over things such as acorns
And we might ask
When did they begin to be his When he digested Or when he eat Or when he boiled Or when he brought them home Or when he pickt them up And t is plain if the first gathering made them not his nothing else could
That labour put a distinction between them and common
That added something to them more than Nature the common Mother of all had done and so they became his private right 
The suggestion then is that the continuing influence of and thus emphasize the tie between labor andor production and the claim to control the fruits of labor
As David Miller a critic of Lockean property rights admits the tie between production and control over the fruits of labor does indeed seem most obvious in the simple fairly asocial conditions depicted in Locke s state of nature And that we suggest is a basic appeal of stateofnature originalacquisition stories they fix a spotlight on the intuition that producers deserve to own the fruits of their labor
So understood an original acquisition account of property need be no more historical than a political theory based on the concepts of the state of nature or the social contract
Although all three concepts appear to display a historical dimension and were probably understood by their early exponents as at least partially historical their contemporary appeal is not historical
Rather all three ie original acquisition the state of nature and the social contract are thought experiments that induce us to view justificatory
To be sure this probably was not Locke s intent
And Robert Nozick does indeed proffer an historical entitlement theory
But as Lawrence Becker points out a great deal of the continuing attraction of Locke s theory seems to stem from a conviction that it somehow embodies a principle of desert And indeed some have interpreted Locke s theory as basing property on desert claims Our reinterpretation of original acquisition arguments applies to these Lockeaninspired accounts
The crucial principle underlying these arguments is not essentially historical that at some faraway time someone appropriated a piece of property
Rather desertbased arguments are essentially nonhistorical they insist that the telos of a system of property rights is to link productive labor and control over goods
The tale about original acquisition functions to emphasize this telos
""
A Lingering Problem
As we said a Millian account of property rights must justify two claims that a system of private property provides producers with control over the fruits of the such a tie is justified
We have suggested that one way and the most interesting way an original acquisition tale functions is to justify the claim that workers deserve the fruits of their labor
But it is precisely here that original acquisition accounts of property seem to confront a justificatory challenge that distinguishes them from arguments for other liberal rights
Contrast 
A All who performed action Theta deserve right R
B All individuals in the polity are entitled to right R
It seems that arguments for liberal rights typically correspond to B they are universalistic in the sense that all individuals in the polity are entitled to rights of free speech association occupation and so forth
One does not have to do anything to earn such rights indeed that is one of the points of insisting that they are universal rights
But an argument for property based on desert conforms to A to simplify it asserts that only the productive or the hardworking properly merit rights do not Theta or who do not Theta very well accept the claim of Thetaers that Thetaers deserve special claims over resources Unlike freedom rights where liberals typically claim that everyone possesses the right Type A justifications of property do not necessarily suppose that all are Thetaers or equally good at Thetaing
The question thus arises how are Thetaers to justify their claims to nonThetaers
Perhaps Thetaers can show all others that everyone Thetaers and nonThetaers alike accept the appropriateness of giving say workers control over the fruits of their labors Or alternatively it might be shown that even nonThetaers benefit from a system that allows Thetaers special claims over resources
This we take it is one interpretation of Locke s famous claim echoed by Adam Smith that a King of a large and fruitful Territory in America where individual appropriation of land had not commenced feeds lodges and is clad worse than a day labourer in England
 The day to whom a property holder must justify himself the day laborer apparently does not obtain benefits from the system of private property
But if Locke and Smith are correct he does obtain benefits he the worst of in a society with private property is better off than the bestoff person in a state without appropriation
If so that does seem to be a reasonable if not conclusive justification of private property
Thus it seems that arguments making say production the grounds of property rights do indeed face a special justificatory problem they must justify the system of property rights to those uninterested in or unable to perform the relevant activity
This we suspect is the worry behind Gibbard s insistence on consent perhaps the producers need to obtain the consent of the nonproducers
And it is probably at the root of the unilateral feature of property claims that so troubles Waldron why should producers be able unilaterally to put nonproducers under obligations But the real problem rights of Thetaers to property must be justified to all on whom they impose moral demands
""
CONCLUSION
Do property rights pose a special justificatory problem We have argued in this paper that for the most part they do not
Most of the socalled special problems of property are simply particular cases of the general requirement that claim rights be justified to those on whom they impose obligations
We have shown that critics of liberal property rights typically hold these rights to be dubious because they stand in need of justification though these same critics elsewhere in relation say to free speech accept an equivalent justificatory requirement as unproblematic
We have however traced some of the purported special problems of property back to original acquisition arguments
The status of these arguments is not always pellucid but we have endeavored to provide an interpretation of originalacquisition narratives that plausibly represents them as raising some justificatory questions not encountered elsewhere in liberalism Property many have said rewards the industrious how able to take advantage of the opportunities presented by a regime of property rights But if that is the special problem that some liberal theories confront it hardly seems insuperable

The Problem
Property typically comes to us by transfer from previous owners
All property however eventually traces its existence as property to appropriations of previously unowned goods
So whether property can be justified apparenty depends on whether original approprition can be justified
Under what conditions then can removing natural resources from the commons be justified The standard answer is John Locke s
Labour being the unquestionable Property of the Labourer no Man but he can have a right to what that is once joyned to at least where there is enough and as good left in common for others
""
So the way to remove resources from the common stock is to mix one s labor with them thereby annexing them to one s person
A problematic idea to be sure but what interests me is how Locke qualifies it however one goes about removing goods from the commons one only unequivocally establishes title to those goods if one s
This qualification upon what one can originally extract from the commons is now known as the Lockean Proviso
Virtually no one to my knowledge believes that any particular act of initial appropriation in a world of scarcity stands much chance of satisfying the Lockean Proviso Judith Jarvis Thomson once put it this way
I suspect that there is no plausible construal of what Locke had in mind by enough and as good under which anyone s taking land for himself would leave enough and as good for all the other owners
For one thing Locke did not realize how large the class of owners was going to be
I therefore suspect that if we take leaving enough and as good as a necessary condition for property acquisition then it will follow that there can be no private ownership of land 
Jeremy Waldron concurs
If the enough and as good clause were a necessary condition on appropriation it would follow that in these circumstances by starvation and exposure of them all distribution by consent being ruled out practically and ex hypothesi since no appropriation would leave enough and as good in common for others 
Likewise Rolf Sartorious says this Understood as an original limitation on the right to appropriate natural resources the condition that there be enough and as good left for others could not of course be literally satisfied by any system of private property rights
""
We compound the problem as John T Sanders explains if we suppose quite reasonably that the Proviso requires us to leave something for our children as well as for each other
In particular if you consider all future generations and if you must leave enough and as good for every future human being then it is hard to imagine that the Proviso would allow you to mix your labor with much more than an infinitesimal slice of land
""
The views of Thomson Waldron Sartorius and Sanders come political philosophy ever get
John Arthur adds that if one approaches the problem of resource acquisition from the perspective of the Lockean proviso that enough and as good must be left in common then the typical method of acquiring property under capitalism is unjust
""
If Arthur is right the implications are farreaching indeed
If no initial acquisitions at all can be legitimate private holdings are illegitimate in principle
A stolen bicycle even if it were freely given to you by a generous thief is not yours to keep the illegitimate step in the process casts a shadow across all subsequent transactions
An illegitimate original acquisition would similarly infect all subsequent transfers
""
Sanders takes a similar view of the issue s significance
That some initial claim to property be defensible is required by any theory that holds that certain present distributions may be justified that certain transfers of property are justified or that restitution ought to be made for previous injustice in transfer or acquisition is crucial to the remainder of property theory 
The apparent impossibility of satisfying the Proviso then has genuinely startling implications
Private property moreover is only one of many institutions whose legitimacy is called into question by this line of argument
The appropriation of land by worker communes is subject to the same objection
Likewise reserving a campsite in a crowded national park also fails to leave enough and as good for others as does the use of public property in general when such property is subject to rationing or crowding
Restrictions on immigration are problematic for the same reason by instituting them we fail to leave enough and as good for those who as a result find themselves on the outside looking in
The above institutions are all ways of establishing control over territory
In particular they establish the power and assume the right to restrict access to territory to which access had once been unrestricted which is to say that they remove such territory from the commons
appropriates acquires etc goods from the commons by establishing control over them in particular establishing the power to exclude others from consuming those goods
If private property falls to the objection that original appropriation can not be justified it falls as a method of restricting access to the commons and all methods of restricting access to the commons fall along with it
Unless we are willing to admit that no such institutions can be legitimate we seem forced to dismiss the Proviso as at best a sufficient but not necessary condition on appropriation that being impossible to satisfy should be ignored
Indeed Sanders has a powerful argument that ignoring it is exactly what we should do 
Against the idea that we should ignore the Proviso consider that in proposing the Proviso Locke is already retreating from the usual criterion of legitimate property transfer which requires that transactions be consensual
The retreat is necessary because a wouldbe original appropriator can not obtain the prior consent of previous owners before are no previous owners
Nor does anyone have the kind of claim to the resource that prior owners would have so there is no reason to suppose that anything as strong as prior consent is normatively required to legitimize original appropriation
Yet Locke was right to think something must be done to justify original appropriation for such appropriation seizes exclusive control over that to which others previously had unrestricted access
Especially under conditions of scarcity such seizures have to be justified
Locke is also basically on target in specifying the nature of the required justification that is one should not appropriate goods from the commons without stopping to consider what one is leaving for others
Robert Nozick agrees saying that any adequate theory of justice in acquisition will contain something like the Proviso The trouble is as J H Bogart says under conditions of scarcity every acquisition worsens the lot of others and worsens their lot in relevant ways
 The problem with the Proviso is that contrary than the requirement that one obtain the prior consent of others
Both appear to be tests that original appropriation can not possibly pass
Suppose it really is necessary for original appropriation to satisfy the Proviso
Would justifying original appropriation be possible I think so
Moreover I do not think it becomes harder for original appropriation to satisfy the Proviso as goods become more scarce
In fact I will argue that far from never permitting us to remove goods from the commons the Proviso may sometimes require us to remove scarce goods from the commons
I do not claim that Locke himself intended the Proviso to be read as I will read it
Nevertheless I beleive the Proviso should be read this way for this reading captures a crucial truth about the conditions under which property is legitimate

Apples
A group of us find ourselves instantiated in a valley full of various kinds of apple trees some already bearing ripe fruit
Finding ourselves hungry we commence picking and eating so as other trees begin to ripen a few of us jump the gun and pick the best apples before they are quite ripe and the rest of us rush in fearing that we will otherwise lose out entirely
Things get worse and eventually we find ourselves picking fruit before it is really edible
If we do not someone else will snatch it first and by the smallest of margins we would rather have little green apples tha none at all
Tired of this degrading affair and of being underfed one of us builds a fence around a single blossoming tree
None of the rest of us pays much attention to her until the day approaches when her tree being the only tree we have yet to prematurely ravage will bear the only ripe apples in the valley
There are those of us who think about killing her in her sleep
But there are others who decide that her idea was a good one and follow suit while there is still time of us in groups claim plots jointly adopting various ways of sharing the costs and benefits of joint management
The details of our arrangements are not important here for the task at hand is to justify original appropriation in general rather than to justify any particular kind of property institution
""
Then Group II comes along
They find some trees fenced off bearing lots of ripe fruit
The rest of the trees have been destroyed
We tore them down trying to eat the bark
Group II approaches the fencedoff trees and
asks us where Group II s trees are
We say there are no trees for Group II
Group II says But we are hungry
We say No problem
Grab those old dead trees over there and make fenceposts
We ll trade apples for them
Group I says All right but there are many groups yet to come
There are nt enough apples to feed them all
famine is like we begin to tremble a bit
Well except for the original fence builder that is
She is thinking about the new fencepost industry and how it will facilitate the reclamation and rehabilitation of land for agricultural use
The end of our story finds her busy collecting apple seeds
The moral of the story is this
As latecomers arrive and natural resources become scarce anything left in the commons will be levelled
This much is not news at least not to readers of Garrett Hardin What really is news is this leaving goods in the commons fails to satisfy the Proviso
In fact leaving goods in the commons practically ensures their ruin
The essence of the Tragedy of the Commons what makes it tragic is precisely that not enough and as good is left for others
As a necessary condition for satisfying the Proviso goods must be removed from the commons
Moreover the more severe the scarcity the faster resources will be destroyed in will require that resources be removed from the commons
Needless to say there is more than one institutional framework that can effectively remove goods from the commons ranging from private property to public property to national borders
For present purposes this makes no difference
We are not trying to decide which institutions are most effective or even which are justified but only that the establishment of exclusive control which they all presume can be justified
At any rate there is no incentive to nurture apple trees in the commons
In the commons the fruits of production so to speak belong to others as much as to oneself
If one does not want to starve one is better off spending one s time eating while one can rather than producing
If only we had the power to decide how everyone will act
There might not be any point in removing resources from the commons
We could satisfy the Proviso by choosing for everyone to abide by principles ourselves not for everyone
And what people should choose for themselves differs from what would be right and from what the Proviso would require if they were choosing for everyone
What does this general point imply about the commons The commons might never be levelled if we could choose for everyone to leave enough and as good for others but the fact that people choose for themselves makes a difference to what counts as leaving enough and as good for others
To decide that everyone will leave a piece of land alone would be to protect it to decide to leave it alone oneself is merely to leave it unprotected
In the commons we could naively restrain ourselves waiting our turn and then eating only our share
But it would nt help
Those who do otherwise will still precipitate the tragedy of the commons
Our only choices in this unfolding tragedy would be these join in the mad rush to mutual starvation refuse to join the rush and be the first rhetorically and otherwise
Only if some people successfully implement the latter choice is there any chance of the Proviso being satisfied
Are those who initially catalyze this mad rush doing something wrong Of course in particular they are violating the Proviso
But whether their actions are right or wrong is not really the point
The point is that until access to the land is restricted people will have the opportunity and the incentive to overuse it and some of them as a matter of fact will overuse it thereby not leaving enough and as good for others
A moral agent has to take this into account when deciding how to go about ensuring that there will be something left for her children
And simply allowing the commons to go to ruin at the hands of other foragers most emphatically is not the way to ensure that something will be left for her children
If one is to satisfy the Proviso in a way that has some positive bearing on the preservation of mankind one as it applies to things like apples ie food
But if one merely appropriates apples one is not satisfying the Proviso with respect to apples
Those who appropriate apples from the commons violate the Proviso on any interpretation of it insofar as it pertains to apples
They generate the tragedy of the commons
Since appropriating apples ignores the Proviso with respect to apples the tragedy created by those who appropriate apples alters what the Proviso means as a constraint on appropriations of land
In other words some alteration of the rules of access to apples is necessary if the Proviso with respect to apples is to be satisfied
The Proviso itself drives us to make this alteration and so our interpretation of the Proviso must reflect the fact that it drives us to alter the rules of access to apples ie to restrict access to apples
Specifically to appropriate land is to restrict access to apples
And restricted access to apples tends somewhat paradoxically to be a precondition Proviso with respect to apples one must appropriate land rather than apples
Hence land appropriation is not a violation of the Proviso given that the Proviso applies first and foremost to food under those circumstances but must instead be required by it
I will say more about the Proviso with respect to land at the end of the following section
""
Assumptions
Two assumptions I made in deriving this conclusion are worth discussing
First in requiring that enough and as good be left for others I take the Proviso to be referring to future generations as well as to the present one
As Sanders puts it What possible argument could at the same time require that the present generation have scruples about leaving enough for one another while shrugging off such concern for future generations 
Locke thought the point of property was that it helped preserve mankind which he undoubtedly meant to include future generations
This does not mean Locke also intended the Proviso s reference to the suggestion is surely a strong one
Moreover if Locke did not think of the Proviso as protecting future generations he should have and so should we
If we aspire to preserve mankind leaving something for our own generation is not enough
The land must be saved for future generations too
As scarcity rears its ugly head a given generation s preservation of the land for future generations discharges its obligation to satisfy the Proviso in the only way that matters in the long run
And if we latecomers ourselves after all do not leave resources for the next generation we must somewhere along the line be failing to leave resources for others whether or not we read others as being defined in terms of future generations
This is why I have insisted that the Proviso not only permits original appropriation which is a significant point in itself but actually requires it
One might suppose that the Proviso does not literally require original appropriation because lie down and die
Perhaps this is right but if the intent of the Proviso is to regulate original appropriation in such a way as to be conducive to the preservation of mankind then obeying it simply by dying misses the Proviso s point
That is not to say members of the first generation will not sometimes rightly feel disadvantaged by appropriations of their contemporaries perhaps even to the point where they wish their contemporaries would lie down and die
Nevertheless she who removes the first plot of land from the commons is doing something the Proviso requires to be done by somebody because again trees left in common are subject to ruinous overuse by those who do not care or can not afford to care given the logic of the commons about leaving enough and as good for others
If someone objects that he would rather have met that requirement himself she can answer You re objecting to my doing something that had to be done by someone
to do it and I picked me
You would have picked you which would have been similarly unobjectionable
But that is nt how it happened
""
He might well respond that he is nt objecting to her act of appropriation he s objecting to the way she distributed what she appropriated or the fruits thereof Perhaps his argument is sound but in any event since his objection is not against the removal as such we have no quarrel with him here
He concedes our point that people must acquire goods to be able to save them for future generations
We concede his point that once one acquires goods there are limits on what one can do with one s acquisitions
For present purposes we leave open the possibility that among such limits are those pertaining to redistribution
Moreover if population pressure is already severe enough to limit relative latecomers opportunities even in the first generation that means population pressure will limit their opportunities whether or not appropriation is a living is a disappointment foraging the commons elbow to elbow would hardly be a picnic
Whether or not appropriation is allowed relative latecomers all find themselves in the same position whatever generation they belong to either the land has already been appropriated or that which has not been appropriated can not be appropriated and is probably on the way to ruin
But when some of the land has been appropriated at least relative latecomers can hope to secure the opportunity to use land land that remains useful by trading their labor for it
Those who appropriate land can see to it that something is left for the future by assuming responsibility for the land which means assuming the right to prevent those who would overuse it from doing so
Those who merely appropriate apples perform no such service
The Proviso it should be noted is a principle of justice pertaining to original acquisition not to rectifying past injustice
The original situation is not fair and appropriating land does not appropriating land does not make it fair either
Those who show up late in the race to appropriate land typically have little reason to suppose they would have done better by showing up similarly late in the race to appropriate apples from the commons
On the contrary since the prizes tend to be so much smaller in the commons they typically would do that much worse
That they have shown up late through no fault of their own is something to consider when distributing prizes
In contrast that they find themselves in the first kind of race rather than the second is something for which they should simply be thankful
My second assumption concerns exactly what it is that must be left for future generations
As our story goes protecting Group II s interests does not require that apples or trees or land be left in common for Group II to build fences around but that the source of apples be preserved so that Group II will have something to eat
And it is a good for Group II
When that which is scarce is left in the commons it will be overused
To ensure that something worth having will be left for Group II someone in the first group has to build fences around it
My second assumption then is that what future generations need is resources to use
They do not need resources to initially acquire
Again this seems to be Locke s intention more importantly it should be ours as well
Latecomers arrive too late to acquire valuable land by original appropriation
If what is important is leaving resources for use then leaving resources for original appropriation is not necessary
Thus leaving land in the commons is not necessary
In fact it is imperative not to leave land in the commons given what will happen to it there
Sooner or later the only land worth having will be previously appropriated land
Therefore the Proviso can not be thought of as providing for the preservation of opportunities to appropriation of land inevitably leaves less land in common for others to appropriate it must at least violate the Proviso with respect to land even if violating the Proviso in this respect is necessary if one is to satisfy the Proviso with respect to apples
Carol Rose for instance concedes that To be sure any appropriation diminishes to some tiny degree the amount of a resource that is available to others
 But this concession is a crucial mistake
It is not true that appropriation of land inevitably decreases the amount of land available to others
It only inevitably decreases what is available for original appropriation by others which is not the same thing at all Thus appropriation of land is not only required by the Proviso with respect to apples but is also permitted by the Proviso with respect to land

Contemporary Holdings
Thomas Mautner argues that theories of original appropriation have no contemporary relevance Why not Because even if we produce a workable criterion of just original appropriation were acquired in accordance with that criterion
But as a matter of fact the histories of contemporary holdings are generally laced with episodes of force and fraud
Nor does Mautner think a theory of original appropriation would help in deciding how to rectify historical injustices and I follow him in this respect
""
Mautner s point is welltaken but my admittedly idiosyncratic reading of the Proviso has a contemporary relevance that Mautner did not anticipate
First an obvious point Even today many resources are still largely held in common
To give one example the coral reefs of the Philippine and Tongan islands are currently being ravaged by destructive fishing techniques
Where fishermen once used lures and traps they now pour bleach ie sodium hypochlorite into the reefs
Partially asphyxiated the fish float to the surface and become easy prey
Unfortunately the coral itself suffocates along with the fish and the dead reef ceases to be a viable habitat
Blastfishing also widely practiced What goes through the minds of these fishermen as they reduce some of the most beautiful habitats in the world to rubble Perhaps some of them think quite correctly that if they do not destroy a given reef it will shortly be destroyed by someone else so they might as well be the ones to catch the fish
Various groups are trying to save the reefs by effectively removing them from the commons makng other groups very angry in the process The issue of how such appropriation might be justified is of contemporary relevance if anything is
Moreover my interpretation of the Proviso implies that preserving the ecology of the reefs should be regarded as the pivotal issue which seems right on the mark to me
Second and perhaps less obviously my argument also bears on resources that were appropriated long ago because it does more than show that things could have worked out so that original appropriation and subsequent history would have been legitimate even though it actually turned out otherwise
Justifying holdings of course
Nevertheless justifying original appropriation does have the following critically important implication one can not in blanket fashion base claims of historical injustice on the a priori argument that current holdings must after all have been originally acquired somewhere along the line
On the contrary claims of historical injustice must refer to the actual historical records of particular extant holdings
Third my argument suggests that there is a sense in which the Proviso has justificatory significance over and above the role it plays as a criterion of just original appropriation
Consider that although removing goods from the commons is necessary if goods are to be preserved for future generations it is not sufficient for original appropriation by itself does not guarantee that goods will be preserved for future generations
In other words original appropriation is required to satisfy the Proviso and this fact suffices to justify original appropriation
But it does not suffice to justify any and all the ways in which one s holdings might be used fail to satisfy the Proviso insofar as it pertains to the use of resources rather than to their initial acquisition
I will call this sense of the Proviso the useproviso to stress the change of topic
We have been talking about the justification of property as an outgrowth of legitimate original appropriation
The useproviso in contrast concerns the justification of property as a vehicle for preserving resources for the future The useproviso s satisfaction requires that those who appropriate resources also practice in some sense ecologically sound management
Satisfying the useproviso would mean that regardless of what has happened in the past an owner could claim that her holdings are being properly cared for and will still be there for future generations when she dies
The useproviso s justificatory weight however much it has may be used to criticize as well as to defend current holdings For renewable resources like forests and generally for resources that can be effectively used without being destroyed like park land one ought to when one found it
For resources like oil that can not be effectively used without destroying them this requirement would be too strong
After all for goods that can only be consumed once someone will eventually have to deal with their already having been consumed
So distant generations can not have the same claims to nonrenewable resources as proximate ones
At most they will be able to point out that such resources should be replaced by something as good and not necessarily the same kind of resource
Of course this leaves us with the problem of deciding what as good amounts to
One problem with this is that one person might claim while chopping down redwoods to make room for a hamburger franchise that he is leaving enough and as good for others when everyone else agrees he is simply spoiling his land
In a similar vein we might ask If a person is inclined not to leave enough and as good for others when in the commons as good when it comes to his own property Undoubtedly a few owners will care so little about the future that they will ruin their own land despite the loss to themselves of its future value
And some Tongan fishermen given ownership of a reef might prefer to destroy its future productivity for the sake of maximizing a onetime harvest despite the fact that they will then be left with nothing
Nevertheless this lamentable folly is no reason for the rest of us to give such people the opportunity to ravage everything by leaving it all in the commons
That they ruin their own property is bad enough
Consider also that in the commons people have comparatively little incentive to save the land even if they do care about their future
Even those Tongan fishermen who would like to save the reefs for their children continue to dynamite and poison the reefs because as long as the reefs remain in commons they do not have the option of choosing between longrun and shortrun for themselves and shortrun gains for whoever shows up next
Exclusive control over a stream of benefits gives us reason to maximize that stream s longrun value
Once we lose control over this stream our incentive is to maximize the immediate value we can extract
This also holds if the future we care about is mankind s rather than our own
The property we save from ourselves can be preserved by us as we see fit but the commons we save belongs to everyone and is subject to ruination by others whether or not we save it from ourselves
When one has control over a parcel of land its future and one s own are bound together as tightly as possible and this arrangement makes the most of whatever tendencies one has to care about the future
Admittedly fencing the commons is not a panacea
People sometimes ruin their own property
Sometimes an injunction to care for it properly is needed But this is no reason to regret that the property has been the property is controlled by some identifiable party then at least there is some identifiable party who can be held responsible for it
There is some person or group on whom the needed injunction can be served
""
Conclusions
A key problem for the liberal theory of property concerns the justification of initial acquisiton of resources from the common stock
My argument does not settle questions of comparison among alternative property institutions but it does settle that institutions of exclusive control in general are immune to the sweeping objection that the initial acquisition of property can not be justified by the lights of he Proviso
In establishing this my argument rebuts an argument often levelled against private property but which applies equally to institutions for establishing exclusive control in general
If we should leave enough and as good for others we should above all leave enough and as good for future generations
To leave enough and as good for future generations we must above all protect them from presentday commons tragedies
Removing resources from what we must preserve for future generations are opportunities to use resources not opportunities to originally appropriate them
This must be so because under conditions of scarcity if we want resources to be there for future generations leaving resources in the commons for them to remove on their own is out of the question
My interpretation of the Proviso far from ruling out original appropriation actually requires it
David Schmidtz
Yale University
In this essay I seek to advance the philosophical defense of private property ie of private holdings of extrapersonal objects The defense proposed vindicates holdings as matters of rights
I argue that each person has a natural right to the practice of private property which consists in a right that all others abide by a system of rules under which individuals may peacefully acquire transform and otherwise exercise exclusive and discretionary control over extrapersonal objects
There are no natural rights to specific extrapersonal objects or to any share of such objects
Rather particular entitlements to extrapersonal holdings arise through the performance of those actions designated as entitlementconferring by the system of rules to which individuals have natural rights
As individuals are bound to comply with the rules constituting the practice of private property they are bound to respect the particular entitlements that arise within that practice I attempt to show how the natural right of property and in turn the specific entitlements to holdings that arise under the institutionalization of that right fit within My argument in this essay like all moral argument about property does not stand on its own
Rather it rests on more basic philosophical considerations in this case on a foundational argument for natural rights only a sketch of which can be presented here
I shall proceed in the following manner
First I shall outline the main contentions of those more basic philosophical inquiries
Second I shall introduce motivate and characterize a rightsbased version of classical liberalism which I shall then simply refer to as classical liberalism
This classical liberalism in essence combines a doctrine of selfownership with an endorsement of entitlementconferring procedures which sanction the division of the extrapersonal world into private domains
While the selfownership component is presented as a consequence of the philosophical inquiries described in section I at this early stage of exposition the sanctioning of the division of the extrapersonal world into private domains is presented simply as a natural extension or concomitant of the selfownership component
Third I shall characterize Act theories theories
Fourth I shall criticize the general adequacy of Act theories of private property
Fifth I shall motivate characterize and defend the Practice theory of private property including its incorporation of the truths normally resident within Act theories 
Act theories and the Practice theory represent alternative strategies for justifying private property within the classical liberal perspective
Act theories support the coherence of classical liberalism by depicting entitlements to private holdings as arising solely through the exercise of selfownership or some aspect of selfownership
The Practice theory supports the coherence of classical liberalism by founding entitlements to private holdings in part on the exercise of selfownership but more importantly in part on a companion natural right of property which shares a philosophical base with selfownership
If this essay advances the program of a rightsbased classical liberal account of private property in extrapersonal objects it does so through its development of the contrast between Act and Practice theories and in its further elucidation and defense of the Practice theory From the point of view of high drama theory does not make its full appearance until the fifth section of this essay

AgentRelativity and SelfOwnership
I have argued elsewhere for a version of moral individualism that displays two distinct yet interconnected facets The first facet is the agentrelativity of value
What is of value what provides individuals with goaloriented reasons for action is essentially personally individuated
A given end E will be valuable with regard to Alice will provide Alice with a goaloriented reason to maintain or promote E only if it stands in a certain necessary indexical relation to Alice eg the relation of being the fulfillment of her preference being her pleasure being a realization of her potential or being the continuation of her life
Since value arises and exists within such relations of particular agents with specific ends it is the agent within that relation for whom those ends are valuable for whom those ends provide goaloriented reasons of value for action
Hence from E s being valuable with regard to Alice from E it does not follow in the least that E is valuable as such ie is agentneutrally valuable or that in virtue of such agentneutral value Alan has any reason to maintain or promote E or even to abstain from destroying it
Any E s being of value for Alice in itself provides no reason at least no reason of a goaldirected sort for Alan to maintain or promote or even not to destroy E Of course in special circumstances there may be some overlap in the ends including the most basic ends that are of value to Alice and Alan
They may each take nonrivalrous pleasure in the local band s performance of Sousa marches and have reason even cooperatively to promote these events But within any largescale pluralist society the special sharing of goals that exists among particular individuals and groups will not even begin to provide the basis for goalbased rules or prescriptions having general interpersonal force across that society
On the contrary the agentrelativity of values which people owe allegiance and in the name of which the behavior of individuals may legitimately be bent molded or constrained
For any notion of the social good which is not merely an appeal to fantastic organicism must be constructed by aggregating combining ranking or otherwise depersonalizing the separate and variegated goods of particular individuals
But no such combinatory process makes sense among the incommensurable agentrelative values of individuals
The costs imposed on Alice to advance a human good realized in the life of Alan is not furthermore a cost that advances some agentneutral goal such as the maximization of aggregate utility or the greatest possible enhancement of the less well endowed social position for which Alice as a rational or moral agent should be prepared to pay
The denial of morally authoritative common goals which each person as a rational or moral agent has reason to promote frees individuals from the threat of the justified subordination of their lives and capacities to the promotion of such conceptions of the good
Unfortunately from all moral constraint on their behavior towards others in the course of their respective pursuit of personal ends
I argue however that this is mere appearance
For there is another connected facet of moral individualism
To affirm the agentrelativity of value is to acknowledge each person as having ultimate ends of his own as possessing distinctive ends for his person to which he rationally ought to devote the elements which compose his personal constitution
But to acknowledge such distinctive ends for each person is to remove each person from the realm of mere things that have no rational purposes of their own and that are therefore morally available for exploitation by other purposive beings
As an endinhimself in the sense of possessing his own distinctive and separate lifepurposes each agent is also an endinhimself in the sense of not being a means to the purposes of others
The recognition of others as reasonbearing and valuepursuing beings on a moral par with oneself does not then require allegiance to their good nor somehow to be constructed out of everyone s incommensurable values
The rational recognition of others takes instead the form of deontic constraints on one s liberty to use others
Respect for sideconstraints on one s permissible treatment of others is the way in which in one s practical relations to others one can recognize the value and importance of their projects and ends without incorporating them into one s own plan of life or factoring them along with all others projects and ends into some unified and common end Morally speaking to be a selfowner is to possess moral authority over one s personal constitution ie over those features components or aspects of one s personal existence the rational goal of which is the advancement of one s lifedefining purposes
The components of one s personal constitution which one has reason to devote to one s good defines the moral domain over which one has natural jurisdiction
Thus the practical recognition of others as moral equals with oneself with separate ends of their of each as a selfowner as a being with a special moral jurisdiction over the person he is
This is the initial key claim of moral individualism s theory of the right
Alice can never provide other agents at large with reason to respect her possession and control of any extrapersonal object by pointing out that this respect is conducive to her good ie that she has reason to want that possession respected
The value for her of that possession may be real however it fails to command the compliance of others
On the other hand were she credibly able to invoke an authoritative common end which is served by her possession then respect for her possession would indeed be imperative
But no such invocation is credible
As things stand then if Alice has a claim to some extrapersonal object which is good against the world it can not be in virtue of either the agentrelative or the agentneutral value of her possession of it
Rather her claim must take the form with her peaceful enjoyment of that object
And this right if there is such a right must represent a portion of the recognition all other agents owe her as a separate reasonbearing and valuepursuing being on a moral par with themselves

RightsBased Classical Liberalism
The core of classical liberalism is the assertion of selfownership or some kindred right protective of the individual in his life and liberty along with the idea that this right codifies at least part of the constraint on behavior that each individual may demand of others in recognition of his status as a moral endinhimself
Moreover the motivation that champions robust individual rights in persons also seems to support a comparable division of the extrapersonal world into discrete domains each of which will lie but not inalienably within the moral jurisdiction of some particular person or perhaps some particular coalition of persons
For such a division allows extrapersonal material to be secured to serve the purposes of individual agents in the same fashion as the ascription to each of a his natural endowments in the service of his ends
Certainly both of the philosophical giants of a natural rights classical liberalism ie Locke and Kant were firm advocates of rightsbased immunities against seizure and interference with regard to both the individual person and his property
In the case of Locke of course private property rights are grounded in in virtue of arising through the exercise of each person s right to his own labor which itself is an aspect of each individual s selfpropriety In Kant the rights over one s own person and to private property have a common grounding in a right to equal freedom 
Of course the sovereignty of each over himself secures for individuals inventories of personal resources that may be highly unequal
Joe s geneticallybased bulging biceps may radically outclass Wilbur s tiny triceps while Joan s native intense intelligence may comparably outdistance Wilma s wandering wit
The morally protected natural endowments of each need not jointly satisfy any privileged pattern or ratio
Similarly for the seems natural and inoffensive that the division of extrapersonal materials among persons also need not satisfy any sanctified pattern or ratio We should though guard against the assumption that there will be any systematic correspondence between proportionate shares of personal endowments and of extrapersonal endowments
Or if there turns out to be a systematic correspondence it may be only because what retrospectively counts as valuable shares of personal endowments are precisely those endowments which turn out to facilitate the attainment of extrapersonal resources
Just as the formal equality of selfownership may be satisfied without each selfowner possessing a personal endowment sufficient even minimally to advance his purposes so too the envisioned division of the world of extrapersonal materials need not guarantee each individual materials sufficient even minimally to enhance his life 
Thus fightsbased classical liberalism has the following defining features
 It is rightsbased ie the fundamental legally enforceable constraints are those demanded by individuals rights and these rights themselves represent an interpersonal recognition of the separate moral importance of founded upon any sort of transindividual overall social value
 It endorses a doctrine of moral selfownershipof each person s moral jurisdiction over himself or some functionally equivalent or near equivalent right such as a right against interference with one s person
 It takes all particular rights to extrapersonal objects to arise through the performance of specific entitlementconferring actions
It may be maintained that the entitlementconferring actions are simply exercises of selfownership or its functional equivalent or some aspect of selfownership or its functional equivalent
Or alternatively it may be maintained that the entitlementconferring activities are those actions that confer titles within a practice of private property to which each individual has a right
This corresponds to the division between Act theories and the Practice theory
""
 As follows from and is presupposed by classical liberalism takes the world of natural extrapersonal objects to be initially morally up for grabs ie to be itself thoroughly naturally unowned such fall within the respective moral domains of the persons whose components and powers they are no element of the natural world is as such morally attached to any individual
Those moral attachments are instead produced by specific entitlementconferring actions
 In virtue of its endorsement of selfownership classical liberalism operates with a strong presumption against any doctrine that asserts or implies that some people have natural rights to the products of other people s efforts and endeavors
For it takes such a right to the products and hence the efforts and endeavors of others to clash fundamentally with selfownership

SelfOwnership and Act Theories of Private Property
In the course of characterizing feature of classical liberalism I have cited two alternative conceptions of the basis of private entitlements in extrapersonal objects
According to one these entitlements arise simply through various exercises of selfownership while according to the other conception these entitlements arise through actions in accordance with the rules and procedures defining a practice of companion to the natural right of persons over themselves
One might then proceed in terms of a distinction between the SelfOwnership Exercise theory and the SelfOwnership Companion theory
But putting matters in these terms would not do much to capture and convey the differences between the structures of the two strategies and the rationale for the latter strategy
It will in the end be better to have advanced more slowly to the Act versus Practice characterization of these alternatives
I turn therefore to an account of Act theories of entitlements to extrapersonal holdings
There are two main reasons for providing this material
One reason is to get some sense of what truths there are to be gleaned from Act theories for incorporation into any justifiable practice of private property
The second reason is to begin to build the case for going beyond Acts theories to the Practice theory which asserts that there must be within classical liberalism a distinct natural right of property which supplements selfownership
Act theories of entitlements to extrapersonal objects seek to account for or some set of exercises of selfownership or some functionally equivalent primary right or the exercise of some aspect of selfownership
Each present rightholder exercises his selfownership in a certain way and this exercise extends his moral jurisdiction over some extrapersonal object
The agent s moral jurisdiction is extended by his action because his action extends the agent s vulnerability to the violation of his selfownership
Each such entitlement is subject to a separate and selfcontained vindication
Did the putative rightholder exercise his selfownership by transforming creating initiating the use of etc this extrapersonal object Does the putative rightholder s action thereby extend his moral jurisdiction to the actedupon object If the answers are affirmative interference with or seizure of the object has the quality of violating the agent s selfownership and in virtue of this the agent is entitled to the object
The paradigmatic version of the Act approach is the Lockean labor theory of property or more specifically the Lockean labor theory of just initial acquisition with respect to extrapersonal property is ascribed to all persons
In the Lockean case of course it is the right of each to his own labor which itself is an implication of each person s selfpropriety
This internal right provides or is supposed to provide a conduit for individual right to enter the external world
In the Lockean paradigm an individual may exercise his right over his own labor and thereby mix his labor with extrapersonal material
Since the labor is invested and not merely dissipated the resulting transformed object now contains something the agent s labor which is still morally attached to the agent
For others now to seize this object would be for them to seize the labor that has been mixed with it
Since seizing the agent s labor would violate his general right to his own labor seizing the transformed object now violates the laborer s rights
Thus original rights to such transformed segments of the extrapersonal world are externalizations of persons basic internal rights
The numerous candidates for this sort of bridgebuilding between internal rights and the extrapersonal world
Another prominent candidate is the right to liberty construed as a right against interference in the disposition of one s body talents energies and so on
Under this alternative the crucial bridging act would not be the mixing of one s labor but rather the deployment of one s liberty through the use of extrapersonal objects so that one s liberty is now hostage to others nonseizure of those objects The crucial bridging claim would be that the seizure of an object which one is using in ongoing purposive activities constitutes a violation of one s right to liberty
Much less is said by Act Theorists about nonoriginal private property rights ie about rights arising through or being conveyed by voluntary transfer
The characteristic theme of Act Theories is perhaps most fully retained in conceptions of legitimate transfer in which the prior owner in effect vacates ownership while at the same time the new owner s acquisition constitutes a new is established
Thus the prior owner Paul vacates perhaps to begin with in a way that allows only his chosen successor Sally to commence her rightsestablishing act permissibly while Sally by her investment of her labor or by the incorporation of the object in her ongoing purposive activity brings about a new externalization of the internal right to her own labor or the internal right against interference with her person and activities
Rights as such are never transferred nor does the prior owner s transfer of the holding to his successor as such bestow a right upon the latter which is a moral descendant of the original right
Rather the prior owner Paul s function is merely to restore his holding to the state of nature albeit to restore it selectively so that third parties remain morally constrained not to appropriate the object before successor Sally established a new original right to it
Any such reenactment conception of just transfers in effect closes the gap between principles of initial acquisition and of transfer since essentially the same sorts owned objects
Any particular reenactment principle of just transfers will of course be no more plausible than the corresponding principle of initial acquisition
But give eg the labor or liberty principles of initial acquisition the cognate reeenactment principles are not terribly farfetched at least for transfers that are exchanges
In the case of a labor reeenactment doctrine the claim will be that the labor present in the service or invested in the object that Sally offers for the purpose of exchange combined with the labor Sally invests in arranging or participating in the exchange is the labor permissibly invested by her in her newly acquired holding
Exchange transmits investment from the object surrendered to the object thereby purchased
In the case of a liberty reenactment doctrine the claim will simply be that an exchange constitutes a permissible substitution of objects in use in ongoing projects and that the project itself may be the achievement of advantageous ie valueenhancing substitutions
Having permissibly and purposively acquired the object from Paul it the service of Sally s plans
In contrast reenactment principles must handle gift transfers somewhat less well
For gift transfers by their nature require less action on the part of the recipient
Still perhaps what little any recipient must do to acknowledge receipt of a gift can be construed as a minimal permissible reenactment of the property generating act
Furthermore surely something can be said about the giftgiver s moral power to convey to or otherwise establish in the recipient of his gift an entitlement to that object
And presumably whatever can be said will also apply to the seller s moral power to convey titles
Suppose that Paul already has title to object O and is willing to convey O to Sally so as to establish both her possession and title to O It seems that this must make it easier for Sally to acquire title to O or must provide Sally with a different way of acquiring title to O than if Paul did not have title of O and was could toward her acquisition of unowned O A major point in having a right over an object is to have a determinate say not only in how one will use that object but also about who if anyone shall succeed one in having that determinate say
What remains puzzling however is precisely how that moral power nifty as it may be to the rightholder arises out of the acts by which property in a given object is established 
The core contention of Act theorists is that through certain purposive and effective interactions with the extrapersonal world agents can project into the objects of those interactions the personal moral inviolability which otherwise seems to extend only to the outer surfaces of their bodies
If one is willing to acknowledge the personal inviolability expressed in the idea of selfownership one must call forth a very determined normative skepticism to doubt the basic plausibility of this core contention
The Lockean doctrine that initial rights over previously unowned segments of nature arise through the mixing of labor with that segment of nature of literal physical mixing of one stuff with another by formulating it in terms of a person s investment of his talents time and energy his human capital in the now transformed object
And once it is it is eminently plausible to maintain that the person who seizes the transformed material expropriates the human capital of the investor and thereby engages in an action on a moral par with the direct seizure involved in forced labor
He who seizes the transformed object simply cunningly waits until after the transformation occurs and thereby evades the dangers and difficulties of direct confrontation with and control of the productive party
It is essentially this Lockean argument which is recast by Nozick when he argues that
Seizing the results of someone s labor is equivalent to seizing hours from him and directing him to carry on various activities
If people force you to do certain work or unrewarded work for a certain period of time they decide what you are to do and what purposes your work is to serve apart from from you makes them a partowner of you it gives them a property right in you
Just as having such partial control and power of decision by right over an animal or inanimate object would be to have a property right in it 
The argument from liberty is likewise plausible at its core
Whereas the labor argument looks backward to the investment of self in the extrapersonal world the liberty argument looks forward to the projection of self into the world
People obviously do not live by past investments alone but also by necessarily prospective interaction with extrapersonal objects interactions which when viewed from some later point may count as an investment of self
These projections of self have particular trajectories which are at least in part defined by the extrapersonal objects put to use and through the use of which the agent projects the completion of his course
Since everyone s existence as a reasonbearing and valueseeking being has this projective dimension a right to liberty from interference with one s person with or seizure of the objects which already have been permissibly incorporated into one s ongoing courses of action
As long as use within a projected and ongoing activity is construed cautiously and narrowly as with the use that a hunter has for his bow even at the moment when it lies by his side or the use that the philosopher has for his word processor even when he is busy cooking dinner it is reasonable to say that to disrupt such use through interference or seizure of the agent s instrument is to interfere with the liberty of his person If the agent has a right to that liberty then through his permissible initiation of that ongoing use he acquires an entitlement to the extrapersonal objects therein put to use
Finally especially insofar as transfer can be pressed into the reenactment mold the considerations that Act theorists bring forward also support particular holdings acquired through voluntary transfer from their previous rightful owners
""
Internal Rights and the Limits of Act Theories taken either singly or in complementary union Part of the problem is that Act theories provide us with diverse but only scattered exemplars of entitlements to extrapersonal objects
We can identify a particular instance in which Paul has so acted as to extend the moral boundaries originally encompassing only his person to enclose this carefully crafted bow and another instance in which Sally has so acted as to extend the moral boundaries originally encompassing only her person to enclose this carefully tended field
What Act theories can provide us with are certain particularly vivid instances of property rights instances which have vivacity because these entitlements stand on their own
They need not draw their moral force from their place within any larger normative system
Each of these isolated paradigms of entitlement is selfsufficient in the sense that each contains its own justification or more precisely its justification is contained within the particular history of that holding
To see those particular historical facts in the light of selfownership is to see the wrongfulness of depriving the possessor of his holding the private holdings among those that would strike almost any ideologically untainted observer as perfectly legitimate will satisfy this standard of vivid selfsufficing justification
Most of us are fortunate enough to live in societies which at least minimally recognize the legitimacy of individuals pursuit of their own values and connectedly recognize individual rights in a considerable range of extrapersonal objects
Any such person lives in a world densely populated with legitimate entitlements
The validity of these entitlements is not conditional upon each link in their history being a selfsufficient exemplar of entitlement generation or transfer
Rather their legitimacy rests on their being the entitlements of peaceful and honest individuals to the possessions they have respectively acquired in accordance with their society s generally recognized and justifiable rules for the rightful acquisition of the types of objects in question
For such rules to be justifiable and thereby to constitute formulae for the generation of legitimate entitlements they must accommodate or better yet be analogical extensions of the selfsufficing modes of property acquisition
They must of the agent s human capital or a selfsufficing putting to use at least some conventional counterparts to such investment or putting to use
Instead or partially instead of mixing one s labor throughout the area one intends to mine or putting to use the vein of ore by bringing to the location all the equipment which extraction will ultimately require one may engage in the conventional counterpart of filing one s claim
It is these analogicalconventional extensions which make possible most of the specific legitimate entitlements which merit recognition
In considering these claims we are already entering the territory of the Practice theory
But here the point is to see the shortcomings of Act theories
Act theories themselves will not account for the host of entitlements which do not measure up to the selfsufficing exemplars they provide
And Act theories do not themselves provide justification for going beyond these exemplars to the analogicalconventional extensions which would account for those further entitlements
I have characterized Act theories as seeking to invoke an internal right in order to vindicate this strategy and hence can be viewed as a critic of Act theories of private property A brief consideration of Kant s generally enigmatic to me discussion reveals the essential validity of his critique
Kant distinguished between empirical and external possession
An object is empirically mine if and only if I am the holder of that thing that is physically connected to it An object
""
""
is externally mine if and only if it is such that any prevention of my use of it would constitute an injury to me even if it is not in my possession that is I am not the holder of the object
 Kant s argument is that a appeals to an internal right can at most support entitlements to empirical possessions b at least some entitlements are to external possessions indeed something s being externally mine is paradigmatic of entitlement hence never be adequate theories of entitlement
Thus Kant summarizes the limitations of invoking any internal rights
if I am the holder of a thing that is physically connected to it then anyone who touches it without my consent for example wrests an apple from my hand affects and diminishes that which is internally mine my freedom
Consequently the maxim of his action stands in direct contradiction to the axiom of justice rights
Thus the proposition concerning empirical possession does not extend beyond the right of the person with respect to himself 
If rights to external objects which are not continually empirically possessed are to be sustained there must be an appeal to something other than the right of the person with respect to himself
There must be an appeal to intelligible possession which for Kant is made possible by
""
""
""
the juridical postulate of practical reason It is a duty of justice to act toward also become someone s property
""
Kant may be wrong in arguing that appeals to an internal right will never get one beyond rights to what is literally held
That he is wrong about this is the thrust of my defense of Act theories
But his more general claim accords with my insistence on the limitations of Act theories
This is that in many if not most cases an agent s entitlements to an external object can not be explained by showing that the seizure of that object would diminish that which is internally his
For the seizure would not touch on what is internally his it would not trespass upon any right of the person with respect to himself
""
This limitation of internal rights of selfownership or its functional equivalents ought on reflection to be no surprise
For selfownership itself at least as ordinarily explicated does not reflect or embody the crucial and necessary role of extrapersonal objects in all persons value pursuits
To see this helpful explications of selfownership
Jeremy Waldron nicely captures this notion as follows
To say that I own myself is to say that nobody but me has the fight to dispose of me or to direct my action
I have rights to do these things though I must not harm others in doing so that is I must not exercise my selfownership in a way which violates theirs and those rights are exclusive of anyone else s privilege in this regard for they are correlative to others duties to refrain from interfering with what in this sense I own 
Selfownership is the polar opposite of moral slavery of being utterly under the moral authority of others
Thus selfownership is also aptly explicated by contrast with such slavery
As G A Cohen puts it
The thought is that each person is the morally rightful owner of himself
He possesses over himself as a matter of right all those fights that a slaveholder has over a complete chattel slave as morally speaking to dispose over himself in the way such a slaveholder is entitled legally speaking to dispose over his slave
Such a slaveholder may not direct his slave to harm other people but he is not legally obligated to place him at their disposal to the slightest degree he owes none of his slave s services to anyone else
So analogously if I am the moral owner of myself and therefore of this right arm then while others are entitled in virtue of their selfownership to prevent it from hitting people no one is entitled without my consent to press it into their own or anybody else s service 
Notice however that both Waldron s and Cohen s explications of selfownership and perhaps my own brief explication at the outset of this essay are entirely consistent with human beings requiring nothing for the feasible pursuit of their values other than materials that are internal to human beings ie to some human being or other
The parts faculties talents etc and bound not without their consent to make use of the like elements of others personal constitutions even if the use of others internal resources would advance the first selfowner s plan of life
The personal endowments of each warrant protection because they are of potential use to both their natural possessors and others
The right of each over his own person seems then to take no cognizance of the equal indispensability of extrapersonal objects in human goaldirected action This explains the incapacity of Act theories with their focus on entitlement generation solely through the exercise of some internal right to provide more than exemplars of rights to extrapersonal objects
""
The Natural Right to the Practice of Private Property
The human condition with regard to the role of extrapersonal resources in the pursuit of values is radically different from what could be inferred merely from such a right of persons over themselves
For besides being physical beings literally occupying physical space human beings extends beyond the space occupied by their respective bodies
This extended world is the field in which almost all human values are pursued and purposes are achieved
It is the field in which each of us encounters and interacts with others
And within that field human goals are advanced through the employment of individuals abilities insights and energies on the material objects of the world both the raw material and that material as it has been molded and transformed by past human purposiveness and inadvertence
Human life understood as ongoing purposive selfsustaining and selfenhancing activity takes place mostly outside of human bodies in and through the world of extrapersonal objects
Nor is the activity in which human life consists merely a matter of recurrent excursions or raids into the world of extrapersonal objects
Extrapersonal objects enter into and help define the specific goals ambitions and commitments through which individuals compose their respective lives
Particular extrapersonal objects become deeply incorporated into the specific strategies that individuals formulate for their may be merely contingently connected with the pure concept of goaloriented activity
But it is surely necessarily connected with human life and the human pursuit of ends
And emphatically this is true of all or nearly all human ends not just those that might be marked off or denigrated as economic
The lives of the religious crusader the political pamphleteer the athlete the aesthete the pornographer the family man and woman the tourist the gourmet and the gourmand all require extrapersonal vehicles and avenues
This necessary feature of human life strongly suggests that selfownership at least as so far explicated by Waldron Cohen and myself can not represent the entirety the single sturdy trunk of persons fundamental and noncontractual rights
It makes it plausible that any story that is told about the fundamental rights of individuals which does not Find significant implications in this necessary feature of human life must be an incomplete story demanding supplementation That supplementation may take the form the addition of another equally fundamental right corresponding to the practical recognition of other human beings as endsinthemselves who necessarily live their lives in and through the extrapersonal world
Since nothing is gained and clarity is lost by insisting that all fundamental natural rights must be part of selfownership I will take the strongly suggested need for supplementation to point to another equally fundamental right a companion to natural selfownership namely a natural right of property 
But must not any clearthinking advocate of classical liberalism reject anything which is strictly speaking a natural right of property For it would seem that a natural right of or at least to property must assert that each person is born to entitlements in extrapersonal objects just as he is born to a moral jurisdiction over himself
Moreover a natural right to extrapersonal products of human efforts and endeavors would clash with component of classical liberalism as well as and 
And even if such a right were restricted to and 
What then could a natural fight of property in conformity with classical liberalism be
That right could be a right to the practice of private property
The right to the practice of private property is a natural right with regard to extrapersonal objects
Nevertheless it is not itself an entitlement to any particular extrapersonal objects or any share of any such objects
Thus endorsement of this natural right is consistent with the classical liberal view that all rights to extrapersonal objects arise through the performance of entitlementconferring actions
The significance of the right to the practice of private property is that actions which are entitlementconferring at least in part enjoy this moral power in virtue of their conformity to the rules constitutive of that practice
It is this natural right to the practice of private property which I shall argue is part of the practical recognition rationally required by each person s possession of a human life with an independent rational purpose of its own
There and Practice theories of property rights on the more familiar distinction between act and ruleutilitarianism
In choosing the ActPractice terminology I have succumbed to this temptation
But it is necessary to clarify precisely how the present distinction draws upon the more commonplace one and how this temptation may lead one down misguided paths
Actutilitarianism is of course characterized by its direct application of the utilitarian conception of the good to the ranking of alternative available actions
Each action s rank depends directly on the agentneutral value of the world occasioned by its performance The available action that most promotes the agentneutral good is the highest ranked and hence the obligatory one
In contrast rule utilitarianism applies the utilitarian conception of the good to the ranking of alternative sets of rules or practices
One set of rules is ranked higher than another if and only if compliance with the former more promotes the agentneutral good than compliance with the latter
A particular action is right or even obligatory if and only A right action need not then itself have the power of more promoting the agentneutral good than all other available particular action
Indeed an action having in itself this power may nevertheless be wrong in virtue of its violation of some rule within the optimizing set of rules 
In adopting the ActPractice terminology I intend to draw upon the familiarity of the contrast between i defending a particular act or holding by displaying the particular s embodiment of the justifying quality and ii defending the particular act or holding by showing its compliance with a rule or practice which itself is the direct object of moral justification
But three divergences from the Act versus Rule utilitarian distinction must be noted
The first and relatively minor one is that Act and Practice theories of property rights aim at the vindication of assertions of rights while act and ruleutilitarianism typically seek to establish claims about the valueenhancing rightness of actions
The second and more important divergence is between the theory of entitlements in extrapersonal objects
Within the former the point is to shift the utilitarian justification from the level of acts upward to the level of rules
A central motivation for this shift is to render judgments about particular acts less directly subject to any utilitarian calculus and thereby to provide these local judgments with a greater deontic coloration
But the other side of this motivation is the desire of the ruleutilitarian to retain the fundamentally consequentialist appeal of his moral theory
In contrast the Practice theory of property rights is not at all motivated by an interest in making or reserving room at the commanding heights of the theory for consequentialist reasoning
Instead the practice in terms of which particular holdings are to be vindicated is itself supposed to be the object of persons natural moral rights the legitimacy of particular holdings is ultimately grounded upon a deontic appeal to that right and to the normatively significant features of individual life and value that underlie that right The third and perhaps most important divergence is that level of entitlementconferring rules the same justifying aim as the Act theories employ on the level of particular holdings
The Practice theory does not seek to justify some set of entitlementconferring rules by showing that this set of rules more protects or promotes the exercise of selfownership than any other set of comparable rules The Practice theory invokes a different right from that of selfproprietorship namely the natural right to the practice of private property or somewhat more precisely the natural right to others compliance with a system under which each agent can secure for himself the same sort of protected control over portions of the extrapersonal world as selfownership provides for each agent over his own person
Any such system must exhibit certain features
There must be rules specifying entitlementconferring actions
Certain forms of activity must count as establishing titles to previously unowned objects other forms of activity must count as dissolving existing titles or as acquiring titles to objects previously within the jurisdiction of others
But not every set of rules identifying entitlementconferring procedures will be coherent the specification of entitlementconferring actions must be such that noncompossible entitlements do not arise so that compliance with the resulting entitlements will always be possible
To be functional rules of the practice must be readily knowable to those governed by the practice sanctioning identifiable and predictable entitlements so that compliance with the conferred entitlements is feasible To be comprehensive the rules of the practice must sanction or be subject to reasonable analogical extension so as to sanction the acquisition of entitlements to all previously unowned objects
To be justifiable the practice must be compatible with selfownership
A justifiable system s entitlementconferring rules must in particular incorporate the plausible claims of Act theories of private property to the effect that by means of certain exercises of one s selfownership one exposes oneself to having that right violated by means of others interference with or seizure of one s external holdings and one thereby acquires entitlements to those holdings as extensions of one s selfownership
Let us say that a practice is fully comprehensive and justifiable
Still in the abstract many different practices may qualify as fully justifiable relative to any given society In the abstract the right to the practice of private property is a right to people s compliance with some one of these fully justifiable practices
Were any one of these alternative practices magically introduced at let us imagine an equally fanciful moment of mass entitlement amnesia in which all memory of who had entitlements to what under which specific rules was lost each person s right to the practice of private property would consist in his right to people s compliance with that introduced practice
Compliance with that practice would be what each could reasonably expect of others in the way of respect for his natural right of property
Having been introduced that practice would be the fully justified one
Thus even at this level justice is historical One would not be justified in substituting any other practice which was equally justifiable in the abstract for the now established and coherence or functionality of the effective system of property rights for that society if applied retroactively it would nullify entitlements conferred under an existing justifiable practice
Even an existing practice which is not in the abstract fully justifiable can be justified and thereby will be resistant to being justifiably replaced by a fully justifiable practice
It will be justified if it is roughly speaking about as abstractly justifiable as can reasonably be expected in actual human affairs
The case against substitutions of alternative practices which undercut a system s coherence and functionality does not of course rule out reform and beneficial evolution with a society s justified law of property
Such changes aiming at or at least resulting in the enhancement of the coherence functionality comprehensiveness or justifiability of the existing practice are to be guided or evaluated in terms of the organizing idea of the private property system ie the idea of sanctioning the expansion of personal spheres of authority so as to secure for individuals inviolability of a justified practice of private property individuals do acquire titles to extrapersonal objects by engaging in the specified entitlementconferring actions
Although the specification of entitlementconferring actions must embody the truths that may be gleaned from Act theories of entitlement some entitlementconferring acts under a given justified practice will not involve the sort of extension of selfownership which is the focus of Act theories
Those acts nevertheless confer entitlements in virtue of their conformity to the entitlementgenerating rules of a justified practice
In addition although I am not sure what weight to give this factor the expectations with regard to protected holdings that are generated under an existing justified system are legitimate expectations
As legitimate expectations they provide individuals with reasonable claims against those who are bound to comply with that practice
When that compliance occurs the entitlements generated by the actions specified by a practice s rules and corresponding to the agents legitimate expectations and sometimes further supported by Act theory considerations are respected 
The particular constraints with which individuals have in fact come into operation in the society and which actual entitlementconferring actions individuals have in fact performed
Justice in extrapersonal holdings is as Nozick maintained in Anarchy State and Utopia historical and unpatterned
The justice of any particular holding is a matter of that holding actually arising through certain specific procedures namely those that confer entitlement within the existing justified practice
A set of holdings among people ie a distribution of holdings is just insofar as the particular holdings are independently historically legitimate
The justice of the whole follows from the justice of the parts not the other way around
Thus no characteristic of the whole can be the touchstone of the justice of the whole or of its constituent parts
The justice of the whole distribution will depend neither on its presentation of a certain profile eg equality among holdings or the maximization of the smallest packet of holdings nor on the individual holdings within that distribution mapping some other characteristic of the property holders absence of any preordained pattern to which the distribution of extrapersonal material must conform parallels the absence of any such regulative pattern for the distribution of personal endowments as was anticipted in the first paragraphs of section II
Each individual s status as a moral endinhimself with a life of his own to lead I have maintained requires that his person not be subjected to assault invasion or seizure
This status requires that he not be treated as a means morally available for the purposes of others
This is to say that the elements of each person s constitution his body faculties talents and energies must be acknowledged as uniquely his means for the pursuit of his valued ends acknowledged as within his distinct moral domain
Each individual s status as a moral endinhimself with a human life to lead in and through the world of extrapersonal objects requires that others rational recognition of them must extend into that external world
That recognition translates for worldinteractive
human beings into
Since people live their lives in and through the external world necessarily deeply incorporating into their plans particular external objects and contouring their lives through attachments to them any recognition of them as moral endsinthemselves who are owed immmunity in their peaceful ie immunityrespecting pursuit of values must recognize and respect their incorporations and attachments
The status of persons as endsinthemselves requires then that the use acquisition stocking transformation incorporation and deployment of those extrapersonal objects in and through which human individuals create and advance their lives not be subject to assault invasion or disruption
It demands that these modes of use and interaction with extrapersonal objects modes of interaction and use in which individuals enjoy exclusive discretionary and stable albeit alienble control possess a moral immunity in the form of moral constraints on the actions of others comparable to the constraints against attacks upon the person himself
The very projects through which human beings constitute themselves as persons and achieve value in their lives necessarily involve instances but over lifetimes
Thus there is an Hegelian dimension to the case for a natural right of property a dimension which emphasizes that human life is not lived within our bodies but rather is enacted through purposive interaction with the world In a world of finite extrapersonal resources it is only under the auspices of such a system of immunities that persons can be free of assault upon their worldengaging and selfdefining projects and thus upon the very core of their separate lives
Respect for the entitlements conferred by a justified practice of private property is respect for separate project pursuers as beings whose lives are necessarily engaged in and contoured to and by the extrapersonal world

Introduction
In his book Morals by Agreement David Gauthier offers a stateofnature justification for a form of ownership which he believes closely resembles private ownership Gauthier argues that first appropriation of land within certain restrictions morally justifies vesting in the appropriator rights resembling private ownership
Gauthier is not alone in his use of a stateofnature justification of a form of ownership
Locke Rousseau Kant and recently Robert Nozick have also offered stateofnature justifications
I have already shown how these other attempts at justification fail but because Gauthier s attempt is far more subtle and complex his arguments require me to do more than simply refer to what I have earlier said
I have argued that all stateofnature justifications by first appropriation must fail because they presuppose unrealistic conditions and are questionbegging
I shall prove that Gauthier s stateofnature justification is no exception
I shall limit this discussion of Gauthier s justification to his treatment of ownership of land and resources
Gauthier s arguments concerning do not depend upon a stateofnature appropriation and many of his conclusions about ownership of self and labor run parallel to conclusions I have reached
It is primarily Gauthier s reliance upon a stateofnature firstappropriation justification of ownership which causes his arguments to fail
The failure is methodological it does not depend upon substantive morality
His faulty methodology can not give determinate conclusive results
In the next section I shall show that Gauthier s justification is questionbegging because he fails to establish that private ownership and only private ownership is derivable from stateofnature conditions
I shall demonstrate in the third section that Gauthier s justification of the form he believes resembles private ownership appears plausible only because it presupposes unrealistic abundance in the state of nature which thus makes unnecessary any form of ownership at all In the final section I shall contrast Gauthier s form of ownership with private ownership and show that the ways in which Gauthier s form of ownership differs from private ownership make his form of ownership impossible to put into practice
Any moral justification of a form of ownership grounded upon an original act of appropriation in a state of nature must show not only that the particular form is thus grounded but also that no other form can be so grounded
Using private ownership as an example it is not sufficient to show that private ownership can be grounded on original appropriation in a state of nature the argument must also show that no other form of ownership such as communal ownership can also fulfill the relevant standard of justification
Let me explain more fully what I mean because this point is almost universally ignored
Suppose that a Gauthier or a Locke tries to prove that private ownership based upon original private appropriation produces more utility or benefit to each individual than the state of nature in which land and resources in effect constitute a commons available to all
While this argument may seem to justify private ownership the argument does not show that only private ownership is morally justified
There may be other forms of ownership also produce more utility or benefit than a state of nature in which land and resources are a commons available to all
If the standard of justification is the production of greater benefit or utility for each than the stateofnature commons then private ownership private usufruct and collective cooperative ownership may be morally justified
The problem is that this stateofnature justification shows all three to be justified which means that this stateofnature argument can not be used to decide which of the three is morally preferable
A complete justification would have to show that private ownership and only private ownership fulfills the standard of justification
Other forms of ownership must therefore be examined and shown not to fulfill the standards
Arguments which show that private ownership or any other form is grounded upon original appropriation but which fail to show that only private ownership or some other form is so grounded I shall call partial justifications
This distinction between partial and complete justifications is different from and independent of the distinction between what is justification of ownership might conclude that one specific form and only one specific form of ownership is morally justified and thus morally required
By contrast moral justification of ownership might conclude that several closely related forms of ownership are all morally permissible and that no one of them is morally required
Adopting any one of the closely related forms would be right
To be closely related in this sense implies that these forms of ownership are constituted by certain rights of title such as the right to income or the right to manage or certain criteria of title such as bequest which are morally optional This is to say that either vesting the right or withholding the right must be morally permissible
Forms of ownership would not be closely related in this sense if vesting the right were morally permissible and withholding it were not
Just as a justification of a morally required form of ownership can be either complete or partial so also can a justification of morally permissible forms of ownership be either complete or of closely related forms of ownership is justifiable so that any form within the range is morally permissible
A complete justification of ownership would have to argue that these closely related forms and only these closely related forms fulfill the justificatory requirements
If the argument demonstrates that the closely related forms fulfill the justificatory requirements without also demonstrating that other unrelated forms fail to fulfill the requirements then the justification is only partial
Any argument which grounds a specific form of ownership upon some justificatory requirement without explaining why other forms can not be similarly grounded fails to provide a complete justification and may also fail to provide reasons for judging whether the form of ownership is morally permissible or morally required
Gauthier as well as Locke Kant and Nozick offers only a partial justification of private ownership
Not only does Gauthier never consider the possibility that other forms of ownership might have the same results as private ownership but indeed there are other forms of ownership which do have the same result
That is integral to his method as he sees it
Gauthier considers morality to be the product of agreement for cooperative interaction which is required to remedy the essential imperfections of the free market Both the free market as a morally free zone and cooperative agreements to internalize external costs presuppose an impartial but not equal initial bargaining position of factor endowments This is to say that markets presuppose people own something to exchange in the market and that bargaining presupposes that people start at some position of strength or weakness from which they may assess the value of various possible agreements
Gauthier argues that in order for the outputs from the free market and from agreements to be moralized the inputs ie the initial position must be proven to be impartial
Gauthier rejects an equal initial position such as John Rawls s because it permits free riders Original impartial private appropriation is the necessary moral foundation which Gauthier believes he needs in order to moralize the outputs of the reasons integral to Gauthier s theory it must be noticed that in general gift bequest and exchange are incomplete as criteria of title
Each presupposes some additional criterion of title which would originally distribute legitimate title over things so that individuals could then transfer title by gift bequest or exchange
Social contract theorists have solved the problem of original distribution in two different ways
Some have made the distribution prior to the contract while others have made the distribution part of the contract
Rawls and Hobbes make the distribution a result of the social contract
In the Leviathan Hobbes s contract empowers the sovereign to make original distribution as well as to make the rules governing subsequent transfers Rawls makes the communal ownership of talents and abilities part of the contract
By contrast Hume and Locke locate the original distribution in what exist prior to the convention or contract
For Hume present possession at the time of the convention is the natural expedient for making the original labor on what is unowned as the criterion for his initial distribution
Gauthier like Hume and Locke adopts the precontract rather than the contractdependent methodology
Gauthier s justification of private ownership rests upon the following illustration
Imagine that several persons inhabit an island where the land and resources in effect constitute a commons available to all
Use is in dividual each family provides primarily for its own needs and interaction is noncooperative
Suppose that Eve the head of one of the families is aware that planned intensive cultivation would make the land more productive so that she proposes to take a certain area of the island for her exclusive use in order that her family may benefit by maximizing its productivity
She seeks therefore an exclusive right to a certain portion of the island
Eve seeks the security of tenure which market compensation rather than full compensation confers
Full compensation according to Gauthier is compensation which leaves a person without any net loss in utility
might realize through exchange
Eve seeks the more comprehensive protection which a right in the product of her labor would realize Eve intends to better her family s situation through a system of rights that determine her endowment for prospective market and cooperative interaction
Gauthier argues that Eve s appropriation need not be brought about by worsening the situation of the other islanders
While Eve might seek to appropriate a toolarge portion of the island which would violate the Lockean proviso against worsening the situation of others there might be sufficiently abundant land such that she need not worsen the situation of others
Eve s appropriation might be small enough and her increased productivity might be sufficiently large so that her fellow islanders might be better off through exchanges with her than they were before she privately appropriated her plot of land
Gauthier concludes his derivation by showing that if Eve gives up her rights to the remaining commons and if Eve s increased productivity would be beneficial to her as well as to others then her exclusive rights of possession are in Gauthier s words the great benefactress of human kind
""
I shall not at this point contest Gauthier s conclusion that Eve s appropriation can be beneficial both to herself and the other islanders
In this section I shall assume that Gauthier is right about Eve s appropriation being beneficial
My problem with Gauthier s method is that he gives only a partial justification of possible forms of appropriation in the state of nature
Gauthier never considers other forms of ownership in addition to private ownership that might be beneficial in much the same way as private ownership
The benefits of Eve s private appropriation arise because intensive agriculture may produce greater quantities of food per acre than unimproved land
Vesting in Eve the right to use the land and the right to what she produces is necessary in order for Eve rationally to undertake the labor of farming
As Hobbes wisely maintained long ago agriculture as well as industry is not rational unless one can count upon the rightful possession of what if agriculture or industry is to be rationally undertaken
While it is certainly true that private ownership vests in appropriators the rights rationally needed for such an undertaking it is just as certainly true that other possible forms of ownership vest in appropriators rights which satisfy the same rational necessity
Gauthier s justification is only a partial justification because he does not consider forms other than private ownership
Suppose instead of Eve s private appropriation that a group of persons Karl Friedrich and Rosa agree to collectively appropriate land for the purpose of intensive cultivation They agree to share evenly both the work of farming and the product produced
With their increased productivity Karl Friedrich and Rosa could exchange their products with the other islanders as does Eve
This form of collective ownership has the same economic consequences in the state of nature as does Eve s private appropriation
Thus if Eve s appropriation is morally justifiable then so is the collective appropriation by Karl Friedrich and s terms sufficiently compensate any losers 
Such collective ownership in itself might be a morally compatible alternative to Eve s private appropriation which could be practiced along with private ownership without any moral incoherence
But collective ownership could further evolve by stages consistent with Gauthier s justification into a form of ownership which is morally very different from private ownership
This collective ownership by Karl Friedrich and Rosa could evolve within the confines established by Gauthier into an islandwide social ownership
Imagine that the other islanders see the success achieved by Karl Friedrich and Rosa so that they too desire to join the collective
So instead of exchanging what they produce with the collective the other islanders judge themselves better off by joining the collective as coworkers
Since the land collectively farmed could be expanded or the number of products could be multiplied Karl Friedrich and Rosa could judge themselves better off as well
All islanders might see the advantages of social ownership and management of the island
They could agree to social selfmanagement and ownership of the land and resources on the island 
Neither the collective ownership by Karl Friedrich and Rosa nor the social ownership by all the islanders need be equivalent to private ownership in its variant forms of joint or corporate ownership
Such private ownership rights as bequest exchange or alienation need not be included in the rights which vest in the members of the collective
The form of ownership may not permit any right to alienate the land that is identified with the people who live on it
Such is the case Marx cites of primitive forms of communism as well as with the concept of ownership held by Native American tribes
That Karl Rosa and Friedrich agree to cooperate does not violate Gauthier s assumptions about human motivation
Gauthier defends a subjective theory of value
A person s considered preferences determine her reasons for choice and action
Even though Gauthier s basic motivational assumption is the subjective theory of value he sometimes describes his or nontuistic
Several commentators have noted that Gauthier s descriptions are not equivalent A subjective theory of value does not logically limit a person s motivation only to choices that are selfinterested or nontuistic
Someone may prefer to advance the interests of others eg the interests of friends and lovedones
Selfinterest and nontuism of course limit the content of preferences
Gauthier has recently said that his selfinterest assumption is to prevent doublecounting in utility calculations such a practice would count some preferences twice and thus upset Pareto optimality Gauthier s reply does not explain why the decision by Karl Rosa and Friedrich to cooperate need violate his assumption whether it is described as the subjective theory of value or as selfinterested
If Karl Rosa and Friedrich prefer to cooperate then there is no incompatibility with a subjective theory of value
Karl s Rosa s and Friedrich s choice to cooperate also need not violate either the assumption of selfinterest or of nontuism
Cooperation can from cooperation
Gauthier s argument in Morals by Agreement depends upon this
Gauthier s decision to base the initial position upon a private appropriation is therefore one plausible choice but it is not the only logical or best one
Private ownership and exchange is one way individuals may benefit but it is not the only way
Working together and sharing the increased productivity is another
Cooperation is not incompatible with assumptions about selfinterest or nontuism
Nor can Gauthier argue that cooperation between Karl Friedrich and Rosa is excluded because it would be a contract before the social contract
First of all as I remarked earlier social contract theorists have dealt with the problem of initial distribution by both precontract and contractdependent methodologies
Nothing in the idea of a social contract necessitates a precontract methodology rather than a contractdependent one
Second Gauthier s own method must permit precontract agreements and cooperation both of which are presupposed by the free market which Gauthier believes exists prior to and is the reason for morals by why Gauthier s justification of private ownership is only a partial justification
He simply fails to discuss other forms of ownership which could plausibly fit his justificatory schema
My example of collective ownership and social ownership could equally arise in Gauthier s stateofnature circumstances
Gauthier does not consider this possibility
I do not believe Gauthier sees his Eve illustration as demonstrating that private ownership is only morally permissible and not morally required
Gauthier says nothing that would even hint at this option
Besides even if Gauthier s intention were to prove only that private ownership is morally permissible his justification would still be partial because he has not demonstrated that some forms and only some forms of ownership are morally permissible
Gauthier s attempt at justifying private ownership from an original appropriation in the state of nature fails to produce a complete justification of private ownership which shows that private ownership and only private ownership is morally justifiable
His justification is partial because his arguments fail to exclude other possible forms of ownership
Gauthier is not unique in has carefully compared the implications of different forms of ownership in state of nature conditions
It is not a sufficient proof to establish merely that private ownership is an improvement upon the state of nature
A complete justification must actually show that no other possible form of ownership can do as well
""
Ownership and Scarcity
In this section I shall focus upon the issue of scarcity in the state of nature
Specifically and contrary to Gauthier s expressed arguments I shall show that Eve s private appropriation can only fulfill the conditions of the proviso against worsening the condition of others in extremely unrealistic conditions I shall show that the conditions in which Eve s appropriation is unlikely to violate the proviso are exceptional rather than conditions which are generally fulfilled
Thus Gauthier s justification may be successful only in exceptional circumstances
Moreover in such exceptional circumstances any form of ownership would be unnecessary
Gauthier seems to be aware of the problem of defining scarcity realistically since he correctly admits that not be fulfilled in any actual circumstances Locke s criterion that an act of appropriation must leave enough and as good for others to appropriate could only be fulfilled if objects of appropriation were to exist in such superabundance that no act of appropriation diminishes the amount others may still appropriate
One of Locke s own examples aptly illuminates this point
Locke asks who could complain were someone to take a large draught of water from a great river if enough water remains for everyone else to do the same Gauthier realizes that neither land nor resources actually exist in such superabundance
But Gauthier does not seem to realize that were Locke s criterion fulfilled no form of ownership whatsoever would be necessary
Hume is well aware of this when he argues that scarcity is a necessary prerequisite of having any form of ownership
It is only because goods of the world are scarce that ownership rules are necessary Were goods as superabundant as the water in Locke s river there would be no need to objection to Gauthier s use of a state of nature justification differs from an objection raised by David Braybrooke
Braybrooke argues that Gauthier s contract unlike Locke s can not be applied in history because of its fantastic demands on information which no contracting parties could meet Braybrooke focuses upon the empirical impossibility of ever fulfilling the conditions of the contract
My point is different in that it rests on a conceptual not an empirical difficulty
I shall not be concerned about whether Gauthier s stateofnature conditions ever historically existed
My objection is that if Gauthier s stateofnature conditions could be fulfilled there would be no reason to have any form of ownership whatsoever
The historical question about whether or not the conditions of Gauthier s state of nature ever could be fulfilled is not crucial
Gauthier s premise that Eve s appropriation not worsen the condition of others seems to acknowledge that land does not exist in superabundance
The implication seems to be that Eve s appropriation could make others worse off so that in a fixed limited supply
Gauthier s assumption of scarcity appears realistic enough to avoid the unrealistic abundance which Hume believes makes ownership unnecessary
But once Gauthier s assumption is examined more closely it is not at all obvious that Eve s appropriation will not violate the proviso unless land exists in an unrealistically abundant quantity
Gauthier argues that even though Eve s appropriation of land may worsen the condition of the other islanders because they lose the use of Eve s land Eve s increased productivity will actually enable her to improve the condition of the others
Gauthier s argument is similar to the KaldorHicks improvement condition where one state of affairs is judged better than another if the winners are able to but need not actually compensate the losers Gauthier believes that Eve s greater efficiency and productivity will enable her to compensate the losers so that no one is made worse off but Gauthier does not present any specific arguments to support his belief
Such arguments would have to demonstrate that Eve can be sufficiently productive is therefore necessary to estimate Eve s productivity and the other islander s losses
What are the benefits Eve and her family receive Gauthier claims she intends to benefit herself and her family by a more efficient and productive cultivation of her land
Gauthier further assumes that those benefits Eve seeks must derive from an increased quantity of food which will be exchanged with the other islanders
Eve might however have chosen to benefit herself and her family by using her increased efficiency in production to create greater leisure for her and her family
There is nothing in Gauthier s subjective theory of value to preclude Eve from judging her leisure as a benefit
Obviously for Gauthier leisure is not the kind of benefit Eve must produce in order for her appropriation to be justifiable because it would not enable her to compensate the others
The gains that Eve must intend to produce for herself and her family must be benefits that are divisible exchangeable and valued by the other islanders
Eve must therefore intend better housing or clothing for her family
In any case the quantity of exchanageable material goods which Eve must produce in order to justify her appropriation will depend upon the losses of the other islanders
The other islanders lose their use of Eve s land the right to manage it the income from it the fight to trespass hunt gather and so on which before Eve s appropriation they had in common
These can be significant losses
If the quantity of land on the island is large compared to the population this reduces the value of the loss of land due to Eve s appropriation
But by the same reasoning if the population is large compared to quantity of land the loss will be substantial
Suppose for the sake of argument that the only benefit or loss relevant to Eve s appropriation is the food supply
This is a much too narrow assumption in light of the variety of rights which the islanders lose to Eve but Gauthier s derivation depends upon unrealistic assumptions about the land
Granted this assumption the increase in Eve s food production must be greater than the loss of naturally available food the islanders could appropriate before Eve s appropriation
Gauthier asserts without argument that Eve can produce more food by agriculture than was available before her appropriation
Intensive agriculture may not however always be more abundantly productive
A great deal depends upon the level of technology the fertility of the soil the amount of rainfall the length of the growing season and so forth
It is possible to imagine many counterinstances in which our ecosystem might not be made more productive through intensive agriculture
Land in some arid climates might produce grasses suitable for grazing wild animals but be much too dry for raising vegetables and fruits
In some tropical rain forests topsoil would be washed away if the forests were cleared for intensive agriculture
In such cases Eve s private appropriation would not be justifiable because she could not satisfy produce sufficient surplus food
These counterinstances may not be an objection to Gauthier s argument if he is trying to show that private appropriation is justifiable only under some special conditions
Gauthier may not be arguing that private appropriation is always rationally justifiable because he does not believe either that the free market or morals by agreement are always rational
But if this were Gauthier s intention he would have to show that the two failures are extensionally equivalent ie he would have to argue that private appropriation fails where and only where both the free market and morals by agreement are also irrational
Gauthier would have to show that there are no possible examples such as a simple pastoral society in which both the free market and morals by agreement are rational yet the land lacks sufficient fertility for intensive agriculture to produce additional food
Gauthier to my knowledge never addresses this point
Still to give Gauthier s argument a sympathetic reading attention may be focused upon the conditions in which and her family
This surplus must be sufficiently large to compensate all those who lose by Eve s appropriation
But to render this argument germane to the actual circumstances Eve must confront it is necessary to drop the assumption that food is the only good which is gained or lost by Eve and the other islanders
Gauthier must therefore prove that Eve s surplus is greater than the losses of others
Even with this expanded assumption only some of Eve s gains are relevant to calculating her ability to compensate the losers
As previously noted Eve could not choose to benefit herself with greater leisure because these benefits are not divisible and exchangeable with others
Nor could Eve use her spare time to manufacture widgets unless widgets were valued by the other islanders
Eve s gains are thus in principle easy to measure ie Eve s gains are a specific quantity of foodstuffs and perhaps raw materials for clothing and shelter which she can offer in exchange
The losses incurred by The other islanders lose the right to hunt and gather on Eve s land
They lose the right to trespass upon her land
And they lose the right to any of the natural resources such as water which may exist upon her land
The size and value of their losses can not be calculated in any general or abstract way
Any gains and losses of each act of private appropriation have to be calculated in each particular case
Suppose for example that the land Eve selects for intensitive cultivation is unremarkable except for its location in a flat valley between two mountains and Eve s cultivation prevents others using the valley for passage between the mountains
The value of the lost right to trespass could conceivably be greater than the value of the surplus Eve produces especially if many lose the right to traverse her land
Eve s appropriation of the flat land might also reduce land space for the others to build living quarters
Eve s land may be a breeding ground for rabbits which are easily multiplied
Gauthier must assume in order for this argument to be plausible in general that amply productive land is the rule not the exception
If his argument is to justify private appropriation of land as an impartial original bargaining position he must assume that good fertile land is not so scarce that counterinstances arise only in rare or exceptional circumstances
Not only does Gauthier fail to supply arguments to support his assumption that land is sufficiently abundant he also supplies no arguments to show that Eve s primitive attempts at intensive agriculture can actually produce the required surplus
Gauthier must provide such arguments if his justification of private appropriation is to have any general plausibility
Otherwise Gauthier s arguments at best show that private appropriation is justified only in a few special circumstances
I do not think there are general arguments showing that land exists in the abundance which Gauthier s justification requires
Even if it is possible to show that unowned land did at some earlier time exist in such a would be successful
First it is questionable what relevance such abundance would now have for the issue of justifying ownership of scarce land and resources
Braybrooke s argument about the lack of historical applicability is relevant here
It does not seem to be rational to agree to govern our behavior in general and under all conditions by moral rules which presuppose circumstances that are rarely encountered in our experience
Second and more important the abundance of land required to make Gauthier s arguments plausible is likely to make the need for ownership moot
In order to minimize the losses which need to be compensated unowned land would have to be so plentiful that it is difficult to see the need for any form of ownership at all
No one would have a reason to try to interfere with Eve under conditions of abundance because the costs of interference would likely be higher than the costs of appropriating without interfering with Eve
The other islanders would not logically have to acknowledge that Eve has rights over what she in these special circumstances they should not interfere with Eve s appropriation because noninterference is most costeffective
As Kraus and Coleman point out the motive for rational individuals in the state of nature to cooperate is the existence of costs But if Eve s appropriation requires so much abundance that there is practically no cost to others there is no need for any rights of ownership Eve can simply be ignored
As Hume argues and as Locke s river illustrates in abundance there is no need for ownership
Gauthier s arguments thus seem plausible because he presupposes unrealistic conditions of abundance which render any form of land ownership unnecessary

Ownership as Theft
I borrow this title from Proudhon not primarily because I believe that private ownership of land and resources is theft although I do believe it but because it points to a major difficulty in the form of ownership which Gauthier attempts to justify In the previous sections I have ignored the differences between Gauthier s form of ownership argument with Gauthier
I shall now show that Gauthier s form of ownership warrants taking what someone owns without his permission hence the idea that Gauthier s form of ownership resembles theft
The concept of private ownership must first be clarified in order to contrast it with Gauthier s form
I shall rely upon AM Honore s work and define private ownership as being constituted by the right to possess the right to use the right to manage the right to income the right to the capital the right to security the right of transmissibility and absence of term Honore s concept is consistent with that of John Locke who says for truly I have no property in that which another can by right take from me against my consent
 Let me call this Locke s nontheft condition
This condition implies that the rights which vest in private owners may not be taken away against the owner s consent
While Gauthier sometimes appears to recognize Locke s nontheft of private ownership in other crucial places His form of ownership actually warrants taking what another owns without his consent
Not only does Gauthier violate Locke s nontheft condition but his form of ownership may not be capable of actually being practiced because of this violation
Gauthier is well aware that his form of ownership differs from private ownership
Eve the orignal appropriator does not gain all of the rights enumerated on Honore s list
Eve does not first of all get the right to all uses of her land nor secondly does she get the right to all possible incomes
If Eve appropriates her plot of land with the intention of farming Gauthier argues that her rights of use over the land do not extend to any oil or other valuable minerals which might subsequently be discovered on the land
Gauthier s reasons are that owning the oil or minerals was not part of Eve s original intention in appropriating the land and also that such an appropriation might make Eve unclear why Gauthier believes Eve s original intentions are relevant to the right of use she acquires over what she appropriates although he does follow Kant here especially since intention is opaque or occurs under a particular description While Eve might appropriate the land with the intention of farming it might also be correct to describe her intention as a desire to use the land in any way that will maximize her family s utility
Would Gauthier have to concede that under this second description Eve should receive the rights to use any oil or other valuable minerals There are additional problems
Suppose as in Gauthier s original example Eve does not obtain rights over the subsurface mineral resources
If at some later time Rosa wishes to purchase Eve s land in order to develop the mineral resources and assuming Rosa would not be a monopolist Rosa could not acquire the mineral rights with Eve s land because Eve does not have those rights to sell
Who has those rights Gauthier of the island collectively could exercise the rights to subsurface minerals assuming that anyone has those rights
To vest rights over what one owns according to the intention at initial appropriation would create significant indeterminacy in actually practicing Gauthier s form of ownership
It would be difficult to prove where there is controversy what the initial appropriator s intentions were at the time she first appropriated
After her death it may be impossible to ever establish beyond doubt what her intentions were
Ultimately it may become impossible to know what rights owners may exercise over particular parcels of land especially since these rights will vary from parcel to parcel because of the variety of initial intentions
Limiting the use and management rights of owners by their original intention makes Gauthier s form of ownership different from and much more restricted than private ownership where owners are not limited by their original intention
Private ownership vests in owner s an unlimited right to use and manage what they own as they choose as long as they behave within an appropriator develops unowned land with an original intention of growing food but subsequently decides to use the land for a jogging track
Private ownership which vests in owners the right to use the land as they please would permit this kind of change of use
Private ownership would even permit the owner to let the land lie unused in any way
Gauthier s form of ownership as he defends it would not permit an owner to change the use in this way
Gauthier would have to argue that because a jogging track was not part of the original intention provided the intention could be determined and because the jogging track might not produce as much utility for everyone as does the growing of food the owner might not have any right to alter the use to which the land is put
The second difference between private ownership and Gauthier s form illustrates how Gauthier violates Locke s nontheft condition
This difference concerns the right to the income from what one owns
Gauthier believes rent produced by what they own
Gauthier uses the example of the income Wayne Gretzky may rightfully earn from the use of his self and his labor Private ownership would vest in Gretzky the right to any income he could obtain without force or fraud in a free market
Gauthier argues that Gretzky does not have this right
Gretzky has no right to an income which exceeds the minimum needed to induce him to play hockey his marginal productivity because economic efficiency would not be achieved were he paid a premium or factor rent for his relatively scarce skills
This difference between the two sets of ownership rights is justified according to Gauthier because his form promotes economic efficiency and utility maximization in circumstances where a private ownership freemarket form does not
Gauthier generalizes from the Gretzky example when he says In the state of nature if not always in society efficient use is a condition of rightful possession
Although rights are temporally openended they are subject to alteration in light of changed the rights which vest in owners and may change the person in whom the fights vest
Owners may lose rights over what they own or even lose the things they own if economic efficiency and utility could thereby be promoted
The owner s consent is not a requirement according to Gauthier for owners to lose what they own
Thus Locke s nontheft condition is clearly violated
Locke s idea of private ownership and Honore s as well do not restrict private owners to only economically efficient and utilitymaximizing uses of what they own
There is an unresolvable problem which Gauthier fails to notice when he says that in the state of nature efficient use is a condition of rightful possession
Efficient use can only be measured after markets are established
Markets however presuppose not only that people already own something to exchange but also that the rights over what they own are defined and determinate
Economic value depends upon the rights which can be acquired
Gauthier can not employ efficient use as makes sense if the criterion for vesting rights is already presupposed
Not only does Gauthier s form of ownership violate Locke s nontheft condition his form of ownership also violates what I call Hume s dictum
Hume s dictum is that possession must be stable no matter what else ownership rules happen to do Not only must people be able to know what they own and what their rights are but they must be able to know under what conditions they may lose rights over what they own and importantly be able to more or less control the conditions under which they lose their rights to what they own
Gauthier s example of Eve s appropriation relies upon the wisdom contained in Hume s dictum
Eve must be able to rely upon a fairly uninterrupted possession of her land in order for her improvement of the land to be rational
She must be able to count upon recouping her costs
If Eve expects to enjoy the benefits of her labor she must be without any interference from others
Others must not have the right to take what she improves and produces
This is why Gauthier is correct in arguing that some form of ownership is a necessary prerequisite for Eve rationally to undertake her economically beneficial farming
Ignoring for the moment the circularity in attempting to define rightful possession in the state of nature by the criterion of efficient use Gauthier does not seem to appreciate that his own condition of efficient use may undermine the stability of possession
Suppose that the very real problems of deciding who is to judge who is an efficient user and who is to judge efficient use for which purposes can somehow be resolved there is still the difficulty that deciding ownership upon efficient use may render possession too unstable to be efficiently developed or used
In the Treatise Hume discusses just this point He considers an actutilitarian criterion of title which would vest the rights of ownership in persons who could make the best use of what is owned
The problem Hume sees with this criterion uncertain
 A person who might make the best use of something today might not be the person who could make the best use of it tomorrow
This uncertainty may deter owners from making investments in what they own because others might be able to make more economically efficient use of it
Eve for example might be deterred from improving her land for farming if she feared that Rosa might find a still more efficient use and rightfully claim the land
Allocating ownables by a criterion of best or efficient use may paradoxically imply less good or efficient uses because people may refrain from risky investments and improvements
Efficient use is selfdefeating where it violates Hume s dictum
Ownership is less secure in Gauthier s form of ownership than in private ownership
Gauthier might try to respond to this criticism by claiming that in actual practice ownership will not be so uncertain as to undermine economically desirable improvement and investment
His argument will have to be grounded upon premises concerning risk propensity and aversion ongoing debate over whether a propensity or aversion to risk is subject to rational assessment or whether it is merely a psychological disposition
Even if it could be established that there are rational conditions for risk Gauthier would still need to argue that his efficient use criterion would leave ownership sufficiently certain and stable for risks to be rational
But were such arguments possible they could not be absolute or general
Gauthier would have to examine actual conditions in order to estimate the effects of his criterion of ownership on certainty and stability of possession in relation to rational risk
I have ignored Gauthier s point that compensation may be paid to the less efficient user if what is owned is appropriated by a more efficient user Requiring compensation will reduce risk uncertainty and instability
I ignored compensation to isolate the problem in violating Hume s dictum
Compensation as Gauthier is aware does lessen the problem
But lessening the problem in this case may or may not remove it
If compensation is person whose rights are appropriated can establish the value to her of what is taken away then ownership may not be sufficiently uncertain to violate Hume s dictum
But a subjective evaluation of the level of compensation does not guarantee economic efficiency in fact it may obstruct economic efficiency eg in cases where homeowners refuse even outrageously large offers from real estate developers
The idea of market value compensation might be thought to be more appropriate
Market value compensation is problematic as I noted earlier discussing Gretzky and efficient use because market value as well as efficiency presuppose determinate criteria for rightful possession
Even so in situations where market value is less than subjective value the problem of uncertainty would not be solved
For high risks or for very costly improvements Gauthier s efficient use criterion even with the payment of compensation may have the effect of reducing economic efficiency rather than promoting it
I therefore do not believe Gauthier has avoided the difficulties Hume sees in violating his dictum
 form of ownership which closely resembles private ownership by an argument from original appropriation in the state of nature fails in the ways all such arguments fail
They fail because of the unrealistic conditions which must be presupposed and because of the partial questionbegging arguments which are employed
I have shown that even Gauthier s ingenious arguments fail to overcome the problems inherent in all stateofnature derivations
Thus my contention that all stateofnature derivations fail still holds without exception
Philosophers must avoid trying to justify ownership by this unrealistic and therefore irrelevant method
Gauthier s justification of a form of ownership also has problems which are independent of his method of argument
Unlike private ownership Gauthier s form of ownership justifies sometimes rightfully taking what a person owns without that person s consent
This violation of Locke s nontheft condition may also lead to a violation of Hume s dictum
I have discussed these violations more fully in my book under the heading of the necessary logical structure of ownership
The failure of form of ownership demonstrates that philosophers
As philosophers continue to try to find moral justification for a form of ownership they must first show that the form they are trying to justify fulfills the necessary logical requirements of ownership
Instead of relying upon state of nature arguments philosophers need to follow a methodology I have called a schema of justification A schema of justification illustrates the application of concepts to actual empirical conditions
A moral justification of a form of ownership would have to fulfill three tasks
First the form of ownership would have to be shown to meet the necessary logical structure of all forms of ownership Second the form of ownership would have to either be derived from some rationally grounded moral principles or if rational grounding is judged impossible be shown to be consistent with our fundamental moral intuitions
And third the actual societal conditions in which the form of ownership is to be applied must be examined to determine what the rationally grounded moral principle or our fundamental moral intuitions require in each specific circumstance
always be able to demonstrate how to rectify injustices which occur in any actual circumstance but no methodology that I know of seems to be capable of accomplishing such a task
A schema of justification nevertheless avoids the oversimplifications and abstractions inherent in stateofnature arguments
A schema of justification guarantees moral relevance
And because a schema of justification requires that forms of ownership be tested against the necessary logical structure of all forms of ownership there is a guarantee that it is at least possible to put the form of ownership into actual practice
James O Grunebaum

Over the last decade and a half a group of philosophers has argued that justice is equivalent to or at least involves the historically based entitlement of a person to certain objects The principles which identify the sources of those entitlements define a set of rights held by all human beings according to these authors
When this historical entitlement theory is conjoined to a theory of selfownership it constitutes the libertarian theory of justice a theory which identifies justice with the rightful entitlement of persons to themselves and to certain objects that they acquire by specified means and to the freedom to use both as they choose
As such it is more than merely a theory of distributive justice for it delineates what it takes to be an exhaustive list of rights some of which are distributive or economic rights but one of which is a right of selfownership which implies a right of selfgovernance or personal liberty
Moreover this exhaustive list specifies according to the libertarian both the purpose of governmental this list as well as its legitimate boundaries ie the obligation to protect only those rights and the duty to refrain from violations of them
While various aspects of this libertarian conception of justice have been laboriously investigated little attention has been devoted to its implications for the theory of civil and criminal remediation This essay is an attempt to rectify that omission
In it I will argue that the libertarian theory in particular as explicated by Nozick has certain implications for the theory of remediation that are startling and opposed to his own views about the appropriate public response to wrongdoing
Specifically I will argue first that the libertarian thesis both entails a restitutionist and compensatory theory of remediation and excludes punitive remedial principles Accordingly I will also maintain that the conception of TOOLONG arising from libertarian considerations requires the elimination of the criminal law as we know it
Finally I will argue that libertarian theory as framed by Nozick can not offer any justification for capital punishment but certain categories of wrongdoers
Along the way I will contend that some of these unexpected results arise due to the exiguous grounding provided for the libertarian scheme of justice by Nozick and I will suggest that their resolution requires a more robust ethical foundation
That recommended foundation however will only advance the case for compensatory remedies where restitution is not available
It will not provide support for criminal sanctions as we traditionally conceive of them

Remediation and Justice
In order to determine which theory of remediation is entailed by the libertarian thesis it will be necessary to formulate the view of justice which is expounded in that thesis and the concomitant theory of wrongdoing which is implied by it
Justice as conceivedof by libertarian theorists consists in the preservation of one s freedom of action with respect to those objects to which one has legitimate title
These objects include one s person and those extrapersonal objects which one has justly acquired
To such objects the holder has exclusive title
Another category and unappropriated extrapersonal objects as long as these actions are taken in accordance with certain rules which assure to all actors compatible spheres of autonomy
So defined this conception of justice implicitly specifies what sorts of actions are not in agreement with it ie are unjust those which consist in the use of objects to which one does not have appropriate title but to which another person does or in the damage ie the alteration of such objects
Thus actions in any society governed by strict application of libertarian principles will be considered rightful if they are taken with respect to objects owned by their users if they are taken with respect to objects wherein permission has been voluntarily granted by the owner to another person to make use of them or if they are taken with respect to objects over which as in the case of unowned and unappropriated objects one has certain usufructuary rights
Actions which employ or alter objects not owned by their may employ suitable defenses to prevent or resist such actions
While the question of what would constitute a suitable defense is interesting enough the principal focus of this paper will be on what the appropriate ie the just response to a successfully completed unjust action of this kind ought to be
Such a response could conceivably fall into one of three broad categories responses which seek recompense for the victim those which attempt solely to affect in some way the wrongdoer or some combination of the two
Furthermore it is clear that unjust actions can affect either one s extrapersonal holdings or oneself or both
While it is obvious at least in outline what kinds of acts would be impermissible within a code of entitlementprotecting statutes the sanctions that would be provided for in that code are not immediately evident
Would the law confine itself to the compensation of offended parties or would it alternatively or additionally provide for punitive sanctions Would the latter if a disrupted moral balance by exacting a retribution or would they be assigned in order to prevent instances of wrongdoing in the future And if punitive remedies are inappropriate to an entitlement conception of justice what sanctions would conform to it in cases of personal injury where the realized harm was intended by its perpetrator and more problematically in the limiting case of murder
Generally we can say that if any category of attempted remedial action systematically fails to restore a transgressed entitlement it can not be the response required by the libertarian theory of justice because it fails to redress the particular injustice identified by that theory
That is there may be other grounds for recommending such a response but they are not ones provided by the libertarian thesis
Furthermore if a suggested response to wrongdoing itself violates someone s rights it is forbidden by this theory of justice

The Nature of Rightful Entitlement
The appropriate response to various categories of wrongdoing according to entitlement theory must be of a rightful action in an entitlement context
Such an analysis is embodied in the following principles Definition of Rightful Title A title to a human object is rightful if and only if it is claimed with respect to one s own person
A title to a nonhuman object is rightful if and only if it is acquired by Nozick s principle of justice in acquisition NJA or Nozick s principle of justice in transfer NJT
A rightful title to an object O under description D is retained by its owner even if O is transformed to On under Dn
Rightful title to any object is attained only by 
Definition of RightfulUse Actions An action a is rightful and hence permissible if the actor A employs objects human or nonhuman to which he has rightful title
An action a is rightful and hence permissible if the actor A employs previously untitled objects according to NJA
An action a employs objects to which he does not have title with the uncoerced permission of those who do and only in ways specified by them
No action is permissible except when performed in accordance with 
Principles of RightfulTransformation Actions An object O may be transformed to On by an actor A if he has rightful title to it
An untitled object Ou may be transformed to Oun by an actor A according to and only according to NJA
An object which is owned by another may be transformed with and only with the uncoerced permission of its rightful owner and only in ways specified by him
No act of transformation is rightful except when performed in accordance with 
We conclude then that a wrongful action is one which violates the Principles of RightfulUse Actions or the Principles of RightfulTransformation Actions
The wrong produced consists either of the illicit use of an object belonging to another the illicit transformation of an object belonging to another of an unowned object The wrongful act emerging from is implicitly defined by NJA
Since NJA is a largely undeveloped principle within contemporary entitlement theory and a subject of great controversy we will not attempt to characterize the wrongful act generated by violations of it
However the wrong described by clearly consists in depriving the rightful owner of the use of his object O from time t to tn while the wrong delineated by consists in depriving the rightful owner of the use of his object O from t to tn and leaving him with the use of the altered object On to which he retains title
In the former case he has been deprived of the use and fruits of using O from t to tn only
In the latter case he has been deprived of the use and fruits of the use of O permanently beginning at t and obtained the use of which he was deprived in both instances were rightfully his the commission of the wrongful act in either case requires that these uses and effects be restored to him
However as they can not be perfectly restored to him in either case since the time interval during which he was deprived of the object s use is permanently lost to him and the object in the second case has been altered he has the right to claim their imperfect or approximate restoration
Once this restoration has taken place then according to entitlement theory the entitlement has been restored and hence the wrong however imperfectly and approximately has been remedied

Nonutilitarian Compensation
Before considering whether any further ie punitive response to wrongful actions of type or can be claimed on libertarian grounds I will examine a dilemma which it has been alleged accompanies the libertarian theory of remediation as it pertains to restitution
Lawrence Davis has argued that the restitutionism implied by libertarian a good many small injustices
""
""
to be declared unrectifiable Davis s argument is that Nozick s entitlement theory identifies a particular distribution of holdings as
just if and only if each person s holdings under some distribution Dx includes and only includes those particular objects to which he is entitled by Nozick s principle of justice in acquisition transfer and rectification
But assume says Davis that I steal a banana which rightly belongs to you and eat it
Thereafter he argues no just distribution can be achieved for your entitlement was to a particular banana which no longer exists
No rectification is possible since your stolen entitlement can not be returned to you
A theory of remediation which provides no possible remedy for such transgressions would appear profoundly deficient
Davis suggests that rather than agree to such consequences Nozick might appeal to the theory of compensation delineated by him in Part I of Anarchy State and Utopia
There a person who has been indifference curve as he would have been on had the transgression not taken place and this constitutes compensation for the transgression Nozick might Davis argues replace the notion of remediation as having one s particular property returned to one with the following criterion of rectification the transgressed entitlement has been restored if the victim is indifferent between a compensated present state and a past state untainted by any transgression of entitlements
According to this substitute principle goods which make the offended party indifferent between the destroyed holdings to which he was entitled and those used to compensate him for their loss constitute a legitimate recompense
While this latter principle solves the problem of finding a suitable remedy when one s entitlements no longer exist or are damaged beyond repair its adoption threatens to eviscerate the whole of the historical entitlement thesis Indeed if utility is to be substituted for entitlement in the principle of rectification why not substitute it for the other two divisions of Nozick s theory of distributive justice justice in the acquisition of every member of society between past and present holdings is a suitable substitute for the historical entitlement criteria of distributive justice then there are no morally inflexible claims of individuals to particular objects
The abandonment of entitlement criteria of distribution in one part of the theory may be the genesis of a slippery slope which threatens its other parts
For example suppose I forcibly prevent you from acquiring an object but then compensate you such that you are indifferent between the holdings that without my intervention you would have had and the compensation that I have given you
Entitlement theory proscribes such forcible interferences whereas this utilitarian substitute would permit them provided that the victim is suitably compensated
Similarly transfers of property could be forcibly prevented and fully justified if the requisite compensatory actions were taken by the aggressor
Nozick then appears caught on the horns of a dilemma
The entitlement theory strictly applied would allow certain wrongs to go unrectified while the utilitybased theory of compensation which could extricate the entire theory
This particular dilemma seems to be resolvable
I will argue that if the theory of rights which Nozick defends but does not deduce from any more fundamental moral or factual thesis is given a particular type of justification then utility can indeed be introduced to solve the remediation problem without thereby jeopardizing the integrity of Nozick s libertarian commitment in other spheres of distributive justice
While I can only schematically present the sort of justification for libertarianism that will reconcile these apparently disparate elements this presentation should be sufficient to indicate how a utility criterion for the rectification of wrongs can be infused into the body of Nozick s rights theory without mortally wounding it
Rights are sometimes described as social conditions necessary for the satisfaction of certain commonly held but separately sought objectives
For example in Reason and Morality Alan Gewirth argues that rights are social claims which are deducible from the fact that human beings by nature strive to fulfill purposes
Similarly Loren Lomasky in Persons Rights necessary social conditions to which hypothetical contractors would agree in order to realize their longrange personal projects
According to Gewirth s theory these rights are identical in content for every person because the social conditions required for purpose fulfillment are determined by certain universal features of human nature
Thus the rights which logically must be claimed by human beings can not vary from person to person
If this Gewirthian sort of argument could be so revised as to support Nozick s rights of historical entitlement then the property rights of libertarian theory would have been justified as the conditions which must be rationally claimed as necessary means to purpose fulfillment
Probably given the moral theory adumbrated in Philosophical Explanation Nozick himself would not defend property rights in this way
However my point here is that such a defense can conceivably be devised for the rights propounded in Anarchy State and Utopia
Gewirth for example argues that freedom of action is a necessary condition of purpose fulfillment
One can imagine a defended by Nozick
Indeed Lomasky makes just such an argument in his book
That is suppose it is maintained that the satisfaction of purposes requires the possession of the material means necessary to such satisfaction
It could be further argued that such means are only produced by the efforts of specific individuals and that in order to assure their availability for purpose fulfillment to those who produced them or traded for them absolute title to them must be guaranteed to those persons
Where that guarantee is transgressed by theft it would follow from the entitlement thesis itself that the stolen object be returned to its owner
But where the stolen object has been destroyed or consumed and hence can not be returned it would seem that an argument for suitable recompense could be devised which would have the same logical lineage as the purposebased deduction of the generic rights of historical entitlement
That is if it could be argued that absolute property rights are necessary to satisfy the purposes of those who fashioned the property stolen objects can not be returned to their owners substitute objects which equally satisfy the owners purposes would serve them as legitimate recompense
One way of measuring equal satisfaction would be the indifference criterion proposed by Nozick
If it could be further contended that the transgressor incurs an obligation to make recompense because of his transgression then he is obligated to supply whatever substitute will raise his victim to the appropriate indifference curve
And that substitute because it is required to replace the transgressed entitlements of the victim can no longer be claimed by the transgressor as his legitimate property
Its transfer from transgressor to victim rectifies an unjust distribution of goods by removing from the transgressor s holdings goods which he owes to his victim in virtue of his transgression and to which therefore he is no longer entitled
Such a justification might enable Nozick to retain the criterion of historical entitlement in all areas of distributive concern except in those instances of rectificatory justice in which the object no longer exists For there the he would have otherwise experienced in virtue of his possession of objects to which he and only he was rightfully entitled and of which he was illegitimately deprived
On this view the principle of historical entitlement must be upheld as the means necessary for purpose fulfillment generally
However when an entitlement has been illegitimately destroyed and the guilty party has thereby incurred an obligation to make recompense to his victim it is appropriate that a satisfying substitute be conveyed to the victim from the transgressor s holdings because the transgressor in virtue of his obligation no longer strictly retains title to those of his possessions which could be used to remedy his wrongdoing and the purposes of his victim which were previously satisfied by the destroyed entitlement can be equally satisfied by a portion of the transgressor s assets
Thus it is plausible to think that Nozick s theory of compensation could be integrated into his doctrine of rectification without thereby eviscerating the entire entitlement thesis
""
The Entitlement Theory and Punishment
appropriate punitive measures for wrongdoing without undercutting the entitlement theory In his Philosophical Explanations Nozick is unequivocal in his support for retributive punishment while throughout Anarchy State and Utopia he seems to assume that there is no theoretical opposition between his libertarianism and punitive remedies for wrongdoing
We may test the correctness of this assumption by answering two questions
First can punishment whether employed for deterrence incapacitation or retribution be derived as a principle of remediation from libertarian theory Second if it can not be so derived is punishment at least compatible with libertarian principles
Let us consider the two types of wrongdoing to which we previously alluded the illicit use of an object belonging to another and the illicit tranformation of an object belonging to another
Let us expand the second category of wrongdoing so as to include the illicit destruction or consumption of objects
Restated then 
would proscribe the illicit transformation destruction or consumption of libertarian theory endorses both a principle of selfentitlement as well as a principle of the historical entitlement of human beings to nonhuman objects let us be careful to understand that and apply both to human and nonhuman objects
Now we may ask once restitution or compensation for wrongs or has been achieved can any further remedy for them be exacted on entitlement grounds This is our derivation question
The answer to this question seems to be no
If the removal of an entitlement is the wrong created restoration of that entitlement or suitable compensation for its loss is the only possible remedy that can serve as a moral corrective
As for the possible imprisonment of the wrongdoer such an action must be instrumental to the restorative process in order to be given an entitlement justification
If for example it could be argued that a thief would not make his victim whole unless incarcerated and compelled to do so then his imprisonment would be The entitlement theory then would seem to sanction only restitution or compensation as an appropriate moral response to wrongdoing
Punishment when not implemented as a means of either restoring transgressed entitlements or producing recompense for them becomes a morally superfluous exercise
Since the wrongful act must always be measured only in terms of its effects upon the offended holder or his duly appointed beneficiaries of an entitlement any action taken either purely in order to punish the wrongdoer or to prevent or inhibit future criminal actions while it may be morally compatible with the libertarian criterion of justice receives no additional support from it
These two points require further elaboration
First there is the matter of punishment
It might be argued that entitlement theory in fact does entail some retributivist component as it must or ought to distinguish between degrees of culpability by adding to compensatory remedies punitive ones as well
Surely it may be contended the law should not assign the same sanction for manslaughter as it does for murder is identical the extent of responsibility for each offense differs vastly
Libertarian theory it can be maintained ought to recognize this difference by insinuating a retributive constituent into its conception of criminal justice
But while the libertarian theorist is not precluded from acknowledging the full spectrum of moral culpability which can attend any harmful act there is no room for the inclusion of the culpability factor in his formulations of just responses to wrongdoing
Injustice consists wholly in illicit taking or damage
Hence justice must consist exclusively in replacement restoration or compensation from a specific individual or individuals
Furthermore any additional action taken against the person or holdings of a wrongdoer beyond what is required either for the restoration of taken or damaged entitlements to the victim or for the compensation of the victim where restoration is impossible will result in a violation of the rights of the wrongdoer not a justifiable remedial response to his wrongdoing
Thus if an object belonging to A is taken forcibly from him by B a suitable remedy would be the return of the object plus the return of whatever benefits would have accrued to A during its absence and the compensation for any consequential damages suffered by A as a result of its removal
The principle involved here is that A s entitlements and their fruits to which ceteris paribus he would also be entitled were illicitly taken by B and therefore are owed to him by B However to take more from B than was removed or damaged by him is to take from him what is owned by him and is not owed by him to anyone else
Criminal debt on entitlement grounds can only arise from the nonconsensual taking or alteration by someone of an entitlement that is not his
Once that debt is discharged by the wrongdoer any additional forcible taking of objects including his physical person owned by the wrongdoer constitutes the illicit seizure of an unencumbered entitlement and hence is itself a wrongdoing
Punitive reaction to the nonconsensual use of the wrongdoer s entitlements is itself a wrong and as such requires restitutive remedy
And if this is true for punishment which seeks retribution from the actor for his moral error then it is true as well for punishment whose purpose is to deter or prevent by incapacitation or forcible rehabilitation the commission of future wrongful acts
Therefore entitlement theory not only fails to provide justification for punitive measures which exceed what is required to make rightful restitution andor compensation but it implies the wrongfulness of such measures
Thus the answer to our second question is that the use of punishment as a remedy for wrongdoing is incompatible with libertarian theory
Now this implication is surprising enough suggesting as it does that libertarian theorists must argue for the elimination of the criminal law leaving only tort and contract law in its place
However a still stronger result becomes apparent when one begins to consider what sort of sanction libertarian theory can endorse for murder
While libertarian theory could subscribe to the view the victim for the loss of the future estate to which they would have been titled and that he must suffer the loss of sufficient freedom to assure the fulfillment of that obligation it can hardly recommend that in addition he lose his life
For what would be restored in the process The life of his victim would not thereby be recovered nor would the murderer s execution restore or repair any of the entitlements of the victim s heirs
For these heirs were not entitled to the victim who like all human beings is according to libertarian theory entitled to himself
Moreover once these heirs have been compensated no further debt remains to be discharged
The execution of the murderer then would not only fail to serve a compensatory purpose it would be wrong as well for it would deprive the murderer of his entitlement to his physical person
It may be maintained against this disturbing result that the murderer having taken the life of another own life implying the appropriateness or the absence of the inappropriateness of his execution or at least of his imprisonment beyond the term necessary to assure the recompense of the victim s heirs
But what would be the basis of such a claim within libertarian theory Perhaps the libertarian could contend that in taking the life of his victim the murderer created a debt which can only be discharged through the taking of his own life
But to whom would this debt be owned Certainly the libertarian entitlement theorist can not argue that the debt is owed the family or heirs of the victim for the entitlement conception adheres to the view that each person and therefore the victim is the exclusive owner of his own person
Similarly the debt can not be literally owed the victim who is obviously in no position to collect
Nor can the debt be owed to society its members have not been deprived of any of their entitlements through this murder
Only one circumstance might grounds
If someone unsuccessfully attempts to murder but nevertheless injures another and his victim requires the transplantation of an organ in order to survive the injury that organ may be wrested from the attacker even if that should jeopardize the assailant s own life
If without the transfer of his own life to another the assailant will have successfully deprived another of his existence then the attacker becomes a debtor whose life if need be may be taken to restore the life of his victim
Given the radical restorationism implied by the libertarian entitlement theory it is not surprising that one of its adherents has defended restitution as a substitute for punishment in the allocation of criminal justice
What Randy Barnett in an essay arguing for the elimination of retributivist and utilitarian standards of criminal justice did not do was to explicitly link his restitutionism to the entitlement theory so obviously embraced by him
What is surprising is that one of his critics also a libertarian entitlement theorist has maintained
that the civil remedy by itself is altogether inadequate in the case of criminal acts
For the element missing from the mere tort but present in the criminal act is the guilty mind
The criminal has not simply harmed you
He has affronted your dignity
He has intentionally used you against your will for his own ends
He can not simply pay damages as though his action were accidental or unintentional
How would this right the wrong 
Therefore Pilon argues
The original act thus creates a right in the victim to use the criminal as he himself was used
Only so will the parties be treated as equals
For only so will the character of the original act be reflected in the remedy 
Now this argument is ingenious it may even be correct
However in order for it to go through Pilon must transcend the entitlement conception of justice that manifestly informs his views for it simply is not implied by that conception counted among one s entitlements or holdings as Nozick calls them an affronted dignity can not constitute a damaged property
However dignity may be characterized its status as a holding is dubious for it is neither a mental capacity like intelligence judgment memory nor a physical one
If dignity is not a holding or property its damage does not create a debt in its assailant that may be claimed by the affronted party
Clearly the libertarian entitlement theory alone will neither support nor tolerate punitive remedies
If such remedies are desirable on other ground adherents of the libertarian entitlement theory must import other complementary principles on which to make a defense of them or abandon the entitlement theory altogether
If the former appears unattainable and the latter is unattractive the libertarian theoretician must be content with restitutive or compensatory means of rectifying injustice
Jeffrey Paul
Social Philosophy and Policy Center Bowling Green State University
John Locke believed that each person has a natural right to hold property particularly the fruits of his own labor It is through the mixing of one s own labor with land and its products that a right to appropriate and own property arises
But that right as we all know was subject to what Robert Nozick called and what has since become familiar as Locke s Proviso
 Thus an integral part of Locke s defense of private property turned on its omnipresent availability for appropriation in the state of nature
That is there must be unclaimed land as well as the produce of land free for the taking
The original appropriation of property by one person can be just only if enough and as good is available to the rest of humanity 
Enough and as Good The Proviso in the State of Nature
What did Locke mean by his Proviso More specifically how egalitarian was it meant to be of nature the less it would seem able to justify unequal property rights under conditions of scarcity 
Locke puts forward his proviso in at least three places in his famous Chapter V In the first appearance he says
 For this labour being the unquestionable Property of the Labourer no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to at least where there is enough and as good left in common for others emphasis added
In the second he says
 Nor was this appropriation of any parcel of land by improving it any prejudice to any other man since there was still enough and as good left and more than the yet unprovided could use emphases in original
The third version is much less often identified and discussed but is nonetheless a clear formulation of the Proviso
A Man could appropriate property by mixing his labor with it
 so that to entrench upon the right of another or acquire to himself a property to the prejudice of his neighbor who would still have room for as good and as large possession after the other had taken out his as before it was appropriated emphasis added
Do these three formulations imply that individuals in the state of nature must be equal in property holdings however we interpret property holdings Some writers suggest that a condition of equality in the stock of land and produce of the land must exist after an appropriation
In all cases hereafter I mean by an appropriation of land a Lockean appropriation performed by mixing one s labor with it
Alan Ryan follows other contemporary commentators and translates the Proviso as requiring as much and as good being left to others even though Locke never uses such a formulation
Vincent Barry requires that in the state of nature two conditions exist the individuals are equal where this second condition clearly refers to some sort of equality of resources 
Could Locke have meant by enough and as good that equal amounts of property must be available to each person to appropriate in the state of nature Could he have meant that people actually must appropriate and thereafter own equal amounts of property For if either requirement were part of Locke s starting point equality of resources looms far larger as a desideratum for Locke than we might otherwise think
This in turn might weaken a broadly Lockean commitment to strong property rights in poststateofnature conditions of relative scarcity ie where the Proviso does not hold
This is precisely the direction taken by Virginia Held Vincent Barry and others as we shall see
What then could Locke have meant by enough and as good Enough whatever else can not mean an equal amount
It refers to some other characteristic of what by he who has already appropriated land or goods of the land
It seems to compare what others have before an appropriator call him A appropriates and what those same others have after A s appropriation and whether their position has been worsened
It could mean that there must be enough left that those who have not yet appropriated land do not have so little left as to make them suffer physical deprivation for lack of property
But there is no textual evidence for this
A more demanding requirement would be that others are no worse off for the appropriation
This I believe is clearly what Locke means
In the second formulation of the Proviso Locke adds a strong conjunct to enough and as good
That is there must still be more left than those who have not yet appropriated could use
So if they had more than they could use before an appropriation and more than they could use after then relative amounts as appropriate are irrelevant 
The third formulation gives added credibility to this reading because it requires as large a possession left to be appropriated
And clearly here Locke means not as large as that appropriated by A but as large as was there before the appropriation
But how could as large a possession be left after some of it had been appropriated Obviously only if the amount of land and its produce was practically unlimited so that a single appropriation makes no practical difference to the amount still available
Indeed Locke tells us just this in a passage following the second formulation
So that in effect there was never less left for others because of his enclosure for himself
For he that leaves as much as another can make use of does as good as take nothing at all emphasis added
A few lines later he compares such enclosure of land to taking a drink out of a river
Does it make any practical sense to say that What could Locke mean by as good which appears in all three formulations of the Proviso It can not mean as much as A has appropriated since then the force of enough or as large in the third formulation would be nugatory
The preposition as must compare ex ante and ex post situations of those having not yet appropriated all those except A
It seems a simple requirement that the quality of the land which is left be the same
This makes an important point because Locke believes in the enormous multiplicative effect of labor upon land
One reason why the Proviso can plausibly be effective in the state of nature in addition to the vast amount of land available is that mixing labor with land so increases its value and the rewards reaped from it
Locke begins by saying labor can increase the value of land tenfold then a hundredfold and at one point a thousandfold The point is that of inequality than any slight discrepancies in size of original appropriation
If you appropriate two acres while I appropriate only one and we both leave our land unimproved you have twice what I do But if I get maximum value out of my land by great industry and application of reason I might end up with times your wealth while owning only half your original amount of property
Locke however makes clear that he is totally indifferent to even such radical disparities in wealth so that equality per se must be completely irrelevant to him 
The remarkable power of labor to produce so vast a multiplication of wealth might help explain the force of as good
Locke clearly thinks of property in Chapter V as real property and its products
Thus he must require that the acreage left is as responsive to labor inputs as it was before an appropriation else the overwhelming force of labor inputs to create wealth could be lost
I submit then by that as original value to labor improved value
Concretely for agriculture he means as fertile and arable
""
There is yet another way that labor improvement can make up for relatively slight inequalities in sizes of original appropriation
While there is no money and thus no sophisticated commerce we can assume that there is barter and there is some textual evidence of wage employment Locke makes clear that the labormixing appropriators are net benefactors to the rest of mankind
Barter and wage labor are probably the mechanisms he has in mind In a simple premoney economy barter allows some specialization to emerge producing at least some gains from trade and the division of labor
This improves the lot of all
It therefore seems clear that Locke s concerns within the state of nature are Paretian
That is Am I better off or left the same after A appropriates his land or does his appropriation make me worse off
Locke s concerns are not egalitarian
He is not concerned with A This bears powerfully upon arguments which use the force of the Proviso outside the state of nature
Let us see how this is so
A Moral Problem in the Acquisition of Property Outside the State of Nature
Needless to say the state of nature is a fiction in most societies there is no longer a frontier which constitutes such a source of unclaimed property
It would surely seem then that there is no source of unclaimed new property
If this is correct we can only acquire property from some fixed finite stock all of which is already claimed by our fellows
It may seem that I can accumulate property ultimately becoming wealthy only by getting that additional property from others
The means of obtaining such increments of wealth may have to be somehow illicit
We shall investigate that possibility below
But ignoring that problem for the moment it would still seem that such accumulation of property might deny others their fair share ie access out that after the invention of money I can accumulate property beyond my own ability to use or consume it So far as this accumulation of property might deny others enough and as good as it appears it could without a source of free unappropriated property it violates Locke s Proviso 
Indeed this argument has been made both against the notion of private property as a right and against capitalism as a system dependent upon that right
Virgnia Held says
Even more serious for this attempt to justify moral rights to property is the dificulty that the Lockean proviso in the contemporary world of overpopulation and scarce resources can almost never be met
Instead more property for some will almost always bring about less for other emphasis added
Vincent Barry has taken the same position
As they capitalists accumulate more and more property there is less and less for others
The relative positions of the parties with respect to property is not equal necessity lost Perhaps Locke provided an adequate defense of property in a hypothetical state of nature in which supply is inexhaustible and individuals are equal but that blissful Eden does not exist
And yet modern capitalism seemingly operates as if it does emphases added
Note the zerosum nature of property accumulation assumed by both Held and Barry
I acquire more property only by taking property from you and all others
Similar positions which suggest but do not explicitly state this argument are taken by Laurence Becker and AM Honore 
This analysis if it can be maintained constitutes a devastating moral argument against private property
If Held and Barry are correct there are only two kinds of transfers of property
The first are the sort of justicepreserving transfers of entitlements to property envisioned by Nozick
However for Held and Barry these transactions must be for equal value and can not explain the unequal accumulation of property
Thus you swap something to which you are justly entitled for entitled Such transfers are zerosum in the sense that neither of us gained or lost ie gains andor losses equalled zero The kind of transfers which Held and Barry describe are also zerosum the law calls the conversions
More property for some brings about less for others Held tells us
As one has gained the other has lost says Barry
That is I get something from you for nothing they are zerosum because I am ahead some amount and you lose an equal amount 
With the exception of the unusual case of an intentional gift this kind of transfer is by definition wrongful presumably carried out by force or fraud or at least exploitation of mistake or imprudence
Thus any inequality in a freemarket society and there is undeniably a great deal condemns the source of the inequality as the result of something morally very similar to theft
Thus this line of argument proceeds the system constitute the source of this inequality
Ergo the system is based upon immoral or at the very least morally unjustified conversions
One reason why it seems clear that Held and Barry assume this zerosum theory is the one example adduced by both
Barry gives the enclosure movement as a case of capitalists getting rich by taking from others
It is the perfect historical example of their theory of inequality being produced by zerosum transfer Indeed that Barry chooses the enclosure movement as the primary example of property accumulation reveals how deep the zerosum notion is in this view
Let us set out briefly and roughly how the enclosure movement transpired Under feudal tenure much of the land in a manor was common
That is tenants could use it for pasturage and in some cases for crops subject to various feudal duties owed to the lord
All of the rights duties and privileges involved were deeply feudal in character
The peasants rights were either customary or the notion of legal title evolved toward modern fee simple the lord s ownership became more absolute and less burdened with these customary peasant claims
At the same time a huge market for wool developed
Thus it became profitable for the lord to enclose these commons and run his own sheep thereby ignoring the peasants customary rights Generally the newly emerging law of property supported this revocation of old and often only customary rights
Indeed during the eighteenth century private acts of Parliament expedited the process 
Note that it takes only a small abstraction from this example to reach something like a Lockean state of nature
Heretofore the commons was owned in common though with unequal privileges and benefits
Then Lord Bad encloses appropriates the land as his exclusive property denying its use to Peasants Good Nice and Kind
Antecedently Bad Good Nice and Kind had let us say acres to use
Now and Kind are out acres ex ante owned in common
I think we must agree with Barry if we assume custom can be a source of rights which I do that the enclosure movement at least as here simplistically represented constitutes a wrongful as well as a zerosum taking
But what would make Barry and Held as well believe that the enclosure movement is characteristic of capitalist property acquisition or accumulation Indeed prima facie it seems dramatically atypical
Property usually changes hands for valuable consideration
How could they arrive at this conclusion Let us see
What is the nature of the wrong in such conversions as the enclosure movement It may well be that the wrong is deontological in nature a violation of a right to property
Where Nozick sees such conversions this is the only reason for their wrongfulness although for Nozick the class of wrongful conversions is much narrower than for Held and Barry But there are ones
First such transfers will lead to relative inequality
This would be a problem for Held and Barry but not for Locke as we saw nor for Nozick nor for the author Held and Barry are egalitarians with respect to transactions
Locke Nozick and the author are Paretians
However most would agree Held and Barry included that there is a second and more serious consequential wrong in a world without the frontier ie with a closed and finite stock of property
That is sufficient inequality might well lead to physical deprivation and suffering as it will not in Locke s state of nature since sufficient land and its produce was always present there to prevent it
Thus on this account in the closed finite property case I can accumulate two more units of property only by denying them to you and to everyone else on the assumption that antecedently you had their use and enjoyment
Think of the enclosure example where great is denied you and very little or none left for you then you might well have so little that you suffer
It is the physical deprivation and poverty that results from this kind of unequal distribution which virtually everyone finds objectionable
That Locke found it so is illustrated by his Proviso requiring enough viz at least to avoid deprivation while we interpreted Locke to mean something much stronger than this by enough it certainly includes a prohibition on physical deprivation
Let us now state their view explicitly and concisely
The HeldBarry Thesis The accumulation of property outside the state of nature in the hands of one person logically requires the denial of an equal amount of property to others lessening their stock of property by the amount accumulated by the first person
This accumulation and denial pursued far enough will lead to deprivation and suffering
The RealProperty Paradigm
The HeldBarry thesis logically depends upon what we might call a zerosum characteristic of property
This is land outside the state of nature where there is no frontier
All of Locke s thought seems to be based on the identification of property with land and the agricultural products of land although this distinction is not always made clear
Other early modern discussions of property also depend upon its identification with land 
What are the zerosum characteristics of land as archetypal property There are three salient logical characteristics of real property
First if I own a oneacre piece of property Blackacre let us call it I have a right to prevent you and all others from owning or using that specific parcel of land
Second without a practically unlimited source of property ie a frontier there is a finite and limited amount of land The amount is fixed ie it will neither grow nor shrink
As my farmer neighbors in Ohio say They ai nt makin any more of it
Third from the first reduces the total stock of land by one acre which is available to you to use or acquire without payment
These three characteristics together create a zerosum conception of property
I gain one acre you and everyone else lose one
That just is zerosum in the very same sense as Lord Bad s appropriation denied the appropriated land to Peasants Good Nice and Kind in the enclosure case set out above
Thus it is your being excluded in this way from enough land where there is nt unappropriated land for you to acquire which might lead to your suffering physical deprivation
The kind of transfers of property contemplated by Held and Barry being based on the realproperty paradigm are zerosum
What logical prerequisites must exist in order to have private property characterized by the realproperty paradigm Any property that can be held in private must be excludable as we saw with Blackacre above
That is it must be possible to exclude others from its use and enjoyment
Indeed public goods those things that are not subject to privatization eg clean air Excludability seems to be entailed by the very nature of the economic conception of private property
It is also central to the legal conception of private property Of course the economist s and the lawyer s notions differ in that the former concerns the practical physical ability and therefore the cost to exclude while the latter has to do with the normative power to exclude
As we saw above there is a closely related but distinct characteristic entailed by the zerosum conception of property which is often confused with excludability
If I claim Blackacre as my own excludability will insure that no one else can own use or enjoy without suitable permission that particular piece of land viz Blackacre
But a conceptually separate thing happens as well as a result of that property claim
The total stock of land available to be used or appropriated is decreased by one acre
This notion is sometimes and Barry conflate my denying you Blackacre with my denying you one acre lessening the stock available to you by one
That is they treat them as the same thing In the real property paradigm they are the same thing but only within that paradigm
Let us see if we can make these conditions explicit
Spelled out formally we may say that the zerosum characteristics of property are defined by The exclusion condition Ownership of P a specific individually identifiable piece of property ie P is a name by A implies that all others those not A are excluded from possession and use of P without the permission of A The finitude condition There are only n things of type P of which P is a token in the world where n is a practically finite number ie small enough to offer genuine constraint scarcity in the economist s sense
From and we condition A s ownership of P implies that there exists only n other things of P s type for all others to own
As one would expect the real property paradigm using these three conditions works extremely well for land with no frontier outside the state of nature
Indeed the stipulation of no frontier or outside the state of nature just is the introduction of the finitude condition
How well do these three conditions work for other sorts of property Nonrenewable resources are by definition finite in quantity and that makes all tangible personal property in some very abstract sense limited
However that finitude often makes little difference in dividing up the world so to speak
The stock of many though not all nonrenewable resources is indefinitely large far more like land in the frontier case than in the modern nonfrontier case
For even on the frontier there is a knowledge that the total amount of land is ultimately finite technology and human ingenuity generally can multiply the effective quantity of a given resource many times through more efficient use in production processes and product design
The market is an enormously effective mechanism for sending signals that a given material resource grows more dear
The consequent price increase then drives the aforesaid technology to find replacements or technologies which use less
Nonetheless there is the thesis heard more often in the s than today that we are fast running through our nonrenewable resources
Soon if not now we will find all these resources practically limited
If this is the case then all tangible personal property manufactured from those resources is or soon will be practically limited in amount
For the reasons cited above this claim may not be very realistic
Nonetheless we shall assume that all tangible personal property is practically limited
This constitutes a very strong and I would say highly artificial presumption in favor of Held s and Barry s use of Locke s Proviso argument
Thus tangible personal property is subject to the objection that accumulation leads to deprivation ie I can only get more by denying an equal amount to others
The kinds of property most important to modern Western capitalism however are intangible
The traditional legal distinction between tangible and intangible property is that the former is corporeal and therefore subject to physical dominion while intangible property is incorporeal and abstract
 Intangible property includes patents copyrights trademarks commonlaw trade secrets and the vastly important domain of financial assets such as stocks and bonds
Now comes the central question in this essay Is it possible that for certain sorts of intangible property the exclusion condition may not entail the zerosum condition and thus the attendant zerosum conception of property Held and Barry implicitly answer this question no
Indeed to sustain their thesis they must
For they implicitly assume that all types of property outside the state of nature are characterized which we set out above
This they believe necessarily causes the violation of Locke s Proviso
They reach this conclusion by ignoring the possible independence of the finitude condition and thus by conflating the exclusion condition with the zerosum condition 
But what if for certain sorts of intangible property the excludability condition was independent of the finitude condition and did not by itself entail the zerosum condition Put the question in a different way might there exist intangible property which is at once excludable but inexhaustible in amount If excludable it could be private property ie one could exercise control over it
If inexhaustible it could meet Locke s Proviso
It would satisfy Locke s Proviso in that never mind how much some have already there exists enough and as good for all others
In other words I might have a piece of property from which I can exclude you but there being an unlimited amount you need never suffer privation
You merely go appropriate some for yourself
And this would be true regardless of how much I already have appropriated for myself
Thus the HeldBarry thesis would fail for such a kind of property
The existence of an inexhaustible source of property would have vast moral implications for the justice or injustice of the institution of private property the accumulation of property as wealth and the distribution of that wealth
Let us see how this might be so
The Patent Paradigm
The most obvious if not the most important example of intangible property of this sort is the idea An inventor of my acquaintance holds seventeen patents
These patents are his property every bit as much as my house is mine
True he holds rights to them for a term of years and that makes his ownership a bit more like a leasehold right
But in all other relevant particulars his patents have the salient earmarks of being his property
The most interesting thing I consider it amazing is that he created them ex nihilo
Property was created out of nothing but mental labor He did nt even need raw materials as the farmer needs land and seed or the potter needs clay
Of course he needed a pencil paper a drafting board and a slide rule my friend is an oldfashioned inventor
But these are more like tools
He needed no stuff with which to mix his labor
Do my friend s patented ideas meet the exclusion condition required of all private property Yes they do for no one can use his invention without his approval for which he will normally charge a fee a royalty rather than rent but logically identical to one
So exclusion is both practically possible and normatively effective
Indeed the machinery of the patent law is created precisely to enable him to exclude others from the appropriation or use of any of an inventor s patented ideas
That ownership or use of that idea without his permission
However even in virtue of his exclusion of me from his ideas does it make sense to say there are fewer ideas out there which I now can think up appropriate by a patent and then use Another way of asking this question is do my friend s patents fit the last two parts of the zerosum conception of property What about the finitude condition Let us assume a simpleminded Platonism in which all ideas thought of and not yet thought of appropriated through the patent law and not yet appropriated exist
To be sure there are seventeen fewer unappropriated ideas available for me to appropriate than before my friend started thinking
But has that lowered the stock of unthoughtof and unappropriated ideas still to be thought up at all Certainly not
The number of both notyetthoughtof and notyetappropriated ideas is at least practically unbounded if not infinite
It was nt ever n and it is nt now n constraint
Indeed subtracting seventeen from the number of all the ideas which I could still think up and appropriate does not seem to decrease the total number
This makes the arithmetic of ideas seem very similar to the arithmetic of aleph zero Thus the finitude condition is violated
What about the zerosum condition itself Excludability is enough to ensure that I can not appropriate and can not use without permission any presently extant and patented ideas
Moreover if I do receive a patent on an idea there is one fewer idea out of the finite number already thought up and in existence for others to own and use
If we limit ourselves to the presently extant patented appropriated ideas they behave exactly like Blackacre ie in accord with the realproperty paradigm
However patented ideas are not like real property without a frontier just because as we have seen there is a source of an infinite or indefinitely large number of new ideas which can be thought of appropriated ex nihilo merely by hard and creative thought
I do not have to pay anyone for those new ideas and more importantly when I come up with one the number available to you is not thereby decreased
Thus the zerosum condition is not met
Perhaps most important you are not deprived so long as you remain able and willing to exert mental labor
As it is with patents so it is with copyrights and trademarks
Moreover courts have decided that a number of other sorts of highly abstract things unbounded in quantity or number are property
One interesting example is a Supreme Court decision which held that Associated Press had a property right in the news it had gathered All of these kinds of property share the characteristic that while I can exclude you from the use of mine there is not thereby a smaller amount upon which you can draw to use or own
Moreover as with Locke s real property in the with it here the mental labor of thinking to apropriate it
It is otherwise free as it should be if there is an inexhaustible supply presently unclaimed
Of course issues of distributive justice implicit in the concerns of Held and Barry are not thereby solved for not all of us are intelligent enough or intelligent in the right way to think up ideas of sufficient novelty and value to be worth protection by patent or copyright
Thus we can not all be equal in access to resources
What is even more disturbing for most of us if ideas so construed are the only inexhaustible source of wealth produced by labor is that some of us willing to labor might nonetheless have so little as to suffer physical privation
Held and Barry might also quite rightly point out that there are substantial transaction costs connected with obtaining patents and copyrights
Theoretically this can be construed as part of the cost of recording title rather the cost of perspective however it makes very little difference since
such transaction costs do represent a hurdle to the poor
There is no simple answer to the HeldBarry challenge
The availability of intellectual property may favor the industrious as Locke and the author prefer
But it also favors the intelligent and that is not obviously fair
Moreover as intelligence can be magnified by education and as the transaction cost of recording title to ideas can be high there is some tendency for such property to be more available to the rich or at least the welloff
There is a response however for there is another source of unappropriated property which seems to be even more available to all than intellectual property
Ownership in Business Enterprises
There is no doubt that the notions of the patent or the copyright constitute a different paradigm of property from that of real property in a nonfrontier situation
There also is no doubt that it fits the Lockean notion including the Proviso far
Thus the HeldBarry Thesis fails with respect to it
Yet we assumed for the sake of argument only that other kinds of tangible property at least in theory fit the real property paradigm better
The numbers of bulldozers or bicycles or beer bottles are not unbounded in quite the same way as is intellectual property 
Certainly patents and copyrights are important in our economy but are they more important than all forms of tangible property both real and personal No they are not
But ownership shares in business enterprises eg common stock in corporations along with many similar kinds of property constitute the single most important kind of property interests in our economic system At the very least they constitute the sort of property which capitalism must have in order to be capitalist ie which allows us to accumulate and exchange capital
I wish to claim that the patent paradigm characterizes these most important kinds of property in modern capitalism far better than the realproperty shall limit our discussion to common stock of corporations although I believe a similar analysis could be made of any financial asset
An ownership interest in an enterprise is abstract and intangible in the way required by the patent paradigm
There is excludability in the sense necessary for all private property
That is there are a finite number of ownership shares of corporations presently extant further if I acquire one share of stock my having it denies ownership of that share to any other
Thus if I own all the stock of XYZ Corporation then neither you nor anyone else can own any of it
If I own nine thousand of the ten thousand shares outstanding then you can own at most one thousand
But of course the salient feature of the patent paradigm is that even as I exclude you from ownership of XYZ Corp there are not fewer shares of enterprises in general out there for you to own
Why not Because in an exactly analogous way enterprise through your own efforts and thereby create property ex nihilo or you can purchase the shares of someone who has done this
""
To see how this is so we have only to trace the evolution of such an enterprise
Let us assume that you open a hotdog stand
You use none of your own money instead you rent all of the fixed assets and borrow from a bank to finance the working capital
You are your sole employee
On day one you have zero equity in the business
You have a bit of luck with your location and build a large and faithful clientele
You work hard selling many hot dogs
At the end of a year of work you have made a profit of after paying yourself a meager salary
You then plow all the profits back into the business probably by making principal payments on the bank loan or by buying some of the fixed assets
 In the second and third year you make into the business
At the end of three years you have property worth Where did this property come from From your original idea your efforts and your entrepreneurial activity as much as the ideas covered by the patents came from my friend s head
Moreover your in property did not nor does it lower the stock of the total worth of enterprises out there to be built by others or the value of any other property they may hold
From here one can take the story in a variety of directions
Our entrepreneur might sell his business and then hold in cash or passive investments
He might expand and soon have a business worth 
Whatever the denouement we have seen that Held and Barry are wrong for this case
More property for our enterepreneur did not mean less for anyone else
He has gained and no one has lost
His greater stake of property has come from some source which if we have not yet and did not obviously detract from opportunities others might have for obtaining more property
It is not zerosum in character
But how does this creation of intangible property work Does it really bring such property within the ambit of Locke s Proviso Let us see
An extremely simplified and somewhat simplistic version of the contemporary microeconomic account of how this creation of value occurs might run something like this
We assume you did nt misrepresent your product or defraud your customers by using cheap fillers for example
Thus each time you sold a hotdog you made a customer better off to the extent that their use value for the hotdog was higher than or at the limit at least as high as the exchange value you set on it the price
So long as you keep answering needs or wants for hotdogs at a lower price than what peoples use values for hotdogs are but that remain higher than your costs you are making This account may seem to describe a mysterious process but a moment s reflection will show that it does not
It does however require a commitment to a subjective theory of value If I value something you have more than something I have and you attribute reciprocal values to the two things the potential for a trade exists in which we are both better off and no one else is worse off thus creating a Pareto improvement
The exchange of one hotdog with one customer at a price both you the hotdog entrepreneur and she the customer find acceptable is just such a transaction
Such transactions are the paradigm market phenomena of modern microeconomics 
Profit then occurs when the entrepreneurproducer takes his share of the gain from trade his part of the Pareto improvement
As he accumulates these gains he measures profit in his business
Wealth in the form of intangible property the ownership of a company is just the accumulated profit
Indeed modern worth of this company with its earned surplus or retained earnings
""
Conclusion
Business profit and business growth is or can be if business is transacted ethically value creating which as shares of business enterprises means property creating We have an inexhaustible frontier from which we can continue to appropriate such property without denying anything to our fellow human beings
Indeed the accumulation of wealth in this manner can and should be a Paretoimproving process in that it makes some better off while making no one worse off
As regards the most important kinds of property in a capitalist economic system Locke s Proviso is completely satisfied
Contrary to the HeldBarry thesis nowhere does the accumulation of this kind of property by some necessarily require less property for others
James W Child
Bowling Green State University
A central theme in recent liberal arguments for the freemarket has been an epistemological one
It is claimed that the free market is a solution to problems of ignorance and that there are necessary limitations to the knowledge that any particular individual or subset of individuals in society can possess
Hence there are limitations to the knowledge at the disposal of any central planning board in a planned economy
The economic liberal argues that in contrast to these limitations of centralized planned economies the market overcomes the problems of human ignorance
There are two sources of these limitations to human knowledge that are particularly prominent in the work of economic liberals
The first is what Hayek calls the division of knowledge in society that is the dispersal of knowledge and skills throughout different individuals in society Much of such knowledge takes the form of practical knowledge knowledge how rather than knowledge that which can not be articulated in propositional form
Hence such knowledge can not in principle be passed on dispersed throughout society of which any particular individual or subset of individuals will be ignorant
A second source of ignorance is the unpredictability of human needs and wants
This is in part a consequence of the fact that an individual s needs and wants often can not be articulated
However it also has another basis
Needs and wants change with the invention and production of new objects for consumption
To quote a version of this point from a writer who is not an economic liberal
Production not only provides the material to satisfy a need but it also provides the need for the material The need felt for the object is induced by the perception of the object
An objet dart creates a public that has artistic tastes and is able to enjoy beauty and the same can be said of any other product 
If one also accepts Popper s claim that the progress of human knowledge is in principle unpredictable if we could predict future knowledge we would already have it then it knowledge and wants and needs are created by human invention then human wants and needs are also in principle unpredictable
Hence at any point in time we are ignorant about the full range of future human needs and wants
We have then two sources of ignorance
The economic liberal claims that the market is a solution to the problems presented by this ignorance
With respect to the first source of ignorancethe division of knowledge the problem is that of communicating between different actors that knowledge which is relevant to the coordination of their actions
Its solution requires a mechanism which will convey to each agent the information he must possess in order to adjust effectively his decisions to those of others
 The price system provides such a mechanism
By serving as a numerical index of changes in the relation between the supply and demand for goods it communicates between independent actors the information that is relevant to the coordination of their activities
It does so while allowing each individual to make best With respect to the second source of ignorance the unpredictability of human wants and needs the problem is that of having a discovery procedure for uncovering what such needs and wants will be
Market competition between businesses is presented as such a discovery procedure Just as conjectures about the physical world are tested and falsified by experiments so conjectures about future human needs and wants are tested and falsified by competition in the marketplace
The businesses of those who conjecture wrongly about future needs and wants fail others pass the test although it is possible that at some future date they in turn will find their conjectures falsified in the market
Competition between businesses in the market prallels competition between conjectures in the sciences businesses are realizations of economic conjectures
Such parallels between competition in markets and in the sciences have been developed further in ways which I will discuss later in the paper
The economic liberal claims then that the market solves the problems of human ignorance
In consequence the it possible for a planning body to possess all relevant economic information
Two critical points one might make of this defense of the market are central to this paper
The first concerns the assumption at the base of the argument that there exist only two ways of distributing information in society either through a decentralized market mechanism or through a centralized planning agency
The strength of the epistemological argument for the market depends in part on the implausibility of assuming that all knowledge could be centralized upon some particular planning agency
The argument ignores however the existence of the decentralized but predominantly nonmarket institutions for the distribution of knowledge and information notably the professions in particular the institutions of the scientific community
The contrast between market institutions and the institutions of the scientific community will be the focus of this paper
The second critical point which is particularly relevant in this regard is that the epistemological defense of the market tends to ignore the way in which the market itself is a source of the problem of ignorance market system there is a disincentive to communicate information between actors who are in competition
Put simply if producers A and B are in competition and A informs B of his or her activities and B does not reciprocate then B is in a position to adjust his or her behavior in order to compete more effectively than A In this situation standard game theory applies
While cooperation through mutual communication might be beneficial to both parties if one cooperates and the other does not the noncooperating party benefits
Given that both parties are selfinterested the rational strategy is to act noncooperatively
Noncommunication is a competitively stable strategy One sphere in which such noncommunication between competitors is prevalent in the market is that of scientific and technical knowledge
Competitors in the market as rational actors actively keep novel scientific and technical work nonpublic
A feature of the market is the existence of an incentive to secrecy and confidentiality in technical information
This feature of the market leads to major conflicts where the that associated with the scientific and academic communities
The increasing encroachment of market relations into the scientific community has led to a conflict between the proprietary secrecy of the market and the open communication of traditional science
As Nelkin notes
Conflicts of interest are bound to arise in situations in which university faculty are directly involved in commercial ventures
The academic responsibility of open communication inevitably conflicts with the commercial responsibility to maintain proprietary secrecy 
The details of such conflicts are to be found elsewhere and I will not discuss them in this paper My central concern rather will be with the normative question What is wrong if anything with the employment of market mechanisms in the scientific sphere To what extent if at all should the market play a role in the activities of scientific research and the distribution of the results of such research I will approach these questions by focusing on the differences and possible conflicts between the kind of property system presupposed by paper is composed of two sections
In the first I undertake some necessary preliminary clarification of different senses in which one can talk of intellectual property the sense in which this is presupposed in the context of the market and the sense in which it is presupposed in modern professional science
In doing so I point out some of the confusions in the literature on science studies that arise from mixing these different senses of intellectual property
The analysis in this section takes as its starting point a dispute in the sixteenth century between Tartaglia and Cardano which highlights the differences and conflicts between these distinct systems of intellectual property in a particularly vivid way
This example rather than an example of a modern conflict also has other advantages as a starting point for discussion
In particular it enables us to concentrate on the question of the appropriateness of market relations to science and to avoid an added complexity that arises in the modern context ie that scientists in commercial science the results of their research belong not to themselves but to the corporation that employs them
This feature of the modern situation adds a further dimension to the normative problems of the involvement of markets in science concerning an individual s alienation of rights to the fruits of his or her labor
This issue is an important one but is not one I shall pursue here My sixteenthcentury example lacks this added complication
As an initial example it allows us to focus on the issue of what if anything is inappropriate in the market as an institutional framework for science In the second section I turn to this central issue of the paper whether market mechanisms are appropriate in the scientific domain
I
To understand the dispute between Tartaglia and Cardano requires an examination of the social and economic context of their work
Both mathematicians belonged to the tradition of cossist algebra predominant in Italy and Germany in the sixteenth century
This algebraic tradition was closely linked with the rise of mercantile capitalism and the new textbooks produced in the cossist tradition employed predominantly mercantile examples and often also included detailed economic information alongside the mathematics
Moreover mathematicians like Tartaglia earned an income from the employment of mathematical skills on behalf of merchants
In this context publication of mathematical results often served as a form of advertisement for mathematical skills
Another important form of publicity came from competitions in which mathematicians would set each other problems often with a side bet on the winner
Success in such competitions required novelty in algorithms for the solution of mathematical problems
The origins of the dispute between Tartaglia and Cardano lay in one such competition
Tartaglia had developed an algorithm for solving cubic equations an algorithm which had been developed earlier by Ferro who had kept the solution a secret to himself and a few students
One of these students Fior who had used the algorithm to win a series of mathematical competitions challenged Tartaglia to a contest and lost
On hearing of the contest Cardano sought out Tartaglia and according to Tartaglia at least he was sworn to secrecy
However on finding that the solution had been discovered by Ferro Cardano published Tartaglia s solution in Ars Magna citing Ferro and Tartaglia as independent inventors of the algorithm
Despite this citation Cardano s publication produced a heated response from Tartaglia and a major dispute between Cardano and Tartaglia 
This dispute is significant in that it reveals a contrast in the notions of intellectual property between that predominant within the cossist tradition and that which has developed in science in the succeeding centuries
A comment by Mahoney on the dispute is to the point here
To the modern scholar imbued with the notion that as R K Merton has put it an idea is not really yours until you give it away ie through publication Tartaglia s attitude seems strange
Yet in sixteenthcentury Italy where mathematics was a competitive business among the cossists the attitude is more than reasonable 
Implicit in the dispute views of intellectual property The first illustrated by Tartaglia Ferro and others in the cossist tradition is one associated with the market
Property here involves as MacPherson puts it an individual right to exclude others from the use or benefit of something and relatedly the rights of individuals to transfer some or all of these rights to other individuals
While these rights were not legally enforceable there was clearly an assumption on the part of cossists like Tartaglia that they did involve ethical claims on others
Tartaglia s attitude to his algorithm was that it was in a real sense his and that he had a right to circumscribe the uses which Cardano made of it
More generally it lay at the base of the secrecy that was prevalent in cossist algebra
Mathematics was as Mahoney puts it a competitive business
The second view of intellectual property is the paradoxical Mertonian concept mentioned by Mahoney an idea is not yours until you of intellectual property in science
As a piece of property the research report is a rather unusual object
The property comes into existence only by being made available for use by others 
On this Mertonian view then one makes a claim to intellectual property by making public an independently developed original result
A result that is unpublished is not recognized as yours
Given this view of intellectual property what counts as publication becomes of central importance and significant for this is the growth of the scientific journal as a primary vehicle for publication particularly in the early nineteenth century and the kinds of editorial and peerreviewing processes associated with it It is through publication in journal or book form that one lays a claim to property rights over a theory or result
It might be objected here that there is something problematic in talk of property rights at all
When one talks of property it normally implies rights to use or benefit from a thing ethical force
Given this conception of property the publication of scientific results makes them public or common property the benefit and use of the theory become the right of anyone within the limits of plagiarism and copyright
Einstein s theory of relativity is not the property of any particular individual
It is common property Indeed Merton also refers in this regard to the communism of science
The substantive findings of science are a product of social collaboration and are assigned to the community
They constitute a common heritage in which the equity of the individual producer is severely limited
An eponymous law or theory does not enter into the exclusive possession of the discoverer and his heir nor do the muses bestow upon him special rights of use and disposition 
What sense then is there in talk of an individual claiming intellectual property through the act of publication In a minimum sense it might be noted that we use the possessive in referring to theories Einstein s theory of relativity
However this in itself can not be said to be a basis for talk of property
We can also talk for example of Einstein s haircut without thereby indicating any property relation
If talk of property is to make sense there must be some sense in which the producer of the theory gains certain rights or powers in virtue of the act of publication
The rights which Merton and Ravetz are concerned with in their discussion of intellectual property are rights of recognition most notably through citation and in some cases eponymy and rights to the benefits that accrue from such recognition
Thus Merton continues the quotation above as follows
Property rights in science are whittled down to a bare minimum by the rationale of the scientific ethic
The scientist s claim to his intellectual property is limited to the recognition and esteem which if the institution functions with a modicum of efficiency is roughly commensurate with the significance of the increments brought to the common fund of such recognition
Yet this intellectual property is none the less real and important to those who possess it
As a verification of the scientist s accomplishment it can bring immediate rewards
And as an implicit guarantee of the quality of his future work it brings in interest for some time after its publication 
However I remain uneasy about the way such talk of the rights to recognition and benefits which a producer attains through publication of a theory is cashed out in terms of property rights over the theory
It would seem more appropriate here to talk simply of publication making a theory common property and refer merely to rights to recognition on the side of the producer
The metaphor of the producer s intellectual property is not in itself a problem as long as it is clear what is being said
However problems do arise when the reference to such propertyrights is developed in ways appropriate to its more normal use as private property
Thus for example later discussion of the nature of intellectual property in science
Thus he goes on to argue that citation in addition to other functions represents a payment for use of the material
 The picture here is that of property in the sense in which it is involved within the market in which an individual with exclusive rights to something alienates these property rights in exchange for certain payments from those to whom use of the theory is granted
Indeed Ravetz even goes on to talk of imagining an ideal social contract between producers and users of theories
The metaphor however is inappropriate
If one accepts the Mertonian model of intellectual property as resulting from the publication of a theory an individual does not thereby alienate property rights to the theory on the contrary it is only through the act of publication that it is recognized as that individual s
Moreover as a functional explanation of citation Ravetz s payment model is implausible there is after all nothing Hagstrom s view that academic publication is an instance of giftgiving The concept of giftgiving like that of market exchange assumes a model of property as implying exclusive use of an object
The difference between market exchange and giftgiving is that property rights are alienated to others in the absence of any contractual expectations of repayment by others
There will of course be other kinds of expectation of reciprocal action but failure of such repayment in the case of gifts represents not failure of contract but rather indicates that the personal bond between giver and receiver is not in order hence concepts such as personal slight become appropriate where reciprocal action is absent
The problem with the property metaphor then is that it can result in importing into the sphere of public science concepts of property which are inappropriate
We have then two distinct possible concepts of property in science
First a concept of property appropriate to the market which indeed was found that which is found in professional science in which theories are common property but where the publication of theories by the producer issues in rights of recognition and the benefits of recognition
These two conceptions of property are incompatible in ways illustrated by the TartagliaCardano dispute
As Merton again puts it the communism of the scientific ethos is incompatible with definitions of technology as private property in a capitalist economy
 II
The problems discussed in the previous section concerning the use in the study of science of concepts of property appropriate to the market are theoretical they lead to inadequate descriptive and explanatory models of scientific activity
In this section I turn to the normative question which is central to this paper what if anything is wrong with the employment of market mechanisms in science Is there any reason to suppose that the kind of professional public science that has developed since the sixteenth century should be preferred to the kind of market mechanism that we find for example in the cossist within private firms
There are two kinds of objections that might be raised against the employment of market mechanisms in the knowledge industry
First there are those which claim that there are conditions an item must meet to be the sort of thing that can be a commodity and that scientific theories and information do not meet these necessary conditions
Second there are those which claim that the kind of property relations appropriate to the market necessarily conflict with good scientific practice
In the following I will argue that the first set of objections fail
I then develop and defend some versions of the second
""
The first group of objections which are to be found in the economics literature highlight features of theories and information that appear to entail that they can not be commodities The first and most significant of these is that they can not be alienated one can not it might be argued sell a theory a proof a piece of information and the fruit or a car after the transaction the seller retains the capacity to use and benefit from the good in question
This objection however is premised on a misunderstanding of what it is to alienate property it presupposes a mistaken view of property as a thing and not as a set of rights Clearly it is not possible literally to transfer a theory in an act of exchange in the same way one can if one sells a car or a bag of apples
However to alienate property is not to alienate an object as such but to alienate a set of rights and capacities to use and benefit from an object this is as possible in the case of information and knowledge as it is in the case of commodities such as cars and apples
Indeed the sale of education and training facilities by firms and governments provides a good example of how theoretical and practical knowledge is already partially realized as a commodity
A second difficulty that is claimed for information as a commodity has access to it
Thus for example Arrow writes
There is a fundamental paradox in the determination of demand for information its value for the producer is not known until he has the information but then he has in effect acquired it without cost 
This problem I believe is overdrawn
It is not necessary to know the content of a theory or item of information in order to be able to assess its probable market value
Its potential market value to a purchaser can be measured in terms of behavioral capacities ie in what it enables an individual to do
Indeed it was precisely this point that was part of the rationale for competitions in the cossist tradition
Moreover it is true of most commodities that their quality can only be fully appreciated in the processes of consumption
There is nothing then that is peculiar to theories and information in themselves that makes them inappropriate items for the market If there is a problem with the use of market and information are inappropriate for the market but that the market is inappropriate for the practice of science
""
The second group of objections concerns the ways in which the property relations appropriate to the market undermine good scientific practices
I will develop three of these that market mechanisms are incompatible with the open communication in science which is a necessary condition for the growth of knowledge that the market as an institutional framework for science disassociates the external rewards assigned to a contributor to science from the value of his or her contribution to the development of science that private property in science undermines a commitment to the practice of science
I will begin however by considering a case for the defender of the opposing view that far from
being inappropriate as an institutional framework for science the market has all the features that will make for the best development of science
A good starting point for such a case is the parallel which the the market which I outlined at the start of this paper
Market mechanisms are appropriate to science since they encourage competition between different research groups
Science like business is at its best a competitive enterprise
The virtue of competition in both spheres is that it encourages innovation
The proper argument for competition in science as in business as a means of improving knowledge is that it promotes alternative conjectures and their critical examination 
Indeed it might be noted that my earlier example supports this point
Cossist algebra was important in the development of mathematics
Where mathematics in the universities of the period was moribund the competitive pressures of commerce encouraged a novelty in algorithms of which Tartaglia s work was a notable example
A similar kind of argument might be made for commercial science
For example research work in the pharmaceutical and electronic industries hardly suggests that market competition is a brake on the growth of knowledge
One might argue then that given the competitive nature to it as an institutional framework
An initial point that must be made about this argument is that the references to recent examples of marketbased research just noted are unsatisfactory
Innovative research in the market sector has taken place against the background of a domain of public knowledge
The sciences have operated within a mixed economy basic scientific research has been carried out within the public professional domain commercial research has been parasitic on this public domain
The problem which is increasingly a practical as well as a theoretical one is whether public science is a necessary condition for scientific development or whether it is possible for all science to take place within a market economy
As Nelkin notes of new liaisons between professional science and commercial enterprise
Academic science has been a public resource a repository for ideas and a source of relatively unbiased information
Industrial connections blur the distinctions between corporations and the university establishing private control over a public resource
Problems of secrecy and proprietary rights are inherent in these new the public interest 
This raises the first and central objection to the market as an institutional framework for science touched on at the beginning of this paper
There is in a competitive market economy a disincentive to communicate information
The market encourages secrecy which is inimical to openness in science It presupposes a view of property in which the owner has rights to exclude others
In the sphere of science such rights of exclusion place limits on the communication of information and theories which are incompatible with the growth of knowledge
Thus for example the most obvious defect of the competitive nature of cossist algebra is the kind of secrecy exhibited by Tartaglia and Ferro which inhibited the spread of the results to other scholars in a position to contribute to their development
It is partially for this reason that Tartaglia s response to Cardano appears unreasonable to moderns who are sympathetic to a norm in which theories are published and thereby become public property
The development of scientific knowledge depends upon the publication that science tends to grow when communication is open
Rather there is a necessary connection between publication and the growth of knowledge
A necessary condition for the acceptability of a theory or experimental result is that it pass the public critical scrutiny of competent scientific judges A private theory or result is one that is shielded from the criteria of scientific acceptability
Since the judgment of competent peers is a necessary condition for the acceptability of a scientific result the publication of scientific work for the judgment of the scientific community is a necessary condition for its being a contribution to the growth of knowledge at all
Open communication for this reason is an essential condition for the scientific enterprise
This is not to say that secrecy or nondisclosure of results are absent from the scientific community
Individuals and research teams do not keep rivals informed at each stage of their progress
Science is a competitive enterprise
However the pressure for nondisclosure in science is for nondisclosure of premature work
It remains an essential condition for in the public domain
Competition in science is competition between individuals and groups to be first to place before the community a result which will be able to withstnd the critical scrutiny of competent judges
Where such an appraisal is successful one can claim rights to appropriate recognition
The defender of the market as an institution appropriate for science might respond at this point that my argument fails to note a way in which the market itself can provide a public test for conjectures which is quite akin to that in science
Consider the following parallel between the scientific community and the marketplace drawn by Loasby
After noting the point that I have just made that in science we have to rely on intersubjective criteria for appraising theories he writes
That should not be a disturbing proposition to economists used to invoking intersubjective judgements of value in the market resulting from the appraisals and decisions of competent wellinformed economic agents
The parallel goes further
Scientists seek to advance knowledge but can do so their fellows and to comparison with other new ideas from other scientists just as entrepreneurs seeking to better existing offerings must expose themselves to the appraisal of customer and suppliers and to the risk of being surpassed by competitors offers 
Loasby here is only pointing to parallels between scientific and market competition he is not suggesting that the market is an appropriate institutional framework for science
But it is open to the defender of the market in science to exploit the parallels
What would be wrong with using the market itself as a public test of the acceptability of theories Theories and results that failed to pass the appraisals and decisions of wellinformed competent economic agents would fail as they do when subject to the scrutiny of the scientific community
In a free market in knowledge good ideas force out bad
This defense of the appropriateness of a market framework for science can not be sustained
The market provides the wrong kind of public test of scientific knowledge
It does so the market provides the wrong kind of community of evaluators for theories
By this I mean something more than that the community of evaluators would include others apart from scientists
There is something wrong with the very parallels that Loasby draws between science and the market for Loasby as the value of a scientific theory is determined by judgments of competent wellinformed scientists so value in the marketplace is determined by the judgments of competent wellinformed economic agents
However the appeal to competent wellinformed economic agents is disingenuous
The market is in one sense an egalitarian institution any individual s preference counts in determining the market value of a good provided it is backed with cash
Any particular properties of an individual s personal skills capacities and competences are irrelevant to whether his or her judgment counts
The only property that counts is their capacity to pay
Informed and uninformed judgments all count equally
Market value is not determined by the appraisals but by the appraisals and decisions of economic agents per se incompetent as well as competent uninformed as well as informed
Science in contrast is inegalitarian in this sense
Only certain judgments count
The appraisal of the value of scientific work does require competent and informed judges
The judgments of those without the requisite competence are irrelevant
The market does not provide the right kind of community of evaluators for scientific work 
Neither does the market provide the right kind of criteria for evaluation of scientific work
The value a theory has to the development of scientific knowledge is not appropriately related to its market value
The market value of information and theories is instrumental it is a measure of their immediate usefulness in the service of commerce technology or even as is the case in the cossist tradition in gaining publicity for one s marketable skills through victory in competitions
Such usefulness is only contingently related to the significance of a theory to the internal development of the sciences for which simplicity and the like are the appropriate criteria of judgment
Relatedly markets will value theories that have immediate to nearfuture implications theories and information of more significance to the internal development of science have implications over a longer time scale
It is such reasons that are at the basis of the observation that markets favor research with immediate application and disfavor research of a more fundamental kind
This last point raises the second objection to the market as an institution appropriate to science given the employment of market mechanisms the value of a contribution to the development of science is disassociated from the external rewards that the institutions that support science assign to the contributor
Because the market value of information and theories is instrumental and is at best only indirectly related to the significance a theory has to the internal development of science its rewards to the contributor to science are not properly related to the significance of the contribution
In contrast the processes of assigning recognition developed by professional science such as peer review are not perfect are at least of the right kind to ensure that the contribution to the internal development of science is matched by external rewards appropriate recognition and its related benefits
This problem can be stated usefully in terms of Alasclair MacIntyre s distinction between practices and institutions The practice of science is characterized in terms of its internal goods ie those goods which can not be identified without reference to the kind of activity it is
The institutions of science are concerned with the distribution of external goods ie goods such as material wealth power and recognition which can be identified independently of any particular activity
In thesystem of property
in science that has emerged over the last three centuries the institutions of science are of the right kind to support the practice of science whereas the system of property distribution associated with the market is not
This distinction of MacIntyre s between internal and external goods raises a third possible objection to the introduction of market mechanisms and its related property science is incompatible as such with a commitment to the internal goods of science
The exclusivity of property rights of market goods is incompatible with a commitment to such internal goods to exclude other individuals from the use of a theory who are committed and able to contribute to the further development of a practice is thereby to indicate a failure of commitment to the development of the practice itself
Thus Ferro and Tartaglia in keeping secret their algorithm reveal by their behavior that the goals of the development of algebra are subordinate to goals of an exclusively competitive kind The communism of science highlighted by Merton is a particular case of a communism implicit in all wellordered human practices
The use of property relations of the marketplace in science is incompatible with a commitment to the internal goods of science
Theories and information are not the kinds of items to which exclusive property rights are appropriate given a view of science as an autonomous practice with its own internal goods
Hence to bring the market into
However this objection as it stands is open to the following rejoinder
The argument above confuses an individual having the right to exclude others from a theory with an individual s exercise of that right
While it is the case that an individual s excluding others from a contribution to science does show a failure in his or her commitment to that practice the use of the system of private property involved in the market is in itself neutral
It is open to the individual to exhibit his or her commitment to the practice of science by waiving the exercise of the rights of exclusion
This response is I believe a strong one although within a market economy each individual is forced to exercise at least some of his or her rights of exclusion
Let us concede that the third objection fails as stated
However its central point can be restated thus given an introduction of market property relations into science the act of publishing without some form of payment individual who so acts becomes the selfsacrificing giftgiving altruist found in Hagstrom s idealized model of the scientific community
What the market will have effected is an institutional redefinition of an individual s selfinterests which narrows its range
Whereas in existing scientific institutions to publish one s results is to act in a selfinterested way the market redefines this as an act against one s own interests
Hence given that the scientific community is not a community of rationalist saints the market undermines a commitment to the internal goals of science
The main point here is an Aristotelian one For Aristotle the correct response to the egoist who asks questions such as Why have friends or Why act virtuously is that the egoist has a narrow conception of what his or her goods are
The egoist assumes a narrow range of goods the biggest share of money honors and bodily pleasures and asks how friends or virtues bring these goods
One should respond not by trying to show friendship and virtue but by pointing out that the egoist has misidentified what the goods of life are This basic Aristotelian point however needs a sociologial dimension for it is the institutions themselves that define what counts as one s interests In particular the market encourages egoism not primarily because it encourages an individual to be selfinterested it would be unrealistic not to expect individuals to act for the greater part in a selfinterested manner but rather because it defines an individual s interests in a particularly narrow fashion most notably in terms of the possession of certain material goods
In consequence where market mechanisms enter a particularsphere of life the pursuit of goods outside this narrow range of market goods is institutionally defined as an act of altruism
For this reason the market undermines the pursuit of the internal goods of practices like those of science

A favorite topic in academic political philosophy in the last third of the twentieth century has been the shortcomings of the economic system under which most of us live
Though in recent years there has been some recognition of the advantages of the market and the difficulties with alternative economic systems this has not slowed the steady stream of criticism of this or that aspect of the free enterprise system
The purpose of this essay is to give an account of the geography of various criticisms of this system and to argue that most of those in the current philosophical literature suffer from a common drawback or defect of real importance
Toward the end of this essay I shall offer some positive suggestions about how critics might repair this defect
First an analytical question
What is meant by the term the free enterprise system This term is systematically ambiguous
We can think of it as describing actually existing economic systems or as describing some kind of ideal type that realworld economic systems only approximate
includes the economic systems of Western Europe North America and parts of the Pacific Rim
In these systems though there are state monopolies in certain industries eg education utilities communications and the state tries to influence the economy in various ways most production does not take place in stateowned firms and the state does not undertake or otherwise direct most new investment
In this sense a free enterprise system is any system in which most of the means of production are privately owned and the state does not determine most investment
On the other hand the term free enterprise system is sometimes used to refer to something more abstract
Theoretical discussions by critics and defenders of the free enterprise system often seem to be about the economic system of a hypothetical libertarian society with a nightwatchman state
In such a system all means of production are privately owned and there is no attempt at state direction of the economy
The state s role is strictly limited to enforcing no need to resolve this ambiguity about the term free enterprise system for the purposes of this essay
However this term is understood systematic criticisms of the free enterprise system are either explicitly or implicitly criticisms of the privateproperty rights that constitute the framework of that system
These rights can be understood as the positive legal rights that constitute actually existing economic systems but only insofar as these rights resemble those that would be found in the hypothetical libertarian society alluded to above
Let us begin with a taxonomy of these criticisms
The main function of any economic system is to produce and distribute exchangeable goods and services
One important kind of complaint against the free enterprise system is that it does not do a very good job at this that is the system is inherently dysfunctional with respect to some range of goods or services
The basic idea behind criticisms of this sort is that the system is not producing or distributing the relevant goods or services as efficiently as it could be
These Efficiency come from a variety of sources
Welfare economists often charge the freeenterprise system with market failures
Market failures are defects of the free enterprise system associated with externalities or public goods
Externalitites are positive or negative effects of voluntary transactions on noncontracting third parties
The benefits from a vaccination program and the harms associated with industrial pollution are often cited as examples of positive and negative externalities respectively
The usual charge is that the free enterprise system overproduces goods associated with negative externalities and underproduces goods associated with positive externalities
For example production of a consumer good that pollutes the atmosphere is at a higher level than it would be if the manufacturer or the consumer had to compensate those who suffer from the pollution
Overproduction in this case is overproduction relative to what would take place in an ideal market system
Similarly for underproduction of goods associated with positive externalities
An ideal market system is defined in terms of some very strong assumptions about perfect information welldefined property rights no monopoly there are no uncompensated externalities in this model of an economy
In orthodox welfare economics an ideal market system serves as a kind of benchmark against which realworld systems are judged
The reason for this is that it is a theorem of welfare economics that an ideal market system achieves a Pareto optimal allocation of resources producer and consumer goods this is a distribution in which no one can be made better off without someone else being made worse off
The main policy implication of this theorem according to orthodox thinking anyway is that realworld economic systems should be made more like an ideal market system to the extent that this feasible since this would result in distribution of goods and services more closely approximating Pareto optimality
For example if the state prohibits pollution above a certain level this directly or indirectly lowers production of the good in question this lower production is closer to the level of production that would occur in an ideal market system
This means that production is has achieved Pareto optimality
For this reason a change in the system of property rights that results in movement toward a Pareto optimal allocation of goods and services is thought to represent an efficiency gain for the system
A similar strategy is employed with public goods problems
Public goods are defined in terms of nonexcludability or jointness of supply and nonrivalrous consumption
In other words a public good is something nonpayers can not be feasibly excluded from consuming and consumption by one person does not diminish the quantity of the good available to others
Commonly cited examples of public goods include lighthouses and national defense
It is claimed that public goods like goods associated with positive externalities tend to be underproduced in a free enterprise system because roughly of excludability problems
As in the case of negative externalitites the solution to public goods problems is sought in governmental action
The state provides the good in question and forces everyone to contribute in virtue of the fact that the good is paid in theory free enterprise systems are inherently dysfunctional insofar as they suffer market failure that is problems associated with negative and positive externalities and public goods problems
These failures are explained by reference to the system of property rights in the means of production characteristic of the free enterprise system
In the real world however market failures are mitigated by governmental action which is as it should be according to these critics of the free enterprise system
The state provides some public goods such as national defense and it reduces negative externalities by for example regulating pollution
Nevertheless some negative externalities remain and not all public goods problems are solved
But perfection is not to be expected
Amelioration is however and that is what governmental action is supposed to deliver
Charges of market failure constitute one important type of Efficiency Criticism of the free enterprise system
Two other types of Efficiency Criticisms are worth mentioning
One concerns inefficiencies associated with monopolistic of oligopolistic pricing
The charge is prices are higher and production levels are lower than they would be in an ideal market system which by definition has many suppliers or producers for any given product perfect competition
This market imperfection is supposed to be cured by antitrust policy or by direct governmental regulation of prices or both
The cure may not be complete but it is better than the disease at least according to these critics of the free enterprise system
A final type of Efficiency Criticism is that the free enterprise system has certain inherent macrolevel instabilities which are made manifest in the business cycle
Keynesians for example maintain that the free enterprise system can and has suffered persistent and chronic unemployment of human resources because of insufficient aggregate demand
As in the case of other Efficiency Criticisms state action eg through fiscal or monetary policy is advocated to correct these perceived defects of the free enterprise system
These Efficiency Criticisms have provided a theoretical justification for much if not most century
What all these criticisms have in common is a charge that the free enterprise system a system of private property rights in the means of production is inherently dysfunctional in one way or another
The remedy for the problems thus identified is always state action
State action can take the form of a government program which is supposed to deal with the problem at hand or it can involve a more direct truncation or abrogation of private property rights or both
The thinking is that if government can change the rules of the free enterprise system or otherwise intervene so that the system s distribution of goods and services more closely approximates Pareto optimality it should do so
After all it is the rational thing to do on the collective level
Of course some of this justification for state intervention is after the fact
Antitrust legislation for example did not await midtwentieth century developments in welfare economics
Nevertheless much government regulation and intervention in the free enterprise system has been advocated the system has some inherently dysfunctional features which can be corrected or ameliorated by governmental action that in some way restricts private property rights
Radical criticism of the free enterprise system has for the most part followed the same general line
According to radical criticism the free enterprise system the capitalist system is severely dysfunctional
It is so inept at doing what any economic system is supposed to do namely meet people s wants and needs for exchangeable goods and services that it ought to be fundamentally altered
The language of crisis pervades radical criticism a language that seems more or less plausible at different times
Radicals and moderates differ in their respective judgments about the seriousness of the problem in question and about the appropriateness of different responses
Moderates believe that the inefficiencies of the free enterprise system are significant but not catastrophic they further maintain that institutional tinkering can noticeably improve efficiency
By contrast radicals are inclined to believe that the situation is so bad that only major institutional surgery can suggestions about who the surgeons should be
The literature detailing all of these Efficiency Criticism has not gone unchallenged Commonly voiced objections to the criticisms pertaining to public goods and externalities include the following the socalled public goods in question are not really public goods that is they can be privatized by redefining or simply enforcing property rights the provision of public goods can be tied to private goods which are excludable externalities can be internalized by a proper redefinition of private property rights or even the enforcement of already existing rights
Implicitly or explicitly these criticisms make the point that the unfettered market is more resourceful and more efficient that its critics believe
In a similar vein Efficiency Criticisms about monopolistic pricing and the instabilities of the business cycle have been challenged by Austrian and neoAustrian economists who argue that state intervention not market forces are primarily responsible for both of these problems Left to its own devices the free enterprise system would not face problems of monopoly pricing not to the extent that it does when the government intervenes
What all these objections to the criticisms outlined above have in common is the idea that the free enterprise system can meet the challenge the critic poses without the government restricting or abrogating private property rights
To the extent that these arguments succeed they show that the free enterprise system is not inherently dysfunctional in the way that critics charge
Only the most rigid and uncompromising defenders of the free enterprise system deny the justice of any and all of the Efficiency Criticisms that have been leveled over the past century or so
However a different kind of response to these criticisms has emerged over the past twentyfive years in the writings of the socalled PublicChoice school among others Central to their countercritique is the idea that the critic can not simply assume that governments or more exactly government officials have as their sole or even primary aim the promotion of the public good when they intervene in the economy
Critics of the free enterprise system government intervene to correct for some market failure
In a more positive vein these thinkers argue that the same assumptions and techniques used by standard economics to analyze and understand decisionmaking in the private sphere can be used to analyze and understand decisionmaking in the public sphere and that the application of these methods does not support the critics prescriptions about what ought to be done
This means that market inefficiencies do not necessarily get corrected indeed they can get worse when the solution to some Efficiency Criticism is sought in governmental action and the restriction of private property rights this entails
Put another way this extension of standard techniques of economic analysis into the public sphere has resulted in the discovery that public ie governmental decisionmaking has inefficiencies peculiar to itself
In short there is government failure as well as market failure
All this implies that it is not enough to show that the market fails in some way or other and that in theory the state could correct show that public institutions or decisionmaking through public institutions would produce a better result from the point of view of efficiency than would the market and the private property rights that constitute it
Absent an account of alternatives and how they would bring about the desired result Efficiency Criticisms of the free enterprise system remain incomplete and suggestive at best and misleading academic exercises at worst
They are incomplete without an adequate account of alternatives and how such alternatives would work they are misleading academic exercises to the extent that they lead people including people with political power to believe there are governmental solutions to what may be effectively unsolvable problems
For the purposes of this essay the most important feature of the Public Choice countercritique as well as the other objections mentioned above is that they all focus the issue between the defender and the critic of the free enterprise system so clearly Which set of institutional arrangements best achieves a certain agreedupon goal eg avoiding or reducing unemployment providing public goods with externalities or monopoly Indeed it is not necessary to accept all of Austrian economics or Public Choice Theory to recognize that the real issue on these efficiency questions is a choice of which alternative institutional arrangements can best solve a given problem
This issue reduces to the question of how property rights ought to be distributed across private and public actors to best achieve a certain result
Despite the award of the Nobel Prize for Economics in to James Buchanan one of the founders of the Public Choice movement it is hard to say how widely this insight has been recognized among economists
Much of economics in general and welfare economics in particular continues to consist in abstract mathematical modelbuilding and theoremproving There is correspondingly little attention paid to the really difficult question of what any of this tells us about how realworld economic systems ought to be structured
Although most mathematically inclined welfare economists have been reluctant to move precipitously or even at all from the identification of a certain defect to particular recommendations about how to correct the problem this has not prevented their work from being appropriated by those who do have a political agenda to advance
In addition economists who say Yes there is a real problem here but there may be nothing that government officials can do that would nt make matters worse tend not to get consulting contracts or high visibility
Economists criticisms of the free enterprise system can almost always be conceived of as Efficiency Criticisms of one sort or another
In evaluating economic systems economists generally take ends as given and debate the issue of means
The reasons for this are various
Sometimes they seem to believe that questions about ends can not be rationally debated or less charitably they have not been taught how to carry on such debates
Sometimes they appeal to democratic and individualistic ideals according to which each individual s values are as important as any other s
On this way of thinking the only question worth debating means for achieving already given ends
By contrast philosophical criticism of the free enterprise system tends to go beyond or behind this meansends nexus
This type of criticism often starts with some intuitive value judgment or moral judgment unfavorable to life in contemporary society
The objectionable state of affairs is traced to the free enterprise system or more exactly the private property rights that define that system
A common type of criticism concerns the scope of market exchange
The basic idea is that while the market may be a perfectly acceptable institutional framework for producing and distributing some goods and services there are others that are currently produced and distributed in this way for which it is not
For example it has been argued that housing and workplace health and safety are not properly speaking commodities A similar view about human organs is widespread in the medical ethics community
The general idea is that there is something about the character of each of these things that makes it inappropriate for any of them to by the market or by marketlike mechanisms
That is there is something inappropriate about people having private property rights in these things in the same way they do with other owned objects
The criticism is not that the market inefficiently produces or distributes these things instead the charge is that there is something inherently objectionable about a system that produces or distributes these goods or services in this manner
For example if a destitute Filipino is willing to sell one of her kidneys to a rich American the problem with an economic system that permits this sale is not according to this way of thinking that the market in human organs is too thin for robust bargaining to take place or even that the market is an inefficient way
to allocate transplantable organs
Rather the charge is that there is something objectionable about the very fact or is it the very idea of people selling their own body parts
Because these criticisms are directed at the scope of the free enterprise
The main function of the free enterprise system indeed of any economic system is to meet people s wants and needs for exchangeable goods and services
Economists Efficiency Criticisms criticize how well the free enterprise system does this job whereas philosophers Scope Criticisms focus on how extensive that job ought to be
However there is another type of criticism coming from philosophers that does not easily fit either of these categories
Some criticisms are directed not at the free enterprise system qua economic system but instead at some side effects of its operation
The free enterprise system can permit and even require allegedly objectionable things to happen that are not directly related to this main function
For example egalitarians charge that the free enterprise system permits and indeed promotes morally unacceptable inequalities in wealth and income
Civil rights advocates charge that the free enterprise system has permitted morally objectionable racial discrimination and segregation in housing
The purpose of the economic system is not to generate income inequalities or segregated housing a foreseeable side effect of the system s operation
Accordingly let us call criticisms such as these SideEffect Criticisms
Although philosophers who offer Scope and SideEffect criticisms of the free enterprise system sometimes do not conceive of themselves as criticizing the economic system per se their criticisms can be conceived of in this way because they are directed at the property rights that define that system
Private property rights permit and indeed encourage the objectionable things to happen
Philosophers who offer these criticisms conceive their central task to be the theoretical justification of the intuition that there is something objectionable about the current state of affairs
Why should occupational risks not be distributed by the market What is wrong with significant in equalities in wealth and income Why is the lack of equal opportunity an injustice The theoretical justification for the relevant moral judgments usually consists of the articulation of part of a moral or political theory which includes some general principles that imply the intuition
If this is well done it the author and those who share the author s intuitions
It is an interesting question which can not be pursued here whether this procedure merely systematizes the prejudices of the author and those who share her sentiments or whether there is something more objective taking place
That potential difficulty to one side what I now want to suggest is that many if not most Scope and SideEffect Criticisms of the free enterprise system face the same problems that have plagued economists Efficiency Criticisms
The critics have either failed to specify their preferred alternative to private property rights or to the extent that they have specified an alternative they have failed to explain how it will solve the problem they have called attention to without resulting in something equally bad or worse
Let us consider Scope Criticisms first
Often those who offer such criticisms of the free enterprise system do not have much to say about how the goods or services in question ought to be produced or distributed except that market mechanisms are ruled on costbenefit analysis as a basis for decisionmaking about worker health and safety Elizabeth Anderson devotes nearly her entire article to the reasons why markets or mechanisms that mimic the market should not beused in this area
The discussion of alternatives by contrast is limited to less than a half a paragraph of vague remarks about the advantages of participatory institutions 
Other Scope Criticisms offer specific advice about what ought to be done but fall to consider systematic unintended negative consequences that may result from attempts to institute their proposal
For example in a recent article in Philosophy and Public Affairs Margaret Jane Radin argues that private property rights in rental housing ought to be significantly restricted by rent control on the grounds that housing ought not to be treated as a mere commodity
Despite the detailed blueprint for rent control legislation she draws up nowhere in her article does she consider the possibility that the people who frame and interpret this legislation will not be most interested in doing what Radin believes is right from the interests of the intended beneficiaries
This is important in light of the fact that in numerous cities where rent control has been implemented welloff and articulate tenants have benefited significantly from rent control policies which have not only ruined many landlords but also harmed poor and inarticulate tenants As Marxists like to say This is no accident
""
The same problems that face Scope Criticisms also face SideEffect Criticisms
The first kind of difficulty the failure to articulate genuine alternatives is most evident in cases where the criticism of the free enterprise system is indirect
For example Ronald Dworkin offers a qualified defense of equality of economic resources as a political ideal Naturally this equality is not realized or even approximated by the free enterprise system
Implementing this idea requires a political authority to equalize differences due to natural endowments by compensating those with disabilities and imposing a progressive income tax on those with exceptional natural talents
To carry this equalization out political authorities need a market to determine the As Alexander Rosenberg has pointed out however the kind of market Dworkin envisions could never exist in reality since it assumes away crucial problems imperfect information time constraints etc realworld market systems have to confront It might be responded that Dworkin s ideal market is an analytical device intended to help us think through what equality of resources amounts to as such it is not intended to describe an actually existing institution
But this response concedes the very point at issue namely that Dworkin has failed to describe an alternative to currently existing institutions
Some SideEffect Criticisms of the free enterprise system do specify alternative institutional arrangements but fail to explain how the new rules will solve the problem the critic has identified without resulting in something equally bad or worse
A telling example can be found in John Rawls s discussion in A Theory of Justice of the implementation of his principles of distributive justice
Rawls envisions a re distribution branch of government in a market society with private is to preserve an approximate justice in distributive shares by means of taxation and the necessary adjustments in the rights of property The purpose of these levies and regulations is not to raise revenue release resources to government but gradually and continually to correct t he distribution of wealth and to prevent concentrations of power One need not be a Marxist to believe that the State often represents someone s interests other than the public interest or even more implausibly the interests of justice
It is rather naive of Rawls to suppose that political authorities could find no use for the vast power required to implement this substantial redistribution of wealth and income other than insuring distributive justice
Casual empiricism concerning the behavior actually existing states suggests that once the state has the power to finetune the distribution of wealth and income the chances that a society s actual distribution of wealth and income will even approximate the demands of justice whatever those demands might be are remote at best
Throughout this section and indeed throughout the book rather complicated ideals to determine the workings of the political system
There seems therefore to be a general problem about alternatives facing philosophers Scope and SideEffect Criticisms of the free enterprise system
Philosophers like economists have not thought through alternatives to the economic system they are criticizing
Can anything be said on their behalf To investigate this question let us consider how the philosophercritic might try to defend himself
The most obvious excuse is to appeal to the division of labor
One can not do everything and the philosopher is best suited to establishing or exposing systemic defects of contemporary social institutions it might be modestly admitted that philosophers do not have the relevant empirical background knowledge or expertise to spell out the alternatives
In addition it might be argued that new institutions have to come about through concerted political action which requires a correct reading of the current political situation the philosopher has no special expertise about that
On a more positive note it might be argued that the the normarive or ethical evaluation of existing institutions
There are some suggestive parallels on this score in ethical theory and epistemology that make this position look attractive and defensible
Ethical theorists and epistemologists who have reflected long on the relation between theory and practice in their subject matter might well come to something like the following general conclusion Human beings are a pretty sorry bunch in their personal and cognitive behavior
There is no hope of reforming them of getting them to clean up their act
Any serious attempt to do so will either be irrelevant or make matters worse
The task of the theorist is simply to evaluate and explain their practices in accordance with the appropriate intellectual standards
So the ethical theorist might say that he is only interested in evaluating human actions andor character it is fanciful to believe that ethical theory can or should result in less immorality in the world
In a similar manner an epistemologist might maintain that his only aim or purpose is to evaluate human cognitive activity The idea that among the results of his epistemological investigations could be a general improvement in cognitive hygiene is as fanciful as the belief that the practice of ethical theorizing could reduce the severity or incidence of sin
By analogy it is enough for the political philosopher to identify in a systematic way the defects of existing institutions including the free enterprise system
Proposing alternatives need not be part of that critique
If he can propose a feasible or realizable alternative more power to him but there is nothing in his enterprise qua political philosophy that requires any account of alternatives
It may well be that there is no internal inconsistency in this position as it applies to political philosophy or for that matter as it pertains to ethics or epistemology
The problem is that even if this is a consistent position it is incompatible with what critics of the free enterprise system evidently beleive they are doing
These critics seem to conceive of their task as providing reasons for social change institutional rules especially property rights
This is true even of relatively abstract theories of justice such as what one finds in the writings of Rawls and Dworkin
These theories very often clearly imply that the free enterprise system has certain defects defects that warrant or justify institutional change
We know that institutional change is not a completely rational process in the sense that social change closely tracks the best arguments of the day but no social thinker believes himself or herself to be so remote from the levers of social change that his or her writings could not have an impact on the shape of social institutions
Perhaps more importantly if the critic of the free enterprise system does not conceive of his task as at least in part providing reasons for social change he is leaving open the possibility that genuinely beneficial change in the economic system in some particular respect might well be impossible
This possibility reflects a pessimism or conservatism that few critics of the free enterprise system seem to endorse
Moreover a serious possibility intellectual honesty would require that one call attention to it
Since critics of the free enterprise system have not called attention to this possibility without exception as far as I can tell and are we shall presume intellectually honest they must believe that there are potentially feasible alternatives to the way things are currently done
For these reasons failure to specify alternatives is not a live option for philosophercritics of the free enterprise system
To the extent that these critics have failed to specify alternative institutional arrangements or explain how the latter would solve or ameliorate the problems they have called attention to without causing something comparably bad to happen they have failed to come to grips with the conservative point of view
This will come as no surprise to partisans of this perspective
The general conservative line is to admit that existing social institutions are plagued with a variety of defects and problems of varying seriousness but that nothing much can be done about them without making matters worse more detail since it represents a kind of standing threat to social criticism as it is currently practiced by philosophers a threat to which most contemporary political philosophers have been oblivious
When the institution being criticized is the free enterprise system there are basically two possible conservative responses One denies that the free market or the private property rights that define it is responsible for the problem instead the government is to blame or perhaps the problem lies in human nature
A second response grants that the system has the problem to which the critic has called attention but denies that any effort should be made to do anything about it at least at the institutional level In particular state action restricting or abrogating private property rights either will not solve the problem or will create some systematic unintended consequences that are at least as bad as the original problem
Notice the parallels between these conservative responses to philosophers criticisms and the two critiques of economists Efficiency Criticisms discussed earlier in this paper absolve the free enterprise system of the charges the critic has lodged against it by blaming something else
On the other hand conservatives are sometimes willing to concede usually sotto voce the critic s complaints against the free enterprise system but like the Public Choice theorists they object to the idea that state restriction or abrogation of private property rights is the best or even a good response to the problem
The conservative position on any of these questions may not be the correct one but this is something that philosophercritics of the free enterprise system must show
What exactly does this entail What must the critic of the free enterprise system do to defeat the conservative challenge that doing nothing is the best counsel It is important that the argument of this paper not face the selfreferential paradox of failing to provide positive suggestions about how critics should proceed At one level the answer is fairly obvious the critic must specify alternative institutional arrangements and explain how these arrangements will solve or ameliorate us consider in some detail what each of these requirements amounts to
Because Scope and SideEffect Criticisms of the free enterprise system are directed at a system of private property rights in the means of production the proposed alternative will involve systematic changes in those rights
Those changes have to be spelled out
Since any system of property rights is a system of permissions and prohibitions on certain activities associated with whatever is owned a proposal for change in property rights is a proposal for a change in this system of permissions and prohibitions
When private property rights are under critical scrutiny this proposed change usually takes the form of private individuals or groups being required to or forbidden from doing something that had previously been merely permitted
For example it might be proposed that businesses should be required to maintain certain health or safety standards that had previously not been required
Or it might be proposed that employers are to be forbidden to fire employees at will and must instead show just cause and respect arrangements includes a new or expanded government program as well as a restriction of private property rights
In the case of Scope Criticisms there might be a proposal for a government program to deal with the wants and needs that elicited a market response in the first place
Implicit in some SideEffect Criticisms eg some criticisms of the distributive justice of the free enterprise system are rather extensive government programs to correct the problems allegedly caused by the operation of the free enterprise system
Finally implicit in many radical SideEffect Criticisms as well as radical Efficiency Criticisms are proposals for an entirely different economic system usually a socialist one
This system has to be defined in terms of the property rights it envisions
Just as the critic must articulate the changes in property rights he or she has in mind and the associated government program if any it is also necessary to argue that these changes will in fact have the desired effect
One thing this means is that it is result
Politicians often entitle their legislation in terms of the hopedfor result eg the Paperwork Reduction Act social critics must avoid this way of thinking
It will always be a contingent question whether the envisioned institutional changes will do what they are intended to do
To illustrate these requirements more concretely let us consider two criticisms of the free enterprise system one of which adequately addresses them and one of which does not
Up until the mids the economic system of the United States in virtue of laws recognizing and enforcing private property rights permitted owners of public accommodations to refuse service to anyone for whatever reason
Owners of many businesses in the South and elsewhere refused to serve black people or segregated their facilities based on this right
Many people came to believe that the law respecting unrestricted private property rights in public accommodations was unjust in this instance
This is a SideEffect Criticism of the economic system
Passage of the Civil Rights Act of curtailed private property rights in public identifiable injustice and it will come out that way on just about any theory of justice
Obviously after the fact it is easy enough to specify the alternative but even before the fact it was not difficult to spell out the proposed institutional changes
The envisioned changes were narrow and relatively welldefined no more segregated lunch counters Colored Only drinking fountains rest rooms etc
""
The government was not telling businessmen how to run their businesses they were only saying However you run your business do not discriminate on the basis of race
In short what was required and what in the end was enacted was a law that prohibited racial discrimination in public accommodations
It was also possible to foresee that the law outlawing discrimination in public accommodations would for the most part be effective even if the exact extent and duration of resistance could not be foretold
It was reasonably clear what the prohibited behaviors were those whose rights were and by the midSixties the Federal government had the will and the means to enforce the law
In addition there were threats of private action eg boycotts in cases of noncompliance
All of these factors came together to make it rational for most owners of public accommodations to comply with the law whatever their personal feelings
One final factor that explains the success of this change in property rights is that businessmen are about the most easily intimidated group in contemporary society which is why they are often called upon to lead the way in matters of social change
As a result black people in the US today do not suffer the systematic indignities visited on them in the past when they were routinely denied equal access to public accommodations
Some conservatives who opposed the Civil Rights Act did so on the grounds that there is nothing morally objectionable about segregation and discrimination
That is they did not see a problem that needed solving
At best this manifests a certain sort of insensitivity conservative concern was that this act would set a bad precedent
It would give federal government increased power at the expense of state and local governments and it would set the stage for more pervasive governmental interference in the future
Here the concern is with unintended negative consequences of a proposed change
The proponent of change can grant that these are legitimate worries but still maintain that the change ought to be instituted on the grounds that the benefits in terms of utility justice or whatever outweigh the risks
Moreover even if these conservatives worst fears have come to pass it is surely an oversimplification to attribute the resultant problems to antidiscrimination statutes
These concerns to one side however the main point of this discussion is that this is a case in which the free enterprise system can be and indeed was criticized in such a way that the demand for a specification of an alternative could be met
Let us consider now a case where a criticism of for an alternative
In Elizabeth Anderson s survey article referred to above Values Risks and Market Norms the author nicely articulates a number of reasons why it is objectionable to allow issues of worker health and safety to be decided by the market or costbenefit analysis which is supposed to mimic the market
In answer to the question What ought to be done she says
The people who are placed at risk should have the opportunity to participle directly in the decisions which affect them
They should have the power to propose debate and vote on alternative health and safety projects and to participate in the implementation of these projects
For example customers of and residents put at risk by a local power company could elect representatives to a committee joined by elected representatives of workers and stockholders in the firm which would be invested with the power to make health and safety decisions regarding the plant 
This passage is typical of discussions of alternatives that the free enterprise system
Although it looks as if the proposed change is described in terms of an institutional process it is in fact a description of a result namely widespread participation by those affected
Only in the third sentence is the reader given any idea about what institutional mechanism is supposed to insure this result
Moreover the proposed institutional change is so thinly described that it is not even clear that it is coherent
The main difficulty is that it envisions a transfer of some but not all management rights from the original owners to this new committee
Based on what Anderson says it appears that this committee is supposed to have the power to order expenditures institute programs and so forth
Assuming the managers retain other management rights this means that management rights are fragmented among different and independent groups
The problem is that it is not clear that such a pattern of rights could persist in anything but name only
Because this committee could significantly affect the profitability have a strong incentive to do everything it could to control it
It is not obvious how this could be prevented without transferring effective control of the means of production to this committtee or some third party eg the state
In defense of Anderson it might be pointed out that she explicitly recognizes in a footnote near the passage under discussion that she is not proposing an institutional framework her words as an alternative
Moreover she refers the reader to Chapter of James Campen s Benefit Cost and Beyond for a more elaborate discussion of alternatives
However this footnote is revealing in two respects
The very fact that she has relegated this crucial issue to a footnote indicates importance she attaches to the discussion of an alternative in a critique of the free enterprise system
Further in the work to which she refers the reader the author states that this participatory alternative requires the replacement of the free enterprise system with socialism
Campen says In the of BCA BenefitCost Analysis requires a democratic socialist society
 If Anderson endorses these sentiments in her critique of the free enterprise system in this article then she is really advocating some version of socialism in which case she should say so and defend its feasibility
Moreover the considerations adduced in the second previous paragraph support Campen s contention that socialism would be required
Under these circumstances it is disingenuous for Anderson to avoid mentioning the S word
Finally and most importantly in the absence of a defense of the feasibility of some alternative nothing Anderson says refutes the claim that despite its drawbacks the current system is the best way to deal with risks in the workplace
This problem is especially pressing in light of the fact that no existing socialist system deals with worker health and safety in anything remotely resembling the way she recommends
Feasibility in the above sense should not be confused with
political practicality
Judgments about what is politically practical are timesensitive are legitimately beyond the philosopher s purview
Perhaps more importantly the political practicality of a proposed change is really a question of the likelihood that the change can be made not the chances that the change if instituted will achieve the desired result
The upshot is that effective and intellectually responsible social criticism does not require a practical political blueprint for initiating social change
Maybe a better term to describe what is needed is realizability
What the critic must sketch is a realizable alternative
This requires not only the articulation of changes in the existing system of property rights but also some kind of argument or explanation for how these changes will produce the desired outcome without at the same time producing comparably bad systematic unintended consequences
What in general terms might such an argument or explanation look like
What is needed is some sort of plausible story about what people will do if and when private property rights are altered in specified ways
Such stories can be told at different levels of abstraction applies the formal techniques first developed in microeconomics to generate explanations and qualified predictions about what happens when governmental decisionmaking property rights supplants private decisionmaking property rights
However this is not the only way to think about what happens when changes in property rights are instituted
A more informal method involves simply asking what positive and negative incentives would be created by the proposed changes and how the affected people would respond to the changes
For example if the proposal is that the law should be changed to require or prohibit certain actions on the part of those who own or manage productive resources some reason has to be offered to persuade us to believe that the law can be efficiently enforced
One need not assume that those affected are especially venal in order to see the point of this
It is part of the nature of the situation that these people are not spontaneously doing what they are supposed to do
The whole idea is to use the force of law to get them not do
There has to be some reason to believe that they will actually do it and not succeed in taking evasive action
This potential problem may not be very serious when the envisioned change is a nottoodrastic restriction on the exercise of some ownership rights and a plausible story can be told about how it will be enforced eg the Civil Rights case sketched above
On the other hand the problem is potentially much more serious when the proposed change significantly disrupts previous ways of doing things and when there are additional positive and negative incentives for noncompliance
The imposition of affirmative action quotas in hiring and promotion comes to mind as an obvious case in point
The sort of storytelling described in the preceding paragraph assumes imperfect rationality and rather limited benevolence
Of course these assumptions are not universal truths about human nature but they do not have to be
They need only be roughly accurate descriptions of most of the affected people in the society under discussion
That point to an abstract picture of human nature which can then be manipulated more systematically
However it is not obvious that this would improve predictive power over what common sense can tell us
The whole idea of the approach advocated here is to use common sense to make some rough predictions about what ordinary people would do if proposed changes in property rights were to go into effect
What results from speculations of this sort will be lacking in analytical rigor and potentially contestable
However there is no reason in principle why such speculations should tell us less about what would happen in the real world than do highly abstract models of human behavior favored by many economists
Perhaps more importantly this way of thinking is perfectly suited to addressing conservative concerns about systematic unintended negative consequences of institutional change
The conservative says Ordinary people faced with the institutional changes you envision are going to frustrate your designs by doing or not doing X Y and Z The approach outlined above takes this challenge seriously Time and again philosophercritics of the free enterprise system have failed to do this This in part accounts for the air of unreality that surrounds much of contemporary political philosophy
What is at stake in all of this is of some general importance
There is a long history of critiques of modern institutions especially the free enterprise system that have not been accompanied by proposals for alternative institutional arrangements beyond the vaguest intellectual armwaving
The appearance of modesty involved in pleading ignorance about empirical matters may well belie an unwillingness to come to grips with the possibility that not all desirable change is really feasible not just for the moment but as far into the future as it makes sense to look
Until philosophercritics take seriously the problem of thinking through alternative institutional arrangements their critique of existing institutions will be incomplete and political philosophy will continue to be largely ignored by practical men and women who directly shape the structure of social institutions

In rats amphetamine produces stereotyped locomotion which is characterized by perseverative movement along a fixed route around the perimeter of an open field
The program described in this paper is designed to facilitate analysis of stereotyped locomotion by measuring the repetitive nature of trips between adjacent quadrants of the apparatus using a method described by Mueller Hollingsworth and Cross a which subdivides locomotion into a series of trip lengths
The program is written in Microsoft QuickBASIC to run on an IBM PCXT or compatible machine
Data from the program can be read by spreadsheets
The clinical effects of antipsychotic drugs are thought to involve dopamine receptor blockade in the brain
Injecting animals with amphetamine in order to increase dopamine transmission has proved to be a useful model of schizophrenia
For example antagonism of amphetamineinduced changes in open field behavior is a widely used screening technique in the search for compounds that could be used in the treatment of schizophrenia
This research is motivated by the need to develop new drug treatments which do not acute dystonia and tardive dyskinesias associated with some antipsychotic drugs
In the past most attention was focused on antagonism of amphetamineinduced stereotyped head and forelimb movements sniffing licking and gnawing because these behaviors are reduced by so called classic antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol
Paradoxically more recently developed atypical antipsychotics such as sulpiride have been found to increase some amphetamineinduced stereotyped behaviors Robertson MacDonald 
Atypical antipsychotics are potentially of great clinical significance because they have been found to produce fewer extrapyramidal side effects in patients
This asymmetry in the effects of classic and atypical antipsychotics in the animal test system led Robertson and MacDonald to cast doubt on the validity of antagonism of amphetamineinduced stereotyped behaviors as a test of antipsychotic potential
Recently Ljungberg and Ungerstedt have shown that both classic and atypical antipsychotics reduce the increase in locomotion produced by amphetamine
Traditionally the effects of amphetamine on locomotion and stereotypy have been considered separately but produce stereotyped locomotion which is characterized by perseverative movement along a fixed route around the periphery of the open field Schiorring 
There are several reasons why the study of stereotyped locomotion has been relatively neglected a the most popular technique for recording amphetamineinduced locomotion utilizes photobeam devices that do not record the spatiotemporal characteristics of movement b subtle variations in an animal s route are not easily detected by a human observer and c until recently statistical techniques which reflect the essential invariant and repetitive nature of stereotyped locomotion have not been available
A number of laboratories have addressed these problems
Geyer Russo Segal and Kuczenski linked a photobeam apparatus to a computer so that the stored sequence of beam breaks could be used to create diagrams showing the spatial pattern of locomotion around the apparatus
Kenyon described a lowcost system which uses a handheld mouse to trace the subject s path into a microcomputer for detailed analysis
The system allows the experimenter matrix of regions and provides a printout giving the temporal sequence of movement between these regions
The present paper describes a computer program STEREO which analyzes stereotypy in spatiotemporal patterns of locomotion
Although the term stereotyped has been used to label different behavioral manifestations of the amphetamineinduced syndrome Szechtman Eilam Teitelbaum Golani it is clear that stereotypy is measured most effectively in terms of criteria that reflect the repetition and invariance of particular responses evoked by the drug
Mueller Hollingsworth and Cross a described simple statistics which quantify the repetitive nature of trips between regions of equal size marked with lines on the floor of an open field
A single trip consists of a sequence of movements between adjacent regions and is terminated when the animal reverses direction or completes a tour of the perimeter
Trip length is defined as the number of regions entered lines crossed during a trip
Two successive trips of equal length are termed repeat trips a change trip is Hollingsworth and Cross a introduce a statistic Gamma which is defined as the number of repeat trips divided by the number of repeat trips plus change trips
Mueller Kunko Whiteside and Haskett b have shown that trip length varies as a function of amphetamine dose
We have found Mueller Hollingsworth and Cross s a approach to analyzing stereotyped locomotion useful but the classification of movements between regions into appropriate trip types from a list of regions entered is error prone and time consuming
For example if the floor of the open field is divided into four regions there are thirtysix possible combinations of region entries that need to be considered when assigning a trip to one of the four possible trip types
The program is designed to overcome these problems
STEREO assumes the floor of the open field has been divided into four regions labeled and and that a complete trip in a clockwise direction around the consist of the sequence 
This trip would be assigned a length of and classified as Trip Type 
The program written in Microsoft QuickBASIC reads the sequence of region entries from DATA statements which appear at the top of the program
This method of data input was chosen so that a word processor can be used to prepare data for analysis
The code is used to indicate the end of a trial
There is no limitation on the number of trials that can be analyzed by STEREO
The code FINISH is used to terminate processing data from an individual subject
The data from several subjects can be anlayzed sequentially
The code NOTENDOFDATA is used to indicate that data from another subject should be processed the code ENDOFDATA is used to terminate processing data from a group of subjects
The edited data file should be loaded into the program using QuickBASIC s File by STEREO
The printout presents a breakdown of the number of trip type for each trial together with the number of repeated trips of each type
A center trip is scored whenever the subject crosses between any of the regions of the open field that are diagonally opposite each other eg from Region to Region 
A center trip is classified as Trip Type 
The printout reports the actual sequence of trip types
Repeated trips of a particular length are presented on a single line of the printout the print head is reset to the start of the next line whenever there is a change in trip type
The printout contains details of the number of clockwise and anticlockwise trips around the perimeter of the open field and presents them in their sequence
A complete trip in a anticlockwise direction around the field starting and finishing in Region would consist of the sequence 
In addition to displaying results on screen STEREO also stores and gamma values for each subject in Comma Separated Value CSV files named TRIPn RTRIPn and GAMMA respectively
The value of n corresponds to the appropriate trip length for the stored data
These files can be read by spreadsheet programs such as SuperCalc
A copy of the source code for STEREO can be obtained by writing to the author enclosing a formatted disk and selfaddressed disk envelope
APPENDIX PREFORMATTED TABLE
Groups of American and Japanese managers completed a research questionnaire which was developed to collect judgments on the behaviors skills and other attributes of supervisors whose personal productivity is very high
Analysis of respondent data indicates that American and Japanese perceptions of personal productivity characteristics are positively correlated and overlap particularly in such skillbehavior areas as planning motivation communicating leadership efficient use of resources and decision making
Differences between the two groups with respect to certain style dimensions were also found
Japanese managers endorsed behaviors that were otheroriented and principleoriented
Examples of the latter deal with strategic and innovative viewpoints employee selection and performance monitoring
Typical American responses tended to focus on more instrumental notions of individual supervisory skills communication working with people knowledge of product belief in hisher own ability to succeed and decisionmaking technique
This paper reports the results of research investigating differences between American and Japanese managers in terms of their perceptions of skills behaviors and other attributes which relate to as part of a comprehensive study directed at identifying key managing skills
A number of managing skill dimensions have been postulated including planning and organizing decision making written communication group interaction leadership ethics and integrity
American industry today is being challenged to enhance organization and individual performance across several criteria of effectiveness including productivity and product or service quality
Accordingly it was decided to investigate the feasibility of developing a personal productivity dimension by identifying a number of skills behaviors and other attributes which characterize supervisors who are highly productive
This paper summarizes the key findings in that study focusing particularly on the perceptions of American and Japanese managers regarding personal productivity of supervisors
METHOD
For purposes of this study personal productivity is defined as the supervisor s ability to get lots of things done and done well in a time period
A Personal Productivity Research Questionnaire was constructed using items generated through a survey of managers supervisors and MBA students employed respondent was asked to think of a supervisor with whom heshe was familiar whose personal work productivity is very high in the top of all supervisors on this criterion
Based on this perspective the respondent was asked to list one or more characteristic of that supervisor citing behaviors skills traits or other attributes
A total of responses were obtained
Three members of the Business School faculty reviewed the responses sorted them into categories and generated reasonably distinct questionnaire items
The reduction was carried out to diminish the volume of items to be presented in a final survey form while preserving the wide variety of item topics suggested by survey respondents
The items selected finally covered a broad spectrum of attributes ranging from those typically appearing in management behavior checklists to such areas as work habits ethics speed reading personal financial planning etc
Participants completed the questionnaire by reading each of the behaviorskill attribute items and placing a check mark alongside those items which in their judgment again among the top of all supervisors on this dimension
Copies of the final Personal Productivity Research Questionnaire were completed by supervisors and managers employed in a variety of firms located in southeastern Michigan about twothirds of the sample were employed in auto and autorelated organizations
The instrument was also completed by a group of Japanese nationals who were working in a local steel fabricating firm
The Japanese subjects had been assigned by their parent firm in Japan to work as managers and technical specialists in a local joint venture organization
All were experienced supervisors or managers and fluent in English
RESULTS
Three contrasts between American and Japanese perceptions of supervisory Personal Productivity are outlined below a Overall responses b Areas of agreement and c Areas of disagreement
Overall Response Tendencies
In the first analysis performed it was found that American and Japanese subjects responded to the questionnaire items differently The American overall mean number of check marks ie endorsements was counterpart Japanese mean was about 
This difference in these item response frequencies is statistically significant beyond the level
Item variances were not significantly different
It was feared that a disparity between response distributions of this magnitude might complicate the interpretation of raw response data
Accordingly it was decided to convert each item s response percentage ie number of check marksnumber of subjects in the group to a Zscore centered on the group s overall percent response mean
In this manner items were scaled separately for the American and the Japanese manager groups and each item was scaled above or below the group mean in standard deviation units
Zscores reflect the group s relative assessment of items on a comparable scale of measurement
A complete listing of questionnaire items group response percents and Zscores is available on request from the author
Areas of Group Agreement
Pattern
A betweengroup product moment correlation coefficient was calculated at significant beyond indicating high overall agreement between the items to the personal productivity of supervisors
High ZScore Items
Items were rankordered in Zscore terms for each group
Within each group the items having the largest positive Zscores ie the most frequentlyendorsed items were selected for further analysis
The results are displayed in Tables and 
Six items are common to the two lists that is these items were perceived by both subject groups as highly characteristic of personally productive supervisors
Table displays these common items
Note that the content areas covered in these six items are among the fundamental management responsibilities and skills typically associated with basic management planning motivating communication leadership efficient use of resources and decision making
Thus both groups of subjects appear to agree that personal productivity of supervisors is related to skillful practice of basic management functions
There is also evidence that American and Japanese subjects hold different and sometimes opposing views on other aspects of high personal productivity
Table shows the seven Zscore items ie those on which their endorsements diverge markedly
In the listing of the seven items endorsed most frequently by each group of subjects but not endorsed by both groups it can be noted that Japanese subjects endorsed four types of behaviors Otheroriented employee supervisionmonitoring a strategic view of the job and innovation
Each of these dimensions is typically encompassed in the current literature dealing with Japanese emphasis on group harmony kaizen the attitude of constant improvement and principled management
The counterpart list of items ranking high among Americans covers quite different dimensions of management behavior and suggests an orientation to personal productivity which is more techniqueoriented instrumental and less themedriven
It should also be noted that the two groups displayed agreement on items which they both felt were not related to personally productive behavior such as Takes a loaded briefcase home every night is a speed reader has a personal financial plan
Low Zscore items may reflect study
Areas of Disagreement
Divergent ZScores
The item Zscores for each group of subjects were reviewed to identify those items for which Zscore differences between manager groups were large
The eight items listed in Table exhibit higher Zscore differences than other items
The greatest differences arise with respect to selfconfidence teamwork commitment planning quantitative skills and several employeerelated behaviors
In general American managers assess individual supervisory techniques more highly than do Japanese managers
The key areas of disagreement center on supervisory style Monitoring performance avoiding reprimands and discipline and proper selection placement of employees
Delegation is not considered to be an attribute of the Japanese style of management apparently in either the homeland or in US transplant operations while employee involvement and participation in broadscale decision making are generally endorsed in contemporary American management training programs
CONCLUSIONS
This research was carried out to assess differences between American and Japanese managers with respect to their perceptions of behaviors skills and other attributes which might contribute to supervisory personal across these cultures as a correlate of the several dimensions of supervisory skills which are considered basic to management jobs organizing and planning motivation communication leadership concern for efficiency and decision making
Contrasts between the perceptions of American and Japanese managers with respect to supervisory personal productivity are instructive
First it should be noted that there is a high level of agreement between the groups across all items in the personal productivity research questionnaire reflecting a rather broad range of agreement between American and Japanese perceptions
Analysis suggests that both groups of managers see basic management skills as correlates of personal productivity
Beyond this core agreement however the groups hold different views on matters of technique and principle
American managers take a somewhat more instrumental view of personal productivity focusing on techniques which are widely urged as desirable practicesorientations in modern business and industry many of these techniques relate to skills which are individual in nature
Quantitative skills are not seen as positively related to productivity a perception which may Crosby and modern production system philosophies
Further evidence of this instrumental orientation might be found in the American subjects tendency to endorse more items as related to personal productivity of supervisors than did Japanese subjects
Among Japanese managers however perceptions of personal productivity reflect an appreciation for teamwork innovation and principled personnel management
None of these ideas is new
Several years ago the President of Nippon Steel commented on the difference between American and Japanese management suggesting that while the US corporation is regarded as a cold impersonal entity the Japanese firm is seen as a community with a common destiny Japanese Managers 
The themes of harmony between departments and people overreaching objectives management style and hard and soft management skills have been persuasively offered as characteristics of the art of Japanese management Pascale Athos 
The principal finding in this study is the relatively high degree of similarity in perceptions between American and Japanese attributes of high personal productivity supervisors
The high correlation between item responses across the groups and the similarity of response to specific key items provides evidence of greater similarity of views than some theorists would expect
Perhaps the cofounder of Honda Motor Company was right when he remarked that American and Japanese management are alike yet differ in all important respects Ouchi 
This research would suggest that the areas of dissimilarity are relatively few are principlecentered and constitute important features of the Japanese management style
Fortyeight US Air Force Academy cadets were studied to examine the effects of individual attitudes and organizational reward structures on the performance of a complex integrative task
An attitudinal survey was used to measure each subject s preference for cooperative or competitive situations
Distinctly different group environments were created by giving four groups of six subjects competitive instructions and another four groups cooperative instructions
The performance criterion was the sum score across eight trials of a complex arcadetype computer game which required one subject to control horizontal movement and another to control vertical movement
Although neither attitude nor reward structure alone influenced performance their interaction was found to be very significant subjects performed poorly when the reward structure did not match their individual orientation
Implications for military and professional training programs are discussed
Deutsch identified two types of situations as end points on a continuum of interpersonal relations within groups
He defined cooperative situations as those in which the goals of all group members were positively related ie the success likely
In contrast competitive situations were defined as those in which the success of one member made the success of others in the group less probable
Deutsch found that group and individual attitudes perceptions and performance often reflect these different reward structures
Since Deutsch educational social and industrial psychologists have studied the effects of alternative reward structures on a variety of tasks in many different settings
Although most published reports suggest advantages for cooperative reward structures Johnson Johnson many institutions continue to employ individual competition in attempts to increase motivation and enhance performance Klein 
Other studies have suggested that enduring individual differences in beliefs orientations or preferences ie traits are a primary influence on behavior Epstein Jackson Paunonen 
A study by Cohen showed not only that some subjects had a marked preference for either competitive or cooperative reward structures but that these preferences affected a variety of individual and group outcomes belief or value systems
In real life such personal epistemologies are often more potent predictors of performance and satisfaction than traditional individual difference measures such as speed or intelligence Greeno 
Although results of studies of the effect of attitudes on group productivity are somewhat inconsistent cooperative persons tend both to engender and to report higher levels of satisfaction Shaw 
In this study we sought to vary independently both reward structure and individual attitudes toward these structures
Reward structure was manipulated to create either competitive or cooperative groups of six subjects
Based on their responses to an attitude survey subjects were selectively assigned to groups with either competitive or cooperative orientations
The primary criterion was performance on a demanding arcadetype computer game modified to require coordinated inputs from two subjects simultaneously
Hence this study sought to identify the main and interactive effects of situational and individual factors on performance and satisfaction
It was hypothesized that advantages associated with cooperative reward structures and cooperative would extend to this complex interactive task
METHOD
Fortyeight freshman cadets fortyone male and seven female between the ages of eighteen and twentyone volunteered to participate in this study
Although subjects did not receive remuneration participation in this experiment excused them from two hours of unpleasant training and prizes were offered for top performers
As cadets our subjects were part of a select group of young adults
Cadets at the Air Force Academy have average SAT scores of were in the top of their graduating high school class and earned one or more varsity letters in athletics
As a group since cadets display such homogeneity on many measures of academic and athletic achievement they are often a poor experimental sample for individual difference studies
Their distinctiveness from the general population and restricted range are both problematic
However cadets do represent many young adults who are competitively selected for entry and education in the most demanding professions
It is also true that despite their similarity in achievements fiveitem attitudinal survey was used to measure subjects preferences for cooperative or competitive environments Figure 
Subjects were required to indicate their agreement or disagreement with each statement on a point scale
Three of the statements reflected individually competitive orientations ie and and two reflected cooperative orientations ie and 
The sum of a subject s responses to the competitive statements were subtracted from the sum of hisher responses to the cooperative statements the difference was used as a measure of cooperative orientation
The Whale Game an arcadetype computer game was the criterion task
Specially developed to study human performance this game requires subjects to guide a blue whale to accomplish two distinctly different tasks eating plankton or crashing kayaks
Planktoneating is a tracking task which requires subjects to guide the whale toward a randomly drifting plankton target
This task is generally simple but the unpredictable movement of the plankton makes it uncertain and rather demanding
In contrast kayaks appear at discrete locations on the screen perimeter at predetermined times throughout the game
Once on screen the kayaks move one space horizontally and vertically toward the whale
This pursuit continues until either the kayak reaches the whale or crashes into one of twenty stationary icebergs displayed on the screen throughout the game
Subjects lose points for being harpooned but gain points if the kayaks crash
Subjects are given explicit priority instructions at the beginning of each trial telling them which of the tasks is more important ie worth ten times more points
Groups of eight subjects completed the attitudinal survey and received basic instruction in the Whale Game during an initial onehour session
They accomplished eight practice trials four of each priority and recorded their scores at the end of each trial
Subjects were then assigned to eight sixperson groups such that each group s average performance during the initial session had been equivalent
Seven of the groups contained one female and five male cadets the eighth was all male
No
Within these constraints distinctly competitive or cooperative groups were created to accentuate individual attitudes through mutual reinforcement
A onehour experimental session took place approximately six weeks after the initial training session
The second independent variable in this study was the taskreward structure
Four groups received competitive instructions another four received cooperative instructions
A competitive reward structure was imposed by telling the six subjects in a particular group that only the top scorer among them would be invited to a pizza party
Although most college freshmen would not see this reward as very significant our subjects seemed quite taken by it
The same reward was offered to cooperative groups but the criterion was changed
The cooperative reward structure was established by telling subjects that the combined score of all group members would be compared to the scores of other groups all members of the group with the highest total score would be invited to the pizza party
Thus in the competitive groups the object was to perform better than other members to maximize the performance of the whole group
Two different dependent measures were of interest
Task performance was measured by the total number of points scored on the two game tasks eating plankton and crashing kayaks
The game itself was identical to the one subjects had learned during the initial session but the way it was played was not
The six subjects in each group shared three computers
For each trial one subject controlled the horizontal movement of the whale and another controlled the vertical movement
This manipulation forced subjects to interact with one another as would an aircrew
Subjects rotated so that they played one game of each priority with each of the other five subjects
Each subject controlled horizontal whale movement during five trials and vertical movement on the other five
Both subjects shared the same score for a given trial but the rotation allowed overall individual scores to vary greatly
At the end of the session subjects were asked to respond to five questions using a six point scale
their willingness to participate in future experiments
The average rating on these five questions was used as a measure of their satisfaction the second dependent variable
RESULTS
Results from attitudinal questions showed that our subjects did vary in their attitudes toward competition and cooperation
The distribution appeared to be normal with scores ranging from to 
Although data could have been partitioned to examine the effects of practice or differences in the two subtasks this design supported only using a single aggregate measure of performance for each subject
Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the effects of attitudes and reward structure on this measure of overall performance
In the first step of the analysis both attitude and reward structure were entered into the regression equation
The main effects of these two variables explained less than of the variance in performance
However when the interaction reflected by the product of the two variables was entered the portion of the variance explained r increased to 
The beta F 
Score Attitude Rewards
 Interaction
To depict these results graphically subjects were divided into three groups competitive neutral cooperative and their respective mean scores were plotted separately for the two reward structures
The interaction can be clearly seen in Figure below
The greatest effects of reward structure were seen in the performance of those with the most pronounced attitudes toward either competition or cooperation
Satisfaction was also an important dependent measure
In this case however the analysis showed that only subjects attitudes had a significant effect
The correlation between attitude and satisfaction was df p two tailed
Cooperative individuals were more satisfied and willing to participate in future experiments
This result is not surprising what is surprising is the lack of significant relationships between satisfaction and reward structure r the reward structure interaction r and even task performance r 
Briefly these results suggest performance was better when the reward structure matched the individual s preference
This effect appeared to be particularly detrimental to those individuals with strong attitudes who found themselves laboring under incompatible reward structures
Those with moderate attitudes appeared to be able to perform well in either environment
Satisfaction was unaffected by performance or reward structure but showed a positive linear relationship with subjects expressed preference for cooperation
DISCUSSION
The expected direct relationship between cooperative attitudes and reward structures was not found
However the pattern of results provides interesting insights into the dynamics which may underline other successful demonstrations of the benefits of cooperation
Earlier the issue was raised that Air Force Academy cadets differ somewhat from other college freshmen
One difference is the high level and diversity of their high school achievements
If one assumes that a competitive attitude is positively associated with the academic athletic and extracurricular achievements used for selection to enter the Academy our sample may have been more competitive than subjects in relatively cooperative attitudes are considered who might better represent a normal population there appears to be clear support for the proposition that cooperative reward structures increase performance
Although attempts were made to employ an experimental task with enhanced ecological validity the duration of this experiment was less than one hour
Most studies which have successfully demonstrated the advantages of cooperation have involved weeks months or even years of task performance
Might we expect advantages to accrue to cooperative groups if this experiment were similarly extended Cooperative individuals were more satisfied and also more willing to participate in future experiments regardless of the reward structure or level of performance
To the extent that this increased motivation would lead to greater persistence and more rapid skill acquisition cooperative subjects might improve in comparison to their lesssatisfied morecompetitive peers
Additionally we might expect positive relationships and social support systems to develop among the groups of cooperative individuals with either reward structure
Implications of these results for military and professional training interpersonal competition as a mechanism for increasing trainees motivation and ostensibly their performance
Our results suggest that the shortterm effect of such a policy on performance is nil
Emphasis on competition will enhance the performance of some trainees but will inhibit the performance of others
This begs the question of which trainees are helped and which are hindered by such a policy
Ideally those who are most likely to become competent and dedicated members of operational units are those whose performance should be facilitated
However just the opposite result may occur if competitive reward structures are employed to train individuals for work environments in which teamwork and cooperation are required
Competitive reward structures benefit competitive individuals
Competitive individuals especially those with pronounced biases are likely to perform poorly in cooperative environments
Additionally competitive individuals seem less likely to be satisfied regardless of their level of performance or the type of reward structure
From this perspective part of the answer to the question Where have all our pilots gone becomes distressingly clear This paper compares and contrasts statements made by American and European psychiatrists on the etiology of schizophrenia
In the US leading figures in psychiatry hold increasingly to the view that the disorder is physiogenic at source from which it seems to follow that the appropriate treatments should similarly focus on physiological and pharmacological therapies
In contrast European psychiatrists seem to be divided in support for organic and psychodynamic explanations
Some European writers have pointedly warned against overinterpreting recent studies which seem to point to specific organic dysfunctions and deficits as schizophrenogenic
For the past few years the newspapers periodically have reported that new discoveries are indicating that many psychiatric disorders are caused by organic factors
While such studies tend to be experimental and require further research more and more people are inclined to believe that all mental aberrations are either biologically or genetically determined
Of course schizophrenia and depression the flagships of psychiatry top the list
It seems that behind every distorted thought there is a distorted molecule or a distorted
For example a heading on the first page of the New York Times by Schmeck November states GENETIC BASIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IS SAID TO BE FOUND
According to this report in the British journal Nature a link was found between schizophrenia and an abnormally functioning gene or cluster of genes on a part of Chromosome 
The gene itself is still to be identified
The newspaper journalist reports that in the same issue of the journal another international research team reported that it found no link between schizophrenia and Chromosome 
However the two studies involved different groups of people families in Britain and Iceland in the first study and a large family in Sweden in the second
According to the second group of investigators there is no conflict between the two studies since schizophrenia appears to be a biologically heterogeneous group of diseases
While the first group may have a type that is reflected in Chromosome the schizophrenics in the other study may
From these two studies it seems that DSMIII has not solved the problem of diagnoses of the disorder
The conclusion drawn by the journalist writing in the Times is that both studies are important on two counts
The first provides solid evidence italics added of a biological cause of some forms of schizophrenia
Therefore the evidence of a destructive upbringing or other bad early social experience is proven to be false
The second conclusion is that this finding is a first step in breaking the disease category into individual subtypes which may enable investigators to find effective treatment for specific types of schizophrenia
However in a telephone interview one of the investigators told the journalist that for the present the new research has no immediate application to diagnosis or treatment of schizophrenia in general
Bellak a wellknown expert on schizophrenia found it necessary to react critically to the article by writing a letter to the editor of the New York Times in which he indicates that if reduction to single cause psychological care in its many facets will be underestimated
That would be a disservice to the patient and to society which often has to bear the financial and sometimes traumatic burdens
Let us not engage in simplistic black and white thinking November 
The print media have also reported on the biological and genetic underpinnings of other disorders
Other conditions where these are purportedly involved include anxiety impotence anorexia nervosa bulimia substance abuse hyperactivity and dyscalculia
Headlines announced the following discoveries Brain defects in violent people New York Times A biological link behind borderline personalities Newsday Schizophrenia focus shifts to dramatic changes in brain New York Times Studying the biochemistry of panic Newsday nd Genetic defect linked to illness Manicdepressive disorders are traced to faulty gene on the X Chromosome New York Times New focus on multiple personality
Times Sleeping pills related to schizophrenia New York Post Clues to suicide A brain chemical is implicated New York Times Blue genes Find them cure depression Daily News 
An exaggerated statement reported in the New York Times on November prompted me to write this paper
A full page ad appeared with the heading MENTAL ILLNESS IS CURABLE
BUT PUBLIC APATHY MUST BE CURED FIRST
Maestro Leonard Bernstein led the way to find a cure
The purpose of the ad was a major fundraising drive of to find a cure for schizophrenia and depression
This drive was initiated by the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression NARSAD
Leonard Bernstein was enlisted to usher in this drive by conducting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra on November in a performance at Avery Fisher Hall
The parent organization for NARSAD is the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill NAMI for the reader regarding the cause of mental illness
It is defined as a brain disease which affects million people of all ages
The cause in no uncertain terms is described as being due to biological and genetic factors
The actual words of the ad are as follows Mental illness is a real scientific and biological entity as clearly as cancer multiple sclerosis and diabetes are scientific and biological entities
p
A
Certainly in view of the still controversial findings in the literature regarding the specific causes of mental illness this description overstates the case
A similar ad appeared in the New York Times on September in which October was proclaimed as Mental Illness Awareness Week by Governor Mario Cuomo
It included the same definition as in the previous ad indicating that mental illnesses are real biological diseases
""
Later in this paper I shall provide examples of professionals in the United States equating mental disorders with diseases this aspect I will document what some of the outstanding European psychiatrists have to say about the nature of schizophrenia and the problems involved in the use of neuroleptics
First I shall report on statements made by the National Schizophrenia Fellowship of the United Kingdom in their promotional material Annual Report 
The National Schizophrenia Fellowship like the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill is primarily an organization of parents whose offsprings are schizophrenic
The following quotations indicate their views on causality in schizophrenia taken from a leaflet entitled Schizophrenia Notes for relatives and friends no June 
Because the patient can not usually explain what is happening in his mind it is not easy for other people even those who live with him to realize that many of the odd or upsetting things he does are caused by the illness
It is especially hard because it is a mental and not a physical disease
Italics added p 
In another leaflet of raised as to what causes schizophrenia
The answer provided follows No one knows
It is not even known whether schizophrenia is really one condition or many perhaps with various causes
These statements certainly contrast sharply with the philosophy of NAMI in the USA and perhaps refreshingly so
Since no one has been able to find the cause or causes of schizophrenia it is much better and wiser to leave the matter of causation open rather than to become a firm believer in weak evidence
The general public does not possess the critical knowledge to evaluate the overstated pronouncements in the news radio and TV media
To further illustrate the openness of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship their August Annual Report has an article which reads as follows NEW DRUGS A DOSE OF REALISM
The front page of the May issue of NSF News leaves the reader with the impression that a major advance in the drug therapy of schizophrenia is just around the corner
Admittedly this is qualified here and there but input of large sums of cash and retaining of professionals to make this a reality
As the father of a daughter with schizophrenia and as a Group Coordinator I only wish that this were so
However I am also a professional pharmacologist engaged in the teaching of medical students
I was involved in this area of research in the s and my current research specialty is neuropharmacology
In these roles I must be more critical
It is particularly important that the expectations of patients relatives professional careers and politicians alike are not raised above realistic levels
For this reason I would like to give a more cautious view of the present situation with regard to the new drug GRF produced by Glaxo Laboratories
p I STATEMENTS BY EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRISTS ON THE ORGANICITY OF MENTAL DISORDERS
In Hafner a German psychiatrist who is the director of a new center of psychiatric research in Mannheim edited a book entitled Search for the causes of schizophrenia in which a number of European he stated our knowledge of the etiology of the disease called schizophrenia has not yet made much progress from Kraepelin s days p 
Further the attempt to bridge the gap between pathogenesis and the etiology is still a daring undertaking p 
He feels that the research might have eliminated some false hypotheses
According to Karl Popper this is the most important way to get nearer to the truth
Stromgren the wellknown investigator and former director of the Aarhus Mental Hospital in Risskow Denmark stated clearly that we should provide the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
With regard to the causes of schizophrenia we seem to by now have found nearly everything except the truth p 
Janzarik a psychiatrist from Bulgaria writing on the concept of schizophrenia indicated that so far there is no conclusively defined disease known as schizophrenia of the concept is not based on medical discovery but rather on the intellectual model on which the orientation of the psychiatrist is based
Shepherd of the Bethlehem Royal Hospital of London advocates a research of wider scope than the purely organic
He states I would emphasize that in the absence of an established biological marker for the clinical investigator the significance of all such factors whether they be life events or viruses family communications or season of birth depends on the strength of an association and is therefore essentially epidemiological p 
Wing another wellknown British psychiatrist from Maudsley was able to show that poverty in the social environment was a cause of clinical deterioration Wing Brown 
In he pointed out that basically all we know is that the age and sex distribution in schizophrenia is unlike that in any other major psychiatric disorder
It runs a more sinister course for males and few schizophrenics seem to the small nuggets of knowledge dredged from a sea of ignorance p 
Hirsch of the London Westminster School of Medicine expresses his doubts about the significance of disparate findings in the study of schizophrenia
He writes Are these findings specific for schizophrenics or would other chronic institutionalized patients such as oligophrenics and chronic manicdepressives show the same changes Are they secondary to the disease process CSF and CAT scan findings may reflect changes which are the result of arousal mechanisms deficient diet local epidemics etc
He further states It is therefore particularly important these studies be replicated in other cohorts in other places p 
Benedetti a Swiss psychiatrist who worked with Manfred Bleuler at the Burgholzli Clinic in Zurich writes the following in his recent publication regarding the limitations of biological causality
""
""
""
The lack of specific anatomical and biological findings in schizophrenia in spite of half a as they are in cerebral paralysis or in arteriosclerosis cerebri or in some inborn error of metabolism they would by their very presence reduce but of course not cancel the spectrum of psychological causality
p 
Another argument which Benedetti uses is the fact that there is a constant occurrence of schizophrenia in spite of the relatively low fertility rate of schizophrenics
Let me pursue further some of the writings that have appeared in Europe regarding the use of drugs and other organic therapies
Minton medical director of Hampton Hospital in England reviews the changes in clinical practice from to 
He believes that the retention of drug therapy has made it possible for psychiatric personnel to accept the reality of a therapeutic contract with their patients only because at the back of their minds they have given greater weight to the efficacy of the drugs than to the wider social values of a more respectful approach to the patient and his treatment p 
With regard to shock therapies could be attributed to psychosocial factors involved in the treatment rather than the direct action of insulin
Interpersonal relationships between personnel and patients had to improve with close supervision of these patients under insulin treatment
Regarding ECT Minton is amazed at the amount of time and effort expended on arguments about the merits of different electrical waveforms and current strengths when so little was done to inquire about the effects of the treatment
Some psychiatrists have seemingly been fascinated by gadgetry with no real interest in the patient
With regard to psychosurgery Minton writes that It is very doubtful if these modernday prenologists of the innards of the brain have any greater claim to accuracy in their predictions than their nineteenth century predecessors who more modestly and less dangerously settled for prediction based on surface lumps and bumps p 
He is quite surprised at the blind acceptance of these three therapies in vogue despite their immediate danger in disabling patients
He hopes that psychiatrists might organize their discipline to ensure proper Clare in discussing treatment and cure in mental illness is not optimistic that solutions are around the corner
He writes the following which reflects his discouragement at the slow progress in effectively tackling mental disorders
The natural history of most common mental disorders has still to be established Shepherd the majority of treatments currently in use are empirical Clare and in so far as treatments as varied as ECT and psychotherapy do appear to bring about remission there is still much discussion as the relative importance of placebo effect spontaneous remission and chance in effecting such change
Hogan 
Yet some two decades ago psychiatry appeared poised on the threshold of revolutionary breakthroughs in treatment
However the changes in psychiatry do not meet the criteria of what constitutes a revolution there has been no overthrow of established systems of thought and no significant break with the major therapeutic schools of the past years
The enthusiasm of the vantagepoint of history singularly misplaced
The fact that different developments in therapy from psychotherapy to psychotropics from social psychiatry to behavioral approaches have all in their time been dubbed revolutionary only further illustrates the tendency of psychiatrists in common with other active practitioners to believe that they live in an age of rapid and impressive advance
Lewis 
He indicates that when psychiatrists find themselves with a tool which is believed to be effective they tend to use it indiscriminately
He quotes Sudhoff s analogy of a bad cobbler who tries to fit everyone with the same shoe
Deniker the French psychiatrist who was responsible with Delay for the introduction of neuroleptics around the world in clearly states that the future of psychopharmacology seems in question p 
This was included in his presidential address of the International Convention of the Association of Biological Psychiatry of entitled Should We Withdraw Antipsychotic Drugs treatment of depression believed to be the easiest of the psychoses to treat indicates that the situation has been dismal
He writes the following The results of the drugs are not impressive considering the fact that placebo is useful in one third of the cases p 
Furthermore he states in the last decade Americans have outdone the Europeans in cultivating the Kraepelinian viewpoint in psychiatry p 
Dick a Swiss psychiatrist after having analyzed the literature on the uses of Lithium primarily from American psychiatric journals concludes with the following strong remarks
Because of the imprecision of Lithium and the insufficiency of its foundation it does not allow actually not even to predict or even reveal useful signs or even factors of probability susceptible to orient toward the possibility of the efficacy of Lithium
Translated from the French p 
""
That statement certainly contrasts with a recent review on the uses of both of New York Hospital in which they state
A review of Lithium treatment ten years ago might have focused in its efficacy in acute mania and in prophylaxis of bipolar illness
While the role of Lithium salts in the treatment of these conditions is now unquestioned new issues are emerging Now it has become a part of standard psychiatric practice and has achieved widespread acceptance by the lay public
These gains are real but much work needs to be done to explore the expanding indications of Lithium use p 
One would certainly wonder how such differences in conclusions could be made on the basis of the same literature
While the label of wonder drugs is often used by news media and even psychiatrists a recently edited book by Daly and Sand from Ireland and Belgium respectively entitled Psychological Treatment of Mental Illness Research Strategies and Diagnosis contains the following as a selfadvertisement The growing dissatisfaction with the excessive use of drugs has encouraged illness
The volume is the result of the work conducted by the Study Group of Mental Illness a priority activity of the European Medical Research Council one of the five standing committees of the European Science Foundation
Some time ago I wrote to Goodwin an English psychiatrist at the Medical Research Council in Edinburgh who had been highly critical of a book on the biology of schizophrenia by Trimble 
I asked whether he had further written criticism of the organic ideology
He responded with the following letter dated November 
Thank you for your letter and the reprint of your paper on the issue of organic aetiology in psychiatric illness
I am a psychiatrist with a traditional British training and I think I share the consensus view of British psychiatry at present that the major psychiatric disorders certainly in adults must have some underlying biological substrate which we can also choose to call vulnerability to account for the evidence of a strong genetic effect A reading of any of the major recent text books of psychiatry published in this country would I think reflect this view
Antipsychiatry as embodied by Ronnie Laing in the s is virtually a dead duck amongst psychiatrists although it still has a certain following particularly among paramedical staff particularly social workers and nurses
Clinical psychologists in this country are increasingly interested in therapy rather than theory and the major focus at the moment is behavior therapy or cognitive therapy
That said my criticism of Michael Trimble s book was not its orientation but the extent to which it reflected an approach where the current evidence for organic aetiology was held to be overwhelming and convincing
Furthermore it seemed to me to neglect the importance of genetic evidence in supporting the biological position
To leave that out seems to me to leave the Emperor with no clothes at all to speak of
I ca nt claim to have written anywhere else about this problem at any length but I think that it s an emergent one in British psychiatry in the last five years has evolved as a series of increasingly improbably speculations about the molecular basis of schizophrenia
What concerns me about this is that scientific findings and logic are misapplied in the same way that psychoanalysis misapplied its version of observation and logic
In the end it may not matter eventually what anyone says in besides the certainty as I see it that we will see progress in the understanding of the aetiology of the major functional psychoses in the next decade
However currently I think there is nothing to be gained and a good deal to be lost by making exaggerated claims for the organicists position which is unsupported by valuable experimental investigation
I am not sure that there need be a particularly vigorous controversy of the sort that you describe for autism
Most people here assume that major psychiatric disorder requires first of all the genetic or phenotypic predisposition combined with environmental TOOLONG
Controversy seems to arise out of seeing these mutually nonexclusive classes of influence in psychiatry as being actually mutually sincerely G M Goodwin MD
Of course I agreed with his statement that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by making exaggerated claims for the organicist position which is unsupported by experimental investigation
In view of the interesting remarks made by Dr Goodwin I asked him for authorization to use his letter in some of my writing
The response which I received is just as pertinent as the first letter
It reads as follows under date of December 
Thank you for your recent letter
I have no objections to your including my previous comments in your work
However I would be glad if you would not refer to my remarks about Dr Although his published contributions could illustrate the point that I was making I do nt want this to become in any way personal and particularly not by being quoted at one removed
I am sure you would agree that the argument is about ideas and I think you are probably right to highlight the USA
I suppose historically this has to be seen as a reaction against previous dominance of psychoanalysis which was equally far from the general European position but in a sense in the other direction
As I said in my previous letter I am sure you would find plenty of support for your thesis in any recent text book of psychiatry published in the UK II
VIEWS EXPRESSED BY PSYCHIATRISTS IN THE USA REGARDING THE ETIOLOGY OF MENTAL DISORDERS
I shall now turn to statements made by major psychiatrists on the etiology of schizophrenia which tend to be somewhat emphatic regarding its causes
Andreasen is an American psychiatrist on the staff of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Iowa College of Medicine and is on the editorial staff of the American Journal of Psychiatry
She was also a member of the DSMIII Commission 
In she wrote a book on the biology of mental disorders which is extreme in its orientation
That book The Broken Brain The Biological Revolution in Psychiatry states mentally ill can change only through increased understanding and knowledge
The change will be speeded up further if people have an opportunity to learn about the transformations that have been occurring in psychiatry during the past ten to twenty years
Psychiatry like the prodigal son has returned home to its place as a specialty within the field of medicine
It has become increasingly scientific and biological in its orientation
Psychiatry now recognizes that the serious mental illnesses are diseases in the same sense that cancer or high blood pressure are diseases
Mental illnesses are diseases that affect the brain which is an organ of the body just as the heart or stomach is
People who suffer from mental illness suffer from a sick or broken brain not from weak will laziness bad character or bad upbringing Italics added
The recognition that mental illnesses are diseases affecting the brain is the basis of the biological revolution in psychiatry
This teaching has already done a great deal to diminish the fear shame and to understand its implications better we should enter a new era of genuine enlightenment concerning the nature of mental illness
Its victims and their friends and relatives will understand its nature and causes and be able to discuss them without shame and embarrassment
p 
In another part of the book she writes
The major psychiatric illnesses are diseases
They should be considered medical illnesses just as diabetes heart disease and cancer are
p 
As a result of her convictions she further writes the following pointing out the needed changes that took place with the introduction of the DSMIII which she helped to formulate
A second implication of DSMIII affects the way psychiatrists evaluate and interview their patients
Ten or twenty years ago the patient who sought out psychiatric care was likely to receive and also pay for a relaxed and leisurely series of interviews
The doctor would ask the patient about a wide range of subjects in considerable detail including early childhood with his wife and children his attitude toward his boss or his work and his feelings about himself
Somewhere embedded among these queries about personal and social aspects of his life were questions about his symptoms
While psychoanalysts will no doubt continue to use this type of approach in spite of DSMIII and indeed many of their concerns and techniques have little to do with the specific disorders described in DSMIII the majority of psychiatrists are likely to focus on an evaluation of symptoms much more quickly
They will usually attempt to determine the patient s diagnosis during the first onehour interview and will begin treatment whether it be medication or psychotherapy rather quickly after the first appointment
Whereas the older style of psychiatric interviewing used to stress the openended question and abundant use of noncommittal uhs and ums interviews based on a DSMIII approach are likely to be similar to those of internists or other doctors
Italics added
The patient will be asked rather focused and detailed questions How has your appetite been p 
This emphasis in dwelling on symptoms suffered by patients rather than finding out how they see their problems is illustrated in a book by Kleinman who reported on the results of an ethnographic study of psychiatric practice in the USA and China
He provides verbatim the exchange between a depressed research physician and a senior psychiatrist
The latter after the first interview prescribed Doxepin for the depression
That same day the physician wrote the following in his diary
I do nt think he heard me
I wanted him to listen to me not for the diagnosis but for the story my story
I know I m depressed
But I wanted him to hear what is wrong
Depression may be the disease but it is not the problem
The problem is my life
The center does nt hold
Things fall apart
It s falling apart
My marriage
My relationship with my kids
My My dreams
Is this the depression Maybe it caused the depression
Maybe the depression makes it worse or seem worse
But these problems also have their own legitimate reality
This is my life no matter if I am depressed or not
And that is what I want to talk about to complain about to make sense of to get help to put back together again
I want this depression treated all right
There is something more I want however
I want to tell this story my story
I want someone trained to hear me
I thought that was what psychiatrists do
Someone ought to do it ought to help me tell what has happened
But all he seemed interested in was the diagnosis and my dad s death
I m sure that is part of it but so much else is going on
I need to talk to someone about my whole world not just one part of it
p 
That therapy seems to end with a simple labeling and the prescription of a drug
Kleinman seems to be one of the few psychiatrists in the USA who are fighting Andreasen s extreme reductionism
I shall provide here an extensive quotation from Kleinman s book which focuses on the forces which prevent psychiatry from looking beyond the immediacy of relieving symptoms with medication
There is a systematic resistance to dealing with social sources of depression and other psychiatric conditions
Perhaps the idea strikes clinicians as simply too difficult to operationalize in practical programs
Perhaps it also is too threatening since it suggests that expensive social programs may be more availing in the long run as prevention than the use of drugs and psychotherapy to treat individual episodes of disease Eisenberg 
There is also the unappealing reality that drug companies and psychotherapists derive economic gain and livelihood from the treatment of depression no particular commercial interests will benefit from preventive programs in spite of the fact that such programs would contribute importantly to the economy of disability
There is no effective lobby for social research and sociotherapies to counteract the powerful lobby for biological research and treatments
And the exploitive orientation of the media to the latest scientific breakthroughs assures that biological rather than social issues will receive attention
Even the families of the mentally ill find biological causes more acceptable since they indicate that mental illness is like all other disorders and they remove some of the burden of guilt
The cultural argument is that this situation is a symptom of the dominant forces in our society and its institutions
In spite of the interests of some psychiatrists and psychologists in social factors and prevention the orientation of the mental health professionals overall contributes to this problem
For psychiatry the neurosciences hold out the hope of escaping marginality and catching up with the rest of biomedicine Eisenberg for psychology cognitive science and behavioral medicine are the darlings of research funding agencies and hold the promise of financial support for clinical specialists
But the political economy and the cultural system the romance with biology and the devaluing of social science
p 
Kleinman received a degree in anthropology besides his medical training
In the preface of his book he deplores the fact that many psychiatrists seem to believe that an understanding of the biological basis of mental disorders is if not around the corner no more than two or three blocks away and that they tend to be deaf to cultural factors in mental disorders
Even those psychiatrists who might be involved in crosscultural research have the tendency to focus on universals in mental disorders
According to Kleinman there seems to be a tacit professional ideology that exaggerates what is universal in psychiatric disorders and deemphasize what is culturally particular p 
For example a study conducted by Sartorius revealed that chronicity is more likely to develop in advanced societies than in Third World countries
However as seen by Kleinman 
The authors are silent on these points which in this project called Determinants of Outcome
That is to say the most important finding of crosscultural difference receives scant attention compared to that devoted to the findings of crosscultural similarity
Hypotheses have been generated about the causes of differential outcome since the late s Murphy Cooper and Sartorius Waxler 
Yet none of these seems to have been tested
In the paper s conclusion the other findings of cultural differences in mode of onset symptomatology and help seeking are deemphasized as well

Similar to Andreasen s comments Torrey indicates that schizophrenia is a brain disease now definitely known to be such Italics added
Hoffer Osmond as reported by Szasz indicated that schizophrenia is a physical disease in the same way that pellagra diabetes and mental retardation are physical diseases
This deficit causes the production of a poisonous

With respect to to Andreasen only those who follow the organic view seem to have a humanistic or humane approach toward the mentally ill
Of course the point could easily be argued
Calicchia studied the attitude of the three major mental health professionals towards exmental patients and found that
The data showed that while psychiatrists perceived the exmental patient to be relatively safe they considered them sic to be somewhat worthless and incomprehensible but even more significantly they viewed them sic as extremely ineffectual and undesirable
Social workers on the other hand perceived the exmental patients worth and comprehensibility in a relatively neutral light and while they considered them to be somewhat dangerous and ineffectual they also viewed them as very undesirable
Psychologists in contrast perceived the exmental patient as worthy safe and acceptable although somewhat ineffective and very mysterious
p 
This certainly is contrary to Andreasen s view that an organic ideology is more likely to make mental patients more acceptable
Siegler Models of Madness Models of Medicine extol the virtues of recent developments in psychiatry
They feel that psychoanalysis has robbed people of their medical rights
Even when there is no wholly satisfactory treatment for an illness a physician can make certain timehonored moves that will alleviate the suffering of the patient and his family
He can give the disease a name and thus reduce its mystery Italics added
He can rule out other and worse illnesses
He can reassure the patient and his family that the illness is a natural occurrence and that no one is to blame for it
Exercising his authority he can confer the sick role on patients which places them within the medical model of illness
He can offer them the best available treatment
He can tell the patient s family that he is doing everything that he can to help the sick person get well
We believe these moves are precious and ancient rights attached to the sick role in clinical medicine

to the methods used by internists Lipkowitz Idupuganti sent a questionnaire to five percent of the members of the American Psychiatric Association regarding the diagnosis of schizophrenia
Of twentytwo symptoms four hallucinations delusions affect disturbance and thought or language disorder were most commonly mentioned but the concordance level was only fifty percent
Commenting on their findings they write the following
One of the major benefits of current research and of DSMIII is the separation of schizophrenia from other disorders that at present are far more effectively treated
Our study raises the disturbing possibility that this research has not had a substantial effect on the diagnostic practices of US psychiatrists and that as a result many patients are not receiving appropriate treatment
Although this study does not flatter the current diagnostic practices of US psychiatrists it does indicate that some change is occurring
Younger psychiatrists tend to use criteria other than symptoms that have historically been considered pathognomonic for schizophrenia but that in hope that this trend will continue both for an improvement in the reliability of the diagnosis of schizophrenia and for increased specificity in the treatment of psychotic patients
p 
This seems to counter Andreasen s belief that the DSMIII may be used with the accuracy of a medical diagnostic tool
Andreasen has edited a more recent book entitled Can Schizophrenia Be Localized in the Brain in which she expresses her enthusiasm regarding the connection between mental disorder and dysfunction of the brain
Psychiatry is only beginning to reclaim the brain as its organ
We are fortunate to specialize in the diseases of the most interesting complex and important organ in the entire body
We are rediscovering what Hippocrates already knew in the fourth century BC Almost everything that we think do and feel derives from the brain
Mental illness arises when the brain goes awry in some way giving abnormal commands that lead to abnormal thoughts feelings and actions
Hippocrates knew this the discipline of neuroscience during recent decades gives us hope that we may actually be able to understand the brain mechanisms producing mental illness during the years to come
p 
A more recent paper by Andreasen expresses her great sense of optimism regarding this approach of brain studies
Brain imaging offers psychiatry a broad range of investigative techniques that fulfill the popular fantasy of being able to read the mind albeit in the form of seeing the brain both structurally and functionally
At present brain imaging provides a modest amount of information that is useful in differential diagnosis as in distinctions between depression and dementia
It has provided more information about possible pathophysiological mechanisms of major mental illness including structural abnormalities in some forms of schizophrenia
Metabolic abnormalities such as hypofrontality in schizophrenia or hyperfrontality in obsessional disorder have also been observed
The longterm promise of brain imaging is substantial
It will permit the mapping of cerebral function in normal individuals so that we can achieve chemistry and functional organization
On the basis of this knowledge the abnormalities underlying the major mental illnesses can also be mapped
p 
But investigators on brain imaging connected with the National Institute of Mental Health tend to be less enthusiastic about this approach than Andreasen
Weinberger reviewed the findings of studies using Positron Emission Tomography PET SinglePhoton Emission Computed Tomography SPECT and the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging NMRI and he remains fundamentally uncertain that this application of modern technology will lead to a breakthrough in the understanding of functional illness
Szasz after studying standard volumes by pathologists that describe all the wellknown diseases of the brain noticed that they do not offer a single reference on schizophrenia or manicdepression
It seems according to Szasz that psychiatrists ought to convince pathologists that schizophrenia is a brain disease before they take it upon themselves to tell the public that it is such a disease p the significance of the localization of schizophrenia in the brain
It is difficult to imagine that we will ever reach the day when the movements of molecules across cell boundaries will be all that needs to be said about human love hate envy and joy
To my mind that would be an incomplete description indeed
p 
Reveley Reveley British psychiatrists from the London Institute of Psychiatry argue that recent theories in the cerebral localization of schizophrenia show how investigators have become almost desperate in their inventiveness
CONCLUSIONS
I have juxtaposed statements made by European and American psychiatrists to illustrate this fact Europeans are aware of the limitations of attributing schizophrenia solely to organic etiological factors and are aware of the limitations of the neuroleptic drugs
In contrast Americans appear absolutely sure that the disorder is caused by organic factors and that neuroleptic drugs have revolutionized psychiatry
The purpose of this article has been to illustrate the dominant ideology in the United States
One can find evidence and in newspapers
This philosophy likewise has found its way onto television in such programs as Innovation and The Mind
Of course journalists and lay persons believe in the scientific truth of these statements which are often based on little more than speculation
Thus what are presumably scientific facts are accepted uncritically by a gullible public
Some may be concerned that my references are selective and therefore not representative of American psychiatry
However this blinding effect of dogmatism Engel received some support from a survey Sanua p comparing the views of European and American psychiatrists on the etiology of infantile autism
While my survey did not refer specifically to schizophrenia I feel confident that one s ideology on infantile autism could not be much different from one s ideology on schizophrenia
While psychiatrists in the United States believe that organic factors are highly important or somewhat important the percentages for European psychiatrists were and respectively
States believe that organic factors are highly important as compared to European psychiatrists
The figures for psychologists are and and social workers and respectively
Thus it would seem that psychologists and social workers whose training should lend less support to the organic ideology tend to be more organic than physicians perhaps precisely because they lack sufficient medical or neuroscience training to be as skeptical as European psychiatrists and are to that extent almost as gullible as the public
This experiment compared the extent to which students learned facts included in computerbasedtraining frames that required an overt response to those that did not
Frames included two types of facts Some facts had one word missing which had to be supplied by the student active facts
Other facts had no missing words and required no overt response passive facts
Each student completed four fact modules in random order
Two of the modules contained frames with all active facts
Each frame in the other two modules contained one active and six passive facts
Paper pretests and posttests showed that students learned twice as many facts when all facts in the module were active than when only one in seven were active
The modules that included passive facts required onefifth the time to complete than those with only active facts
Students learned more facts per minute of training in one of the two modules that included passive facts than in the two modules with only active facts
The capacity of computerbasedtraining programs to interact with to education
Computers can measure a student s responses to questions provide immediate feedback and adjust the course content based on the speed and accuracy of student responding
This facility of computers can be utilized only to the extent that students make overt measurable responses that can be read and evaluated by computerbasedtraining programs
The role of measurable or overt responding has been investigated in the noncomputerized medium of programmed instruction
Numerous studies have shown that students learn more reliably when required to make overt responses to questions than when they are only required to read text Holland 
Furthermore students do not reliably learn extraneous material added to questions requiting overt responses Eigen Margulies 
Under some conditions students may not even read training program material that is not needed to answer the training program questions Doran Holland Doran and Holland tracked students eye movements as they completed two training programs and found that when all parts of the text were not needed to the parts of the text necessary to answer the questions
Several studies have found no differences between programs requiring overt responses and those not requiring overt responses Alter Millicent Silverman Evans Homme Glaser Hartman Morrison Carlson Goldbeck Campbell 
While some of these studies may be methodologically flawed or contain idiosyncratic features limiting their generality Holland these findings suggest that we do not completely understand the precise conditions under which overt responding in programmed instruction improves learning
Taken together the studies on overt responding in programmed instruction suggest that overt responding can significantly improve learning under some circumstances
Despite this evidence and the enormous capacity of computers to interact with students many computerbasedtraining programs have failed to maximize the use of overt responding Vargas 
The current study was undertaken to evaluate the role of overt responding in computerbasedtraining
Primarily we sought to compare the extent to which overt response to those that did not
Frames included two types of facts Some facts had one word missing which had to be supplied by the student active facts
Other facts had no missing words and required no overt response passive facts
Frames contained either a one active fact or b one active fact and six passive facts
Each student completed four modules in random order
Two of the modules contained frames with active facts
Each frame in the other two modules contained one active and six passive facts
Each of the four modules contained a total of facts
The extent to which students learned active and passive facts was evaluated on paper posttests administered after the completion of each module
This study also sought to determine if passive facts could be learned more reliably when presented in an abbreviated format that only included key words and were arranged in a quasioutline or table format in which facts are placed in predictable screen locations
To accomplish that included passive facts were constructed in the abbreviated outline format
Finally computerbased training programs frequently provide explanations after incorrect responses to questions that tell the subject why their answer was incorrect
These explanations are typically passive facts ie facts with no missing words and that require no overt responses
If students learn passive facts only inconsistently these types of explanations should be of little educational value
This experiment also evaluated the effectiveness of explanations in teaching
To accomplish this evaluation frames in only one of the two modules that included only active facts provided explanations for incorrect responses
METHOD Subjects
Sixteen normal adults served as subjects
Subjects were recruited from advertisements and paid a fixed wage for completing four computerbasedtraining modules and corresponding pretests and posttests
All subjects could read and had at least a high school diploma
Apparatus
The computerbasedtraining modules were delivered on IBM and IBM compatible XTs and ATs with at least K of memory
The modules were created and delivered using Exemplar an intelligent tutoring Inc
Exemplar has a menudriven authoring system that allows authors to create courses without a programming language
Exemplar s intelligent course tutoring system monitors student response continuously and utilizes a standard set of builtin rules to adjust the pace and content of questions based on each student s momenttomoment performance and the authorspecified module and frame parameters
Procedures
Module content
Subjects were taught seven facts about each of eight different states in the United States of America
The facts included the date that each state entered the union the numbers of counties parks and forests in each state and each state s bird flower and tree
Each module contained the seven facts about each of two different states
Modules were comprised of questions about these facts
Modules varied two question characteristics the number of facts presented in each question box and the format of the question
Question boxes either contained one or seven facts
Figure presents three sample boxes one containing one fact left box and the and right boxes
Questions containing all seven facts in one question box provided six of the state s facts in their entirety and omitted only one the name of the state s tree in the sample boxes
Modules also differed by the question format Questions were either written in complete sentences or in an outline format that only presented key words
Figure also displays the difference between sentence left and middle boxes and outline right box formats
Answers were always the date that the state entered the union the number of counties parks or forests in the state or the name of the state s bird flower or tree
For questions that contained all seven facts about a particular state in the same question box the subject only had to provide the name of the state s tree
Multiplechoice training
Figure shows the multiplechoice format in which questions were presented first
Three incorrect choices were presented with each multiplechoice question
The incorrect choices were eg the name of a bird flower or tree but the fact belonged to a different state
Since each module contained the same type of question about each of two different states eg two questions requesting the name of a state s flower the answer for one of those questions always served as an incorrect choice for the other question of similar type
For example one module contained the following two questions Arizona s state tree is
and Utah s state tree is
The answer to the first question is Paloverde and the answer to the second is Blue spruce
For these two questions Paloverde appeared as an incorrect choice when Blue spruce was the answer and Blue spruce appeared as an incorrect choice when Paloverde was the answer
The state trees for two different states not questioned in the module or in other modules in this experiment appeared as the additional incorrect choices in both questions
A similar pattern was followed for other
Multiplechoice questions appeared in boxes lines down and spaces across
Four boxes labelled F F F and F appeared below the question box
Each choice box was lines down by spaces across
A subject could answer a multiplechoice question by pressing one of the four function keys F F F or F
The locations of the correct and incorrect choices were randomized on each trial
Exemplar s intelligent tutoring system controlled and adjusted the pace with which questions and choices were presented to each learner by controlling and adjusting four timing parameters initial read and response times and final read and response times
The length of time that the question remained on screen before the choices were presented is called the read time
The time that the choices remained on screen without a subject response before they were removed is called the response time
The initial times were the read and response times for the first presentation of the question
The final read and training
Each question was assigned its own unique initial and final read and response times
Initial read times were set at seconds per line of text
Initial response final response and final read times were set at seconds seconds and seconds respectively
The read and response times were adjusted continuously as training progressed
If the subject responded correctly to a question the read and response times for that question were decreased on the next presentation of that question
Similarly if the subject responded incorrectly to a question that question s read and response times were increased on its next presentation
If a student s answer to a question was correct the other choices disappeared from the screen and the outline of the selected box thickened
If the student s answer was incorrect the other choices disappeared from the screen the outline of the selected box changed from a single to a double line and the correct answer reappeared on screen
If the subject made no correct answer thickened and the other choices disappeared from the screen
Correctincorrect feedback remained on screen for up to seconds
Explanations
In all but one experimental condition explanations were provided after incorrect responses
Explanations were tailored to each incorrect choice and specified the state to which the particular name or number ie incorrect choice belonged
The line by space explanation box appeared after the correctincorrect feedback and stayed on the screen for seconds
Explanations appeared only for the first three selections of a particular incorrect choice
Return key
Except when a multiplechoice answer was required the subject could advance from the one screen to the next at any time by pressing the Return key
Module size and number
Either two or fourteen multiplechoice questions were presented in each of four modules
Modules that presented only one fact in each question box contained fourteen questions
Modules that presented seven facts in each question box only contained two questions
Within each module questions were presented in successive a module is called a run
Questions were presented first in a fixed order for two runs
Then successive runs of randomly ordered questions were presented until all of the questions in a module were mastered
Each question was mastered and dropped from training independent of performance on all other questions in the module
A question was mastered and dropped from multiplechoice training when the subject responded on three consecutive presentations of that question correctly and within seconds
When questions were mastered they dropped from training and did not appear in subsequent runs
Fillintheblank training
After the questions of a module were mastered in multiplechoice format the same questions were presented again in successive runs of randomly ordered fillintheblank questions
The screen format of these questions was identical to multiplechoice questions except that a space blank line appeared below the question instead of the four choices
Students could use the alphanumeric keys to type answers to these questions
If the subject misspelled an answer a Misspelled message appeared on screen
was considered incorrect
The messages Correct or Incorrect appeared on screen after correct or incorrect responses respectively
As in multiplechoice modules each question was mastered and dropped from fillintheblank training when the subject responded on three consecutive presentations of that question correctly and within seconds
Feedback and read and response times were the same as in multiplechoice training
Paper pretests and posttests
Prior to initiating and immediately after completing each module each subject completed a paper pretest and posttest respectively
The pretests and posttests were identical with matrices with the seven types of facts ie date entered union number counties number parks number forests state flower state bird and state tree serving as column headings and the names of the two states taught in the justcompleted module serving as row headings
The fourteen cells comprising the matrix were empty and had to be filled with the correct answers by the
Experimental Conditions
Every subject completed four training modules and corresponding matrix pretests and posttests
Each module represented a different experimental condition and differed in the number of facts presented in each question box and the format of the question
Three of the four modules had explanations for incorrect responses
The four experimental conditions were PREFORMATTED TABLE
The order of modules was randomized for each subject
The facts about each of eight states were presented in each of the four module formats with different subjects receiving different module formatstate combinations
RESULTS Pretest to Posttest Gain
The primary results of interest were the performances on the paper pretests and posttests presented before and after each module

No other differences were significant
DISCUSSION
Students learned measurable responses to every fact included in training than when required to make overt responses to only a portion of the training facts
On the average students learned more than of the facts included in training when required to make overt responses to every fact
Alternatively students learned less than of the facts when only required to make overt responses to one in seven facts included in training
The cost to double training completeness from to of the facts learned was to multiply training time by five
This was seen in the dramatic differences in training times between the different training conditions The modules that included both active and passive facts required onefifth the time to complete approximately minutes than those that included only active facts approximately minutes
Dividing the number of facts gained from the pretest to the posttest by the number of minutes spent in training Figure provided a measure of training efficiency Roughly speaking how many facts did students learn for be qualified including both passive and active facts in training increased training efficiency
Subjects learned more facts per minute of training in one of the two conditions that included passive facts Active PassiveSentence Condition than in the two conditions that included only active facts
This effect on training efficiency of including passive facts in training was not so robust because the other condition that included passive facts Active PassiveOutline Condition did not show statistically significant improved training efficiency over the two conditions that included only active facts although the mean number of facts gained per minute of training was greater in Active PassiveOutline Condition than in the two conditions that included only active facts
Some of this increased training efficiency may have resulted from the fact that students learned some of the passive facts even though they were not required to make overt responses to them
The two modules that included passive facts required an overt response for only of the facts included and tested in the module of the facts Active PassiveOutline or Active PassiveSentence of the facts as measured by pretest to posttest gain Figure 
As in programmed instruction Eigen Margulies Doran Holland Holland these results suggest that computerbased training may be most effective when students are required to make overt responses to all of the facts included in training
Furthermore students may learn only a small percentage of facts for which overt responses are not required
The above interpretation attributes the pretestposttest differences between Active Only and Active Passive modules to the presence or absence of passive facts
Although this interpretation is plausible it must be accepted with some caution
In addition to differing on the presence or absence of passive facts the two types of modules also differed in the number of questions included per module Active Only modules included questions per module while Active and Passive modules included only two questions per module
Thus it is possible that pretest to posttest module increases
This proposition requires independent evaluation
Presenting passive facts in outline as opposed to sentence form did not affect any of the measures
Providing explanations for incorrect responses did not appear to contribute to either training efficiency or effectiveness
The utility of these two features was evaluated for restricted subject matter facts about states
Perhaps these features would prove more useful in the training of other subject matter
These features should be evaluated in the training of different types of material before firm conclusions about their utility are reached
The results of this experiment suggest that there may be an advantage to including passive facts in training Students may learn more facts for every training minute when passive facts are included in computerbased training screens
Future research should conduct parametric analyses to determine if some ratio of passive to active facts included in computerbasedtraining modules could retain the training efficiency advantage of passive facts without reducing training effectiveness
Our major conclusion is that requiring an overt response for each fact doubled the amount learned at Displaying facts in outline form produced no different effects than in sentence form and explanations of incorrect answers had no measured effects
Seventyfour university undergraduates male and female reporting difficulty in giving and receiving criticism were randomly assigned to either a training group consisting of cognitive behavioral criticism skills including behavior rehearsal modeling coaching cognitive restructuring or to a control group
Dependent measures were given at pretest posttest and one year followup
Included were selfreport measures consisting of Fear of Negative Evaluation FNE Criticism Concerns Scale CCS Criticism SelfEsteem Giving and Receiving Scales and behavioral roleplay measures consisting of judges global ratings of subject s verbal and nonverbal criticism behaviors in roleplay scenarios with a live actor
Results for the selfreport measures FNE and Criticism SelfEsteem Receiving showed both training program and control groups improved at posttest but only the training program group maintained gains at one year followup
For the CCS and Criticism SelfEsteem Giving the training program group improved over time yet was only signficantly different from control group at posttest
Results were discussed in terms of the proactive nature criticism
Many individuals find it difficult to receive and embarrassing to give criticism Weisinger Lobsenz Adler 
Receiving criticism is associated with low selfesteem Simon Smith Adler feelings of inadequacy Butler Simon stress and anger Butler Whitman Spendlove Clark and failure pain and embarrassment Simon Adler 
The idea of being criticized can prevent people from doing things taking on challenges and stretching their minds or skills Weisinger Lobsenz Simon 
It would appear the use of criticsm skills activates irrational beliefs and anxiety stemming from reduced selfesteem from individuals with a high fear of negative evaluation
Cooley studied the interests of assertiveness trainees in three settings a university counseling center a junior college and a community mental health center
Fear of being assertive in and expressing hurt anger or disappointment to people who are closest to you were ranked of highest concern
Piccinin found these same two areas ranked in the top five assertiveness concerns with a group of seniors
Piccinin McCarrey and Chislett in a study of some twothousand university students found that reported moderate or severe problems with giving or receiving criticism
In a study of college students Frisch Froberg of respondents report handling criticism is a common problem among fellow students
Accordingly the present study investigates outcome gains of a cognitivebehavioral training program which targets cognitions and skills necessary for effective giving and receiving of criticism
Specifically selfreported criticism skills selfesteem and fear of negative evaluation were hypothesized to be greater and lesser respectively after such a training program in comparison to a control group
In addition roleplayed criticism skills were also hypothesized to be greater after training in comparison to the control group
METHOD Subjects
for participation in a criticism skills training program
Inclusion was contingent upon a the subject s designation that heshe had a moderate to a very significant problem givingreceiving criticism b a score of or higher above the sixtysixth percentile on the Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale Watson Friend and c an explicit request to participate in the skills training program
Threehundred subjects were offered the criticism training program
Subjects who completed all facets of the research study received a nominal payment of five dollars
Of the seventyfour subjects who completed all facets were male and were female
The mean age for the males was years and for females was years
The age range for both was seventeen to fortyfive years
DEPENDENT MEASURES SelfReport Measures Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale FNE
The FNE Scale Watson Friend was administered at pretest posttest and oneyear followup
The thirty truefalse items were designed to assess negative evaluation was defined by Watson and Friend as apprehension about others evaluations distress over their negative evaluations avoidance of evaluative situations and the expectations that others would evaluate oneself negatively p 
The fear of negative evaluation is not specific to a testing situation but may be manifest in any social situation for which there is a potential for evaluation
Reliability estimates of the FNE are good
Corcoran and Fischer reported internal consistency of the measure ie itemtotal correlations to be on average and KuderRichardson internal consistency correlations of for a sample of college students and for a separate sample of students
Watson and Friend reported a mean biserial correlation of the FNE items of N indicating a high level of scale homogeneity
The same authors report a productmoment testretest correlation of 
Scores on this scale correlate r and with scores on Crown and Marlowe
Criticism Concerns Scale CCS
The CCS Lemelin Piccinin Chislett McCarrey contains fifteen items designed to assess irrational beliefs concerning the consequences of giving and receiving criticism
The testretest reliability of the CCS with a fourweek interval was 
A Cronbach s alpha of indicated adequate internal reliability for the fifteen CCS items N 
Examples of items include Most people ca nt handle criticism so if I did criticize I would just be making enemies
Nothing gives anybody the right to criticize what somebody else has done
SelfEsteem Criticism Scales
The SelfEsteem Criticism Scale McCarrey Piccinin Chislett contains seven items related to the subjects selfesteem in giving criticism and seven items related to the subjects selfesteem in receiving criticism
Examples of items include With respect to giving criticism my selfesteem is Scales for the items were written in a sevenstep Likerttype scale in a Semantic valuableworthless optimisticpessimistic relaxedtense
Cranbach s alphas were and for the selfesteem giving and receiving scales respectively indicating a high level of internal reliability
Behavioral RolePlay Measure
The Behavioral RolePlay measure consisted of eight standardized roleplay episodes where each participant responded to a situation presented via audiotape that assigned a role to themselves and the confederate prompter
The prompter then initiated the interaction by either actively criticizing or behaving in a way which invited criticism
There were four interactions with a male and four with a female confederate in the set of eight roleplay episodes
Following McFall and Lillesand Galassi Galassi and Bower and Bower the giving and receiving criticism episodes fell into classes involving a peers b authority figures c business transactions and d intimate acquaintances
Respondent behavior was videotaped then scored on sevenstep scales by three judges blind to the purpose of the study
Judges were given eight hours criticism behaviors on the scales
Following Butler Monti Corriveau and Curran and Weisinger and Lobsenz the criteria of effective verbal giving criticism behaviors were a the taking of personal responsibility for the critical feedback eg I feel your radio is loud b specific criticism c erapathetic criticism d clear behavioral change requested d the provision of a balance of positive and negative criticism and f an overall judgment of global effectiveness in giving criticism
The criteria of verbal receiving criticism behaviors were a a clear paraphrase of the criticism you mean you find my radio is too loud b request for precision if needed c position taken I agreedisagree d expressed TOOLONG with reason to change OK here s what I ll do and of nonverbal criticism behaviors were a appropriate eye contact focused attention but not staring b voice tone and inflection wellmodulated versus whispered monotone or shouted indignation c facial expression consistent with verbal content d posture wellbalanced directly facing the other person e verbal fluencyhesitancy speech delivery continuous and wellplaced without speech gaps and awkward pauses and f gestures fluid versus mechanical smooth fluid gestures consistent with the verbal content with the absence of mechanicalabrupt gestures
Alpha coefficient estimates of interjudge consistency in rating the above behaviors ranged from to with the median alpha indicating acceptable interjudge consistency in rating these videotaped criticism behaviors
THE SOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING PROGRAM
The program was of four weeks duration meeting for two and a half hours per week and the training was cognitivebehavioral in nature
Training involved criticism skill acquisition and challenging irrational or selfdefeating cognitions
Each of the five training groups had two leaders one male and one was an experienced mean years professional counselor and the other leader was a senior doctoral student in clinical psychology
Complete details of the training programs are available in the training program manuals Piccinin McCarrey Chislett 
In the absence of leader effects henceforth the participants in the five treatment groups are referred to as the training program group
PROCEDURE
Subjects were randomly assigned to the training program or the control group on a fivetoone ratio
All subjects were given the selfreport measures and participated in the behavioral roleplay at pretest
After completion of the training program or a similar period of time with no training for the control group subjects were given selfreport measures and participated in the behavioral roleplay test
At oneyear followup all subjects were again given the two sets of measures once more

Behavioral RolePlay Intercorrelation and Factor Analysis of the Verbal and Nonverbal Behavior
It will be recalled that there were six nonverbal variables six giving criticism verbal variables and five receiving criticism verbal variables
Intercorrelations were computed within these three sets of variables followed by three factor analyses to determine the extent to which each rated behavior was independent
It was found that within each set of variables nonverbal verbal giving criticism and verbal receiving criticism the correlation of each behavior with the global rating was quite high p 
One main factor emerged from each of the factor analyses
These global factors accounted for an average in excess of percent of the nonverbal verbal giving and verbal receiving variance
Therefore it was decided to use only the three global behavioral ratings in subsequent analyses rather than the seventeen individual variable ratings
Behavioral RolePlay Measures
No significant training program effects DISCUSSION
With respect to fear of negative evaluation both training program and control groups felt less anxious at posttest
Perhaps taking the FNE twice may have relieved some anxiety for both groups and this may mask the effect of the training program in the short term
However at followup the training program group continued to maintain the gains whereas the control group did not
This may indicate a possible consolidation effect of training program on selfreported anxiety stemming from negative regard of others
On the criticism concerns measure the training program subjects reported fewer concerns about givingreceiving criticism over time
However their concerns were only significantly lower than those of the controls at posttest
The differences in the results on the FNE and CCS may be understood in terms of the content of items in the questionnaires
While both scales have items related to giving and receiving criticism the FNE seems to be more concerned with fear stemming from receiving rather than giving criticism and the CCS seems to have more items related to the fear giving of criticism the selfesteem of the training program group continued to improve over time
However it was only significantly higher than the control group at posttest
For selfesteem related to the receiving of criticism we see a consolidation effect similar to FNE results with respect to anticipated fear of negative evaluation
Program impact on selfesteem related to giving criticism was not differential across training program versus control groups in the long term despite initial posttest differences immediately after the program
Inversely program impact on selfesteem receiving was only differential in the longer term despite the absence of differential effect between training program versus control in the shortterm
Giving criticism involves taking initiative the motivational proactive step to practice that skill
The program required the individual to give criticism through roleplays and homework assignments in the real world and then the sharing of these experiences involving giving criticism back in the training group
This may explain the more immediate posttest results
Perhaps individuals did not continue to practice this skill after program completion Participants may not have received enough reinforcement or incentive to continue incurring the costs associated with giving criticism
This may indicate the need for a booster session or some form of followup involving increased incentives to give criticism over the longer term Maddux Norton Stoltenberg 
Individuals need a sufficiently high level of perceived selfefficacy to maintain behaviors Bandura 
If a sense of selfefficacy is not maintained at a minimum level the subject will not maintain the effort to continue giving criticism and to live with the accompanying risk of loss of social approval
It must be noted that these participants all reported rather high levels of fear of negative evaluation
Opportunities to practice skills in receiving criticism after program completion was largely dictated by initiatives of other people and could be more similar for both control and training program subjects
Perhaps the skill development given in the program combined with daily interaction with others provided sufficient opportunities to practice this skill
Another explanation might be that the control subjects used lower the training program subjects who at oneyear followup were comparing their behavior to their own higher standards of successful behavior
Even improved behavior may not meet these higher standards so that selfreported esteem in this area was equivalent across training program and control groups
Participation in the study by individuals in the control group indicated high motivation because these individuals received no training or little obvious reinforcement for participation
Since these individuals were highly motivated they may have been involved in selfhelp programs which resulted in their improved feelings related to giving and receiving criticism
Selfhelp programs could have consisted of selfcontracts which involved accessing material related to giving and receiving criticism and practicing the skills outlined in these materials
The result could be improved selfratings similar to the training program group
No significant differences were found on the behavioral role plays
Scrutiny of roleplay pretest means indicated individuals were already performing fairly well
This suggests program participants did not have a deficit but were rather inhibited by their irrational beliefs and high fear of negative evaluation
efficacious in reducing irrational beliefs in the shortterm and anxietyrelated to fear of negative evaluation in the long term
Similarly selfesteem connected with giving criticism was increased in short term while selfesteem connected with receiving criticism was increased in the long term
The absence of long term effects in the context of selfesteem giving criticism and irrational beliefs suggests the need for booster sessions for this more proactive behavior so that individuals can maintain a sense of selfefficacy
Future work in this area might give attention to individuals having bona fide skills deficit reflected by deficient roleplay pretest scores
For this to happen behavioral roleplay should be added to the selection criteria for programs of this nature

Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold CFFT and the difference between fusion and flicker thresholds were examined in female and three male patients with Primary Degenerative Dementia of the Alzheimer s type PDDAT
The control group consisted of age sex and occupational classmatched normal volunteers
Patients had a mean age of years range diagnosis was based on DSMIIIR criteria
The psychophysical method of limits was used to measure three ascending fusion and three descending flicker means the average being the CFFT
Both the CFFT and the flicker thresholds were able to distinguish between patients and volunteers at a high level of statistical significance t df p and t df p respectively
Sixtyfive percent of patients had CFFT scores below SD of the volunteer CFFT mean and percent of patients had flicker thresholds below SD of the volunteer flicker mean
The fusion thresholds fusion thresholds were significantly greater than the flicker thresholds in patients t df p 
One interpretation of the results in that patients with PDDAT have a significant reduction in the sensitivity of the Central Nervous System to suprathreshold flicker
Accurate diagnosis of early PDDAT probable Alzheimer s disease continues to remain one of the most difficult areas in dementia research
The use of simple quantitative measures such as CFFT may have an important role to play in the overall assessment of patients with PDDAT
INTRODUCTION
The relationship between Primary Degenerative Dementia of the Alzheimer s Type PDDT and normal aging remains a controversial subject
Copeland and Giaquinto have argued that PDDAT and normal aging are separate entities but other workers have argued the opposite URen Brayne Calloway Deary Whalley 
However there is general agreement that the early phase of PDDAT is indistinguishable clinically and neuropsychologically from normal aging of the Alzheimer s type may be a continuum with normal aging but in the early stages the difference is only quantitative URen 
Quantitative measures which are able to distinguish between normal elderly subjects and patients with PDDAT may contribute to the overall clinical and psychiatric assessment of borderline cases particularly if assessed longitudinally
Research techniques which are sensitive to Central Nervous System CNS change with age would have the greatest chance of identifying and quantifying early change in patients with PDDAT
The measurement of Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold CFFT has enjoyed a long tradition in experimental physiology psychology and more recently psychopharmacology Simonson Brozek Smith Misiak Ott Kranda 
It is also well established as a research technique in gerontological research McFarland Warren Karis Coleston Hindmarch Curran 
Its use in psychiatry is relatively recent and has been largely confined to the investigation of antidepressants and antianxiety agents Hindmarch Alford Hindmarch 
Subthreshold intermittent light is perceived as flicker
If the frequency is gradually increased the flicker becomes gradually less distinct until flicker is no longer perceived fusion threshold
Alternatively if the flicker is suprathreshold and is gradually decreased a point is reached when flicker is just perceived flicker threshold
These are variations of the continuous method of limits Woodworth Schlosberg 
The mean of the fusion and flicker thresholds is the CFFT
The Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold can be regarded as a functional measure of the CNS
Cerebral cortical activity can be influenced by flickering light Toman and the electroencephalograph EEG obtained from the occipital cortex has been shown to be synchronous with the frequency of flicker Walker Woolf Halstead Case 
In addition the CFFT has repeatedly been shown to correlate with other objective measures of CNS activity including the EEG Grundstrom Holmberg Holmberg Hansen Grandjean Baschera Martin Weber Gortelmeyer Wieman 
Soininen found that slowing of the occipital rhythm measured by the EEG was the best discriminator between patients and normal elderly subjects
The measurement of CFFT in demented patients has not previously been described with the exception of Tucker 
This was a small open study of eight patients response to Hydergine was monitored by measurement of the CFFT
Although clinical improvement was correlated with an increase in the CFFT patient numbers were small and the diagnosis of dementia lacked rigor no details of diagnostic criteria or assessments were given
The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical diagnostic utility of the CFFT technique in delineating patients with PDDT and control subjects
As far as the authors are aware such a comparison has not previously been reported
This study also examines for the first time the relationship between fusion and flicker thresholds in patients with patients were included in the study
Their age ranged from to with a mean of years years
Twentyfive patients lived in Residential Homes and one patient lived at home cared for by her family
Patients were identified initially by consultation with general practitioners and by examination of case records with the GPs consent
Patients identified as possibly suffering from dementia as defined by McLean received a visit from a screening nurse who administered the Abbreviated Mental TestAMT Hodkinson and the MiniMental State Examination MMSE Folstein Folstein McHugh to assess gross cognitive impairment
Patients scoring seven or less on the AMT andor or less on the MMSE received a diagnostic visit from a physician
Patients satisfying DSMIIIR criteria for PDDAT American Psychiatric Association were more fully evaluated by the study physician under the supervision of a consultant in the psychiatry of old age with a special interest in dementia
Assessments
Assessments included medical assessment of mental state physical examination including neurology neuropsychological assessment routine haematology and biochemistry Thyroid Function Tests plasma Bfolate VDRL serum carotene urinalysis chest xray ECG and CT scan
Patients with evidence of significant physical illness other psychiatric diagnoses including depression the secondary causes of dementia or taking concomitant medications known to have CNS activity were excluded
All patients were rated as mildmoderate American Psychiatric Association by the study physician
The majority were moderately impaired
Volunteers
Twentysix age Coleston Hindmarch and intelligencematched Misiak volunteers were included in the study age range mean years 
Intelligence was indirectly assessed by occupational class Goldthorpe because of the difficulty of premorbid assessment of the patient group
All patients were nonsmokers but two volunteers smoked less than ten cigarettes per day Barlow Baer 
All patients were nondrinkers but four volunteers claimed to drink U
However these volunteers reported that they had drunk no alcohol in the hours prior to testing Hindmarch 
Sex differences have not been systematically studied but were controlled for as a precaution
Where it was not possible to exactly match for occupational class patients were matched with volunteers of lower occupational class six volunteers
Since the CFFT is positively correlated with intelligence Misiak this would decrease the possibility of identifying a difference due to biased matching
Two volunteers were of a higher occupational class than patients but patients were exactly matched for occupational class according to the definitions described by Goldthorpe 
All volunteers lived at home either alone or with their spouse andor family and were identified from two general practices in the Leeds area UK
This was part of a general health screening program coordinated from St James s University Hospital UK
Assessments by the screening nurse and physician included general medical and psychiatric history including concomitant medication and alcohol and assessment of cognitive function using the AMT Hodkinson and MMSE Folstein et al 
All volunteers were judged to be cognitively normal by the study psychologist and those with significant physical or psychiatric illness or receiving concomitant medication with CNS activity were excluded from the study
Materials
All assessments were carried out in patients and volunteers normal surroundings ie homeresidential home
Assessments were made between and hours to control for possible circadian variation Hindmarch 
Other authors have found no effect of time of day Hett Dewar Jones Tiplady 
The CFFT was measured using four red lightemitting diodes in binocular foveal fixation at m using a TOOLONG test apparatus the Leeds Psychomotor Tester Model Number ZAK D
The continuous psychophysical method of limits was used to determine both the fusion and flicker thresholds Woodworth Schlosberg 
Bright direct sunlight and poor ambient illumination were avoided
Provided very little effect on the CFFT Simonson Brozek 
A standardized set of instructions was used to explain the procedure
A relaxed attitude to the test was fostered especially in the demented patients
Results are more reliable if the task is not perceived as a performance test Clark if a relaxed attitude is encouraged Goldstone and if standardized instructions are used Huneke 
In the ascending mode flicker was increased from Hz at HzS
Subjects were required to press a button when flickering appeared to cease
In the descending mode flicker was decreased from Hz at HzS until flicker was just detected
Flicker or fusion was registered by a button press
Initially three alternate fusion and flicker thresholds were determined
This constituted the practice phase
This was repeated in a counterbalanced design with half the subjects starting in the ascending mode and half in the descending mode
visual fatigue
This constituted the test phase
Only the results obtained during the test phase are reported in this study
RESULTS
The raw data is presented graphically in Figures and 
Both the CFFT and the flicker threshold were able to distinguish between patients and normals t df p and t df p respectively see Table 
Sixtyfive percent of patients had CFFT scores below SD of the volunteer CFFT mean and of patients had flicker thresholds below SD of the volunteer flicker mean
The fusion threshold minus the flicker threshold is FuFl
This was measured in both patients and volunteers
The difference between the two groups was not significant
Unequal variances MannWhitney U p 
The fusion thresholds were found to be significantly higher than the flicker thresholds in the patient sample t df p in patients with PDDAT and normal controls was demonstrated t df p 
However the difference between flicker thresholds in the two groups was highly significant t df p 
DISCUSSION
Critical flicker fusion threshold measurement has received considerable attention from psychopharmacologists in recent years but the technique has not been investigated in patients with PDDAT
In a previous study of normal elderly volunteers Curran Wattis Shillingford and Hindmarch demonstrated a tendency of the CFFT to decrease with increasing age but this failed to reach significance
In the same study the difference between fusion and flicker thresholds was found to be negatively and significantly correlated with age
This reduction was due almost entirely to a fall in the flicker thresholds and may reflect a reduction of the CNS to suprathreshold flicker with increasing age
If PDDAT is an exaggeration of the normal aging process one would predict lower CFFT values in demented patients compared This has been clearly demonstrated
One would also predict that the reduction of the flicker thresholds seen in normal elderly subjects with increasing age would be exaggerated further resulting in the fusion thresholds being greater than the flicker thresholds
This has also been clearly demonstrated in demented patients
In normal volunteers the flicker thresholds are greater than the fusion thresholds but with increasing age the flicker thresholds tend to decrease with little or no change in the fusion thresholds Curran et al 
In demented patients this relationship is reversed the fusion thresholds are greater than the flicker thresholds
The CFFT has been clearly demonstrated to be significantly lower in demented patients compared with normal volunteers
It could be accounted for by a specific reduction of the flicker threshold so that the CFFT in the patient group was lower than the volunteer group CFFT
Alternatively both the fusion and flicker thresholds could decrease simultaneously so that the resultant CFFT was lower than the volunteer CFFT
The results from this study clearly demonstrate that group and the volunteer group whereas the flicker thresholds are significantly different in the two groups
The demented patients have significantly lower flicker thresholds than their age sex and occupational classmatched counterparts
The reduction of CFFT scores in demented patients is accounted for by a reduction of flicker scores
One interpretation of this is that in patients with PDDAT there is a large reduction in the sensitivity of the CNS to suprathreshold flicker
This was observed as a trend in normal elderly subjects the degree of reduction in flicker thresholds being greater with increasing age
The influence of increased reaction time in demented patients Pirozzolo Christensen Ogle Hansch Thompson and shift in the response criterion are unlikely to be alternative explanations
One would expect these to influence the flicker and fusion thresholds equally
The results are consistent with PDDAT being an exaggeration of the normal aging process at least as far as sensitivity to suprathreshold flicker is concerned
Measurement of CFFT is a simple and quick technique environment in contrast to other functional measures such as the EEG and Positron Emission Tomography
These are not only considerably more expensive but take more time to complete require skilled personnel and are not available to the vast majority of patients especially those with borderline dementia
Like other neuropsychological and clinical measures there is some overlap with normal elderly subjects
The measurement of CFFT and flicker thresholds may be particularly useful for longitudinal assessment of borderline cases of PDDAT
Under these circumstances the ability of CFFT and flicker thresholds to predict outcome could be evaluated
Choice of units of analysis is a critical problem in evaluating environmental assessment items
The Ecological Fallacy involves interpreting results based on ecological entities such as environmental settings as applying to individuals
A less familiar error the Individual Differences Fallacy involves interpreting results based on individuals as applying to settings
Although this second error has been ubiquitous little is known about the empirical consequences of using different units of analysis in item analysis
This study examined this issue when the units were individuals observed settings or artificial or random settings
Neither item validities based on individuals nor item validities based on settings yielded unequivocal results
However a measure developed specifically for environmental research the SplitSample Correlation appeared useful for identifying environmental items
Researchers constructing environmental assessment scales should select items with both high SplitSample Correlations and high settinglevel item validities
The ecological perspective in psychology Barker Bronfenbrenner Stern Willems assumes that the attributes of environmental settings influence or indeed constrain or determine a wide variety of cognitive affective and behavioral responses
Consequently researchers from this perspective have explored a number of approaches to assessing the characteristics of environmental settings Astin Holland Barker Craik Feimer Holland Moos Pace Richards Stern 
Such environmental assessments involve a number of relatively unique psychometric problems Craik Feimer Pace 
The present study addresses one such problem the choice of proper units of analysis
For many years behavioral scientists have been aware of the Ecological Fallacy Robinson the error of interpreting variation among ecological units such as environmental settings as though it applied to variation among individuals
It is equally erroneous however to interpret variation among Pace Richards 
A recent theoretical paper Richards suggested this error which has been ubiquitous in previous research on environments Gottfredson Hybl Gottfredson Casteneda be labelled the Individual Differences Fallacy
A common approach to the construction of environmental assessment scales is to use questions about the environment that are similar to the questions typically used in objective personality tests Pace Stern Moos 
The Individual Difference Fallacy is likely to be an especially serious problem for such scales because the items could function as a disguised measure of personality or other psychological characteristics of individuals rather than a true environmental measure
Accordingly Richards used hypothetical data to argue that no analysis using individuals as the units is capable of distinguishing between a valid environmental measure and a disguised test of personality
Only analyses using environmental settings as the units could make this distinction
An empirical study Richards confirmed these theoretical findings but revealed additional complexities
The data were based on individuals in environmental settings classrooms who responded to six environmental scales
Data also were sorted randomly into artificial settings of the same size as the observed settings
These random settings approximate a situation in which the scales are a pure disguised test of personality
In addition to individual and setting level Alphas the scale reliabilities were assessed by a special index Richards the SplitSample Correlation that is designed specifically to address the unique problems of environmental measurement
The SplitSample Correlation is an analog of a splithalf test reliability based on odd items vs even items
To compute one assigns numbers from to n to the individuals within each setting and computes two summary scores for that setting one based on individuals assigned odd numbers and the other on individuals assigned even numbers then summary scores are correlated across environmental settings
Alpha coefficients based on individuals as the units of analysis necessarily from observed or random settings confirming that no individual level analysis can throw any light at all on the setting level reliability of environmental assessment scales
The setting level Alphas for observed settings were quite substantial but so were the Alphas for random settings
Thus a standard reliability analysis with settings as the units also may not distinguish clearly between a valid environmental measure and a disguised measure of personality
The SplitSample Correlations however were high for observed settings but low for random settings
Thus only an index developed specifically for environmental research yielded unequivocal results
The present paper extends these arguments to the context of item statistics and item analysis
The analyses reported here emphasize a traditional index of item validity the adjusted partwhole correlation
However the same points would apply to item characteristic curves in the context of item response theory Lord 
METHOD
Sample of Individuals and Settings
The data for this study like the data for the scale reliability study Richards reducing disorderly behavior in Charleston South Carolina Middle ie Junior High Schools Gottfredson Gottfredson Karweit Gottfredson 
Specifically the analyses for this study are based on separate assessments of classrooms the environmental settings by Middle School students the individuals
Although some students may have assessed more than one classroom the sets of individuals assessing the various classrooms were essentially independent
Only classrooms with at least respondents were deemed eligible for this study
The number of respondents within classrooms varied from to with a mean of a standard deviation of and a median of 
The numbers for both individual assessments and for environmental settings are large enough to provide highly stable estimates of item statistics
Environmental Assessment Items
Analyses were based on student responses to abbreviated fouritem versions of six of the Classroom Environment Scales developed by Moos Trickett 
Therefore the total number of items was 
Moos and consist of truefalse questions about the characteristics of the classroom
The following specific scales were included Involvement Affiliation Teacher Support Task Orientation Order and Organization Rule Clarity
Units of Analysis
The psychometric properties of the items in these six scales were examined for three different units of analysis
First individuals ie the student assessments were used as the units of analysis
For this analysis each item was scored or with being assigned to the response associated with higher standing on the characteristic implied by the scale title
Second observed environmental settings ie the classrooms were used as the units of analysis
The summary score for each observed setting or classroom or each item was the mean of the item scores for students in that classroom
Because the item scores were scored or these setting summary scores can be interpreted as the probability that an individual in that setting would respond artificial or randomized settings were used as units of analysis
These settings were constructed by sorting the individual assessments into a random order and then dividing them into groups with the same numbers of subjects as the observed classrooms
The summary score for each artificial setting on each item was the mean of the item scores for individuals randomly assigned to it
Statistical Analysis
The first step in the statistical analysis was to compute the adjusted partwhole correlation coefficient or item validity between each item and total score on the scale of which it was a part
The adjustment eliminated the contribution of the item itself to the total score so each adjusted correlation is mathematically equivalent to the zeroorder correlation between the item in question and the total of the other three items in its scale
Therefore statistical tests for zero order correlations were applied to these coefficients
The reliability procedures included in the SPSSX statistical package SPSS were used in computing these correlations
In addition the SplitSample Correlation Richards was computed for each item
SplitSample Correlations for items directly address the central issue of whether or not different individuals agree about the characteristics of given settings on given items
RESULTS
Table summarizes the statistics for individual items
Because the numbers of individuals and settings were relatively large even rather small correlations were nominally significant
Accordingly the absolute magnitude of the various statistics appeared more relevant than their significance level and Table summarizes the central tendency and dispersion of the various statistics across the items
The mean in Table for each statistic except the SplitSample Correlation for random settings would be significant beyond the level if it were a zeroorder correlation based on the numbers of individuals and settings for this study
The average adjusted partwhole correlation for individuals was typical for item analysis research but necessarily was identical whether the individuals came from the observed settings or from the random settings
This fact provides confirmation that item analyses using individuals items measuring the characteristics of settings and items measuring the characteristics of individuals
The average partwhole correlation for observed settings was both fairly high and somewhat higher than the individual level correlation
At first glance this result would seem to indicate that to some degree these items were measuring the characteristics of settings
Surprisingly however the average partwhole item correlation for random settings also was fairly high and of approximately the same magnitude as the correlation for individuals
It is unclear why this was the case for theoretically this correlation should be close to zero Richards F tests at the scale level confirmed the adequacy of the randomization Richards 
One possible explanation is that randomization does not absolutely equate settings but merely insures that only chance differences persist
Therefore the correlation for random settings will approximate the correlation for randomly chosen individuals
Whatever the explanation these results clearly indicate that setting level partwhole correlations also can not distinguish unequivocally between items measuring setting characteristics and items measuring settings was fairly substantial however a clear indication that to some degree these items were measuring setting characteristics
More important the average SplitSample Correlation for random settings was low
Thus the SplitSample Correlation which was designed specifically for environmental measures appeared capable of distinguishing items which at least in part were measuring setting characteristics from items measuring only individual differences
At the same time both theoretical considerations Richards and the typical properties of ecological correlations Robinson suggest that the SplitSample Correlations for items that are measuring only setting characteristics should be higher than the Correlations obtained in this study
Indeed the SplitSample Correlation should be for a pure environmental item with no measurement error Richards 
The relatively low value obtained here suggests that while these items were to a degree measuring the characteristics of settings to an equal or larger degree they were measuring the characteristics of individuals
This conclusion is supported by the results obtained previously at
The results confirm the results of an earlier study of scale reliabilities Richards and suggest that substantial changes are needed in the itemselection procedures typically used to construct environmental assessment scales
The typical procedure has been to select items on the basis of item statistics for individuals frequently individuals within a single setting
This procedure not only is incapable of identifying items that measure the characteristics of environmental settings but also is virtually guaranteed to select items that largely or entirely measure individual differences
Therefore item analyses based on individuals should be eschewed in future environmental research even as a first step and reports based on such analyses should no longer be welcome in scientific journals
Even in the initial stages of scale construction environmental settings should be the units of analysis in computing item statistics including item characteristic curves
Moreover the number of settings must be relatively large perhaps as large as the minimum number of individuals needed for a conventional item analysis
Thus future research aimed at more complex and more expensive than has been customary
Consequently such research will be more difficult
This greater difficulty appears to be the necessary price of obtaining scales that measure environmental characteristics however and researchers should not allow such difficulty to deter them from using the proper units of analysis
It will not be sufficient however simply to select items on the basis of adjusted partwhole correlations with environmental settings as the units of analysis
Such correlations will be substantial for items that measure environmental characteristics but they also can be substantial for items that reflect only individual differences
The itemlevel SplitSample Correlation is needed to distinguish between these two kinds of items
In constructing environmental scales therefore researchers should select items that have both a high setting level partwhole correlation and a high SplitSample Correlation preferably higher than the SplitSample Correlations obtained here
Because items have never been selected in this way no information currently is available that would guide researchers in constructing such items
As experience accumulates with possible to identify in advance the type of items most likely to meet both selection criteria
It then would become easier to construct environmental assessment scales that minimize individual differences contamination
This study sought to determine whether or not a disease prevention program might have a negative impact on attitudes towards disease victims
Knowledge of and attitudes towards AIDS and several other serious diseases were assessed before and after college students viewed a filmed educational program on AIDS
Results showed that compared to a control group participants who had seen the AIDS film reported significantly greater fear and dislike of a hypothetical AIDS patient
The film also significantly enhanced participants perceptions that AIDS is a preventable disease
Results are discussed in terms of the possibility that healtheducation programs emphasizing preventability may inadvertently increase peoples tendency to blame the victim
Diseaseprevention programs are designed to inform people about the causes and course of a disease motivate them to adopt diseaseprevention behaviors and teach them prevention skills Somers 
The question of whether or not such programs also alter reactions towards victims of the disease is generally not addressed when programs are evaluated
From the standpoint of disease sufferers this may be an adverse impact on societal attitudes towards victims can such an effect reduce the quality of social support they receive
A substantial literature attests to the fact that the social environment in general and social support in particular can influence personal health
The protective effects of social support have been demonstrated for several health outcomes including mortality and the development of chronic diseases Broadhead et al 
Social support has also been found to play an important role in a person s ability to cope with and survive cancer Bloom Funch Marshall Lichtman Taylor heart disease Mallick Ruberman Weinblatt Goldberg Chaudhary diabetes Heitzman Kaplan as well as other diseases see DiMatteo Hays Dimond Maybury Brewin 
Given the potential impact that social support has on one s ability to cope with a serious illness it to a reduction in that support
Attitudes towards the victims of disease comprise one such factor in that if one holds a negative attitude toward sufferers of a particular disease that negativity will probably color hisher interactions with the sufferer
Those with a serious illness often find negative social reactions to be as difficult to cope with as the illness itself Wortman DunkelSchetter 
Diseaseprevention programs which by their very nature seek to instill in the audience a sense of control and responsibility may unintentionally produce a negative shift in attitudes towards disease victims
By increasing beliefs that most of the responsibility for diseaseprevention rests with the individual such programs might increase one s tendency to blame and derogate the victims of disease
One might infer a character flaw to exist in a person who could have acted to prevent a serious disease yet failed to do so
In fact previous studies have shown that victims of preventable diseases receive more derogation than victims of unpreventable ones Katz Hass Parisi Gruman 
The present study sought to explore the hypothesis that a health education program which emphasizes the preventability of a disease may increase peoples negative evaluation of a person suffering from that disease
Specifically participants evaluated an AIDS victim before and after viewing a popular madeforTV AIDS education program
METHOD Participants
Thirtynine university undergraduates females and males with an average age of years participated in this study for which they earned extra course credit
Procedures
Participants who agreed to take part in what was described as a study of health attitudes were asked to read a one page interview in which a person with AIDS disclosed personal feelings about having the disease see Table for excerpt
After reading the interview participants were asked to record their impression of the AIDS patient on an impression rating scale IRS
Participants also reported their beliefs about AIDS and several other diseases on the Health Beliefs Questionnaire HBQ a scale designed by the authors for us week after completing these questionnaires half of the participants watched an AIDS education film produced for the Home Box Office cable television network and narrated by former US Surgeon General C Everett Koop
The film answered common questions concerning the transmission of AIDS and emphasized the steps one should follow to prevent contracting AIDS
Following the film participants who viewed the film as well as those in the control group again completed the IRS and HBQ
Each phase of the study was presented to participants as a separate investigation in the hope that participants would remain unaware of the experimenters hypotheses
The fact that several of the questionnaires dealt with a broad spectrum of diseases helped to make the separate studies cover study plausible
Questionnaires
The impression rating scale IRS asked participants to indicate how much they liked enjoyed feared would avoid were made to feel uncomfortable or awkward by feel saddened or embarrassed by etc the stimulus person
In addition they rated the stimulus person s psychological
Each dimension was rated on a fivepoint Likerttype scale where not at all and extremely
""
The Health Beliefs Questionnaire HBQ was designed to assess a person s perception of the preventability prognosis contagiousness social cost and economic cost of a variety of diseases eg AIDS cancer diabetes heart disease etc
""
For example one item asks How preventable is AIDS That is to what extent can individuals take actions exercise diet avoiding certain activitieschemical agents etc that will keep them from getting the disease The same question was asked for ten other diseases
Participants rated each item using a fivepoint Likerttype scale where no or not at all and almost always or extremely
RESULTS
Results of a principal components factor analysis with a varimax rotation were used to combine several of the items on the IRS into an index
Specifically inspiring kind friendly enjoyable or interesting the AIDS patient was along with six items reflecting the participants desire to help support and be with the patient loaded at or higher on a factor accounting for of the total IRS variance
All thirteen of these were summed to form an overall positivity rating
In this way a positivity rating for both pre and postfilm was obtained for both groups
Several items on the IRS with particular relevance to the hypothesis eg how afraid the patient made you feel how much you would tend to avoid the patient were analyzed separately
The only HBQ item included in the analyses was one assessing the perceived preventability of AIDS
Change scores were obtained for all dependent variables of interest by subtracting the postfilm scores from prefilm scores
These change scores were analyzed in a series of oneway ANOVAs see Table 
Film viewers as compared to the control group rated the AIDS patient less p 
Those who saw the AIDS film also reported feeling more afraid of the AIDS patient than the control group F p 
Finally the film had the desired effect of making viewers feel that AIDS was a preventable disease
Those who saw the film compared to those who did not perceived AIDS as being significantly more preventable at posttesting F p 
DISCUSSION
Findings in this study support the notion that diseaseprevention programs may inadvertently do a disservice to the victims of disease
Specifically while the film had the intended effect of making participants view AIDS as more preventable it also increased their tendency to fear and derogate a victim of AIDS
While the findings suggest that it may be the perception of AIDS preventability that mediates the derogation of the victim no direct test of this was made in the current study
Additional research is needed to determine which facets of diseaseprevention programs may have the
It is also interesting to note that those who did not see the film felt substantially more positive towards the AIDS patient at the posttest period suggesting that in the absence of the film information repeated exposure increased rather than decreased positive feelings
Since social support may enhance a person s ability to cope with and survive a serious illness and since such support may depend on societal attitudes towards disease victims the implications of these results are grave indeed
However several cautions are warranted in interpreting these findings
First one must keep in mind that participants reacted to a hypothetical AIDS patient
Future research might explore the generalizability of these findings to the evaluation of real AIDS patients
Second because the study was limited to a small sample of undergraduate students the results may not be representative of the general population
Further tests with more diverse groups are necessary before undue confidence is placed in these findings
Finally only one diseaseprevention program and one disease was tested
represent a general phenomenon or one that is idiosyncratic in nature a variety of diseases and programs should be evaluated
Despite its limitations the study should alert those responsible for designing healtheducation programs that their best intentions may sometimes go awry
While such programs may be successful in protecting healthy individuals they may also have the undesirable consequence of increasing the burden of coping for those who suffer
The frequency with which verbal uncertainty expressions are employed suggests that they play an important role in the communication of states of uncertainty and may have an important role in emerging technologies such as Expert Systems
This article critically reviews empirical studies of verbal uncertainty expressions spanning two decades of research between and with the principal conclusions that People are highly internally consistent in their use of verbal uncertainty expressions No conclusions about betweensubject variability are justified principally because a there is currently no consensus as to what is to count as consistent or inconsistent use and b there are several factors that confound purported analyses of betweensubject consistency such as the composition of the stimulus set and the scaling tasks themselves One study suggests that assessments of the meaning of verbal uncertainty expressions may be conditioned by the prior perceived probabilities of the events they describe
However other interpretations of this study are open
The review also discusses the more general epistemological question of whether is really amenable to the unidimensional framework within which empirical studies have been conceived
One of the most salient features of uncertainty is that people including experts in many fields frequently communicate aspects or degrees of uncertainty by the use of verbal expressions such as possible probable likely very likely highly likely and so on
The following abstracts from the protocol of a medical expert diagnosing abnormalities of the cardiovascular system provide an illustration of the use of such expressions for denoting both absolute and relative states of uncertainty
There is also an unusual shadow seen in the right side representing very likely an anomalously coursing pulmonary vein A diagnosis outside of total anomalous connection is unlikely even though the AV canal is a remote possibility This pulse rate is highly unlikely if that patient had congestive heart failure It s unlikely that this is a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection below the diaphram to the inferior vena cava as is seen with the total anomalous connection to the portal venous system This is most likely a prominent tricuspid closure sound suggesting the possibility of right ventricular hypertension The second hunch is an atrial septal defect of the primum type with a small righttoleft shunt which is either due to an anomaly to the AV canal or even less likely due to pulmonary vascular disease My hunches at this point are a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection either to the vertical vein or to the azygous vein
Much less likely is a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection to the inferior vena cava with Scimitar syndrome Johnson et al emphasis added
Uncertainty has been highlighted by a number of expert systems that have employed verbal uncertainty expressions to communicate aspects or degrees of belief to the user Fox et al van Melle Bonissone et al 
With the exception of Fox a these treat verbal uncertainty expressions either as probability values probability ranges fuzzy probability Bonissone et al for example communicates uncertainty to the user using sets of linguistic uncertainty terms defined as trapezoidal highly regular fuzzy membership functions on the unit probability interval
One such set based on the results of BeythMaron and the associated fuzzy parameters is shown in Table 
In the context of decision technologies such as Expert Systems the frequency and naturalness of verbal uncertainty expressions suggests that they may provide a graceful interface for communicating uncertainty to system users
However the question of their appropriateness in interface design is dependent upon a clear account of their use particularly factors such as withinsubject variability betweensubject variability and context specificity of meaning
If people are not internally consistent in the meanings they assign to verbal uncertainty expressions or if betweensubject variability is high at the appropriate level of resolution then attempts to incorporate verbal uncertainty expressions into an interface will be unsuccessful
Moreover if the meaning of verbal uncertainty terms is found to be dependent upon contextual knowledge and a model of how it affects the meaning of verbal uncertainty expressions to use them appropriately
Finally if verbal uncertainty expressions are to be modelled as probability values ranges or fuzzy subsets of the unit probability interval then it must be established that the semantics of the expressions employed permit unidimensional mapping
Treating nonunidimensional objects as unidimensional would force them into a semantic straight jacket that may both ignore the richness of the information they convey and lead to communication error
In short a comprehensive account of the use of verbal uncertainty expressions is a prerequisite for successful application in expert systems and other technologies
Review of Experimental Studies
Many experimental studies have investigated the use of verbal uncertainty expressions using a number of direct and indirect scaling procedures
The principal areas of investigation have been between and withinsubject variability and context dependency
These and the issue of semantics or unidimensionality are the focus of the following review which describes and critically assesses the methodology and interpretation of eleven papers spanning NEWMAN 
Lichtenstein and Newman had subjects assign numerical values between to to verbal expressions Table 
These results lead the authors to three observations Firstly the degree of qualification of adverbial modifiers was symmetrical between likely and unlikely
The order was very quite no adverb rather fairly somewhat Secondly subadditivity was observed between the mean values assigned to of the sets of symmetric pairs where a symmetric pair is defined as an expression and its affixal negation eg the mean value assigned to quite likely was while the mean value assigned to quite unlikely was making a total of 
Finally with the exception of the expression tossup the range of subjects assignments was greater for expressions nearer the center of the distribution than the extremes
Results were also interpreted as given
Assessment
The principal limitation of this study was the choice of stimuli Many of the expressions have a distinctly frequentistic rather than uncertaintybased meaning eg usually rare seldom and slightly moreless than half the time
Moreover expressions such as fair chance and good chance appear to confound measures of uncertainty with other situational features ie may be a good chance when the prior probability is low or the outcome favorable but a poor chance if the prior is high or the outcome undesirable
Finally it is questionable whether expressions such as inconclusive can be given a unidimensional interpretation and the adverb rather in isolation is ambiguous
JOHNSON 
Johnson investigated the effects of context and group membership on direct estimates for verbal uncertainty expressions Table 
Subjects were either college students or image interpreters in the US Army
The expressions were factorially combined with three contexts relating to the satellite photographs and presented in a item booklet
Analysis of variance showed no significant effects for subject group or context demonstrating that individuals were consistent in their assignments across contexts though possibly because of memory of prior assignments or simple replication
The mean standard deviation of assignments across subjects computed across phrases was 
This accounted for of the total variance while differences between phrases accounted for over suggesting that the former are trivial relative to the latter
On the basis of these results Johnson asserted that Personnel involved in the production and use of intelligence should be extremely wary of attempting to infer values from qualitative expressions of uncertainty p vi
However this does not seem to follow from the data he presents
BRYANT AND NORMAN 
Bryant and Norman had physicians estimate the likelihood of disease given that it was denoted by each of expressions Table on two occasions by selecting a probability value from Correlation of estimates between the two administrations was high r indicating low withinsubject variability
In general however betweensubject ranges were found to be high and only nine expressions had ranges of less than 
Two expressions never and effectively excludes had ranges greater than with bimodal distributions of assignments indicating either ambiguity in their meaning or measurement error
This resulted in never having a higher mean than some expressions clearly less qualifying ie doubtful and unlikely
Assessment
With the exception of low withinsubject variability it is difficult to draw unequivocal conclusions from this study primarily because many of the terms do not relate directly to uncertainty reflecting either logical relations is consistent with is compatible with effectively excludes can not be excluded frequentistic considerations never always sometimes virtually always utility pathognomonic classic normally
Assigning probabilities to essentially nonprobabilistic expressions will result in high variability between assignments or more generally attempting to scale stimuli on nonstimuli dimensions will lead to large variability in the values recorded
Finally range statistics can not be used to measure intersubject variability because they are affected by artefacts such as the presence of outliers and measurement error ranges say little about the average differences between individuals
REYNA 
Reyna investigated the scaling properties of modal quantifiers Table and affixal impossible uncertain etc and lexical not possible not certain etc negations using three scaling tasks unconstrained sorting ranking and direct estimation to determine the subjective dimensionality of this set of expressions and the specific effects of the two types of negation in two studies Results of a first study were replicated and extended in a second study consequently the former study sentences of the form It is X it will happen printed on pieces of card where X was constituted by one of the experimental expressions
The subjects first sorted the set of sentences into an unconstrained number of groups based on similarity and then ranked them according to the degree that it will happen was true
Finally the following day subjects assigned percentage probabilities to each phrase
The incidence matrix derived from the sorting data was analyzed using the Multidimensional Scaling Program TORSCA
This produced a dimensional solution with a normalized stress value of 
The order of expressions along this dimension correlated well with both the median positions in the ranking task Spearman s r p and median assigned probability Spearman s r p 
These were also highly intercorrelated Spearman s r p see Table 
For the probability assignment data there were significant rank correlations between affirmative expressions p and lexical negations Spearman s r p 
Affixal negations however were typically assigned lower values in the probability assignment task than were the corresponding lexical negations though the mean difference between median values was small 
For the partition data no such pattern emerged
Therefore this difference can not be described as reliable
Reyna interpreted these results as indicating firstly that modal adjectives are internally represented in terms of degrees along a unidimensional scale of quantification p secondly that the effect of negation is subtractive rather than multiplicative and thirdly that affixal negation is more qualifying than lexical negation
As suggested above evidence for the latter conclusion is weak
It is also interesting to note that the similarity between affixal and lexical negations suggested by Reyna s data is very different from that envisaged by Zadeh 
He sees the two types of negation as having very different not likely is minus the membership function for likely while the membership function for unlikely is the reflection of the membership function of likely in the line p 
Assessment
Reyna s conclusions are open to question on both methodological and theoretical grounds
Methodologically the use of incidence as a measure of cooccurrence is open to criticism as it ignores much of the information available in the partition and other measures have been shown to produce better solutions Burton Coxon Jones Coxon 
From a theoretical perspective correlation of dimension positions and median probability estimates does not demonstrate conclusively that uncertainty as manifested by the expressions employed in this study is cognitively represented as a unidimensional scale since the same factors may underlie performance in each scaling task
It is true that a unidimensionality hypothesis would predict the obtained results but it is also clear that these can equally well be interpreted as showing that the cognitive processes underlying the various Finally as Budescu and Wallsten point out Reyna gives no indication of the proportion of individual subjects whose rankings conformed to the pattern of group medians
They found that the mean intrasubject correlation between ranks for affirmative and negative expressions was only somewhat questioning Rayna s subtractive proposal
BEYTHMAROM 
BeythMarom set out to assess the importance of contextual information to the meaning of verbal uncertainty expressions by comparing the probability assignments of Israeli political forecasters in three tasks
In the first task subjects assigned numerical values to each of expressions
In the second task they first ranked the expressions into an unconstrained number of categories and then assigned a probability to each category
In the third task subjects assigned percentage probabilities to a subset of the expressions as they appeared in official publications of their host organization
An example of the latter was The outbreak of hostile activities is most probable
""
The first two tasks were classified as context
A number of spacing activities were administered between tasks for temporal separation
The expressions employed in this study translated from Hebrew by BeythMarom are ranked according to mean assignment in Table 
In the undefined context conditions all withinsubject differences between assignments in both tasks were less than 
With respect to betweensubject variability the mean interquartile range IQR of subjects assignments for the expressions was and the mean range was 
The range in the in context task was found to be higher for all expressions with the exception of likely in the undefined context tasks
BeythMarom interpreted these results as showing low withinsubject variability but high betweensubject variability
That is There is considerable disagreement in the interpretation of most verbal probability expressions as evidenced by the large range of numbers given to each expression p and The reported results should convince any forecasting organisation to change its policy and to use p 
It was also suggested that subjects assignments could be roughly partitioned into seven categories as shown in Table though this partition is rather ad hoc
The results of this study were employed by Bonissone et al
 in the development of RUM described above
Assessment
There are a number of caveats to interpretation of data from the in context task
Firstly as BeythMarom points out subjects deep involvement with the events described may have encouraged personal assessments of the probabilities of the events themselves rather than the independent meanings of the uncertainty expressions
Since assessments of the likelihood of the events will vary the effect would be to increase the apparent variability of the values assigned
Personal assessments may in turn be influenced by a host of other factors such as perceived desirability Slovic 
Secondly events may not have been clearly defined
In the example above hostile activities is ambiguous
Both might be construed as hostile activities though their prior probabilities are clearly different
If subjects use perceptions of priors to condition their judgments then different interpretations of the nature of the event itself will have the effect of increasing the apparent range of assigned probabilities
These factors confound measurement of variability of the numerical estimates in the in context task making comparison with ranges for the other tasks unreliable
A final methodological point is that too much store is put upon the range as a measure of dispersion among subjects
The appendix shows that assuming BeythMarom s data is approximately normally distributed an assumption supported by the data appendix the average disparity between numerical assignments for a given expression for any pair of speakers will be close to the IQR standard deviations
For normally distributed data this is about half the range
Thus the range overestimates the average disparity that would occur between any pair of speakers
With respect to the stimulus one must consider one ca nt rule it out entirely and not inevitable indicate a nonzero probability but little else
If this is the case then unidimensional scaling will lead to large range estimates for these expressions
Other stimulus expressions are also problematic it is arguable that meaningful chance connotes aspects of value and expectation rather than just uncertainty and comparative expressions such as most likely can not validly be assigned absolute probabilities
In a large set of mutually exclusive hypotheses the most likely hypothesis may be unlikely
Finally expressions such as one should assume and reasonable to assume say little about the degree of confidence of the event described
Making assumptions is a radically different way of dealing with uncertainty than is propagating probabilities Cohen 
As with other nonunidimensional stimuli unidimensional scaling will lead to large variances in the values assigned
ZIMMER 
Zimmer compared the use of numerical and verbal estimates of uncertainty the cognitive representation of the expected frequency of uncertain events is coded in a verbal propositional mode
This he claims means that requiring people to give numerical estimates of uncertainty will interfere with the native representation more than would the provision of verbal estimates
Thus Human subjects are more effective at reasoning with verbal expressions than with numerical expressions even if the tasks performed rely on frequency information Zimmer p 
To directly compare verbal and numerical estimates of uncertainty it is necessary either to measure the two on some external criterion or to provide some direct mapping between the two
For the purpose of comparison Zimmer treated the verbal uncertainty terms as possibility functions on the unit probability interval and operationalized the specific meaning of each expression as the median point within each possibility function
In his studies subjects first generated a scale of verbal uncertainty expressions in an unspecified task
Next idealized noiseless trapezoidal possibility functions were determined using a modified RobbinsMonro whose proportions varied between and Zimmer p 
Finally median values of these distributions were computed
The mean number of expressions produced was 
A scale elicited in this manner is presented in Table 
The scales were highly discrete and an incomplete range 
Scale values such as these were employed in three studies a calibration study Study I a Bayesian revision study Study II and an applied prediction study Study III
Study I
In the first study Zimmer had West German soldiers give verbal estimates of confidence to each of their answers in a item open response political science questionnaire
Plotting accuracy as a function of confidence ie the numerical values associated with the verbal expressions produced a set of points that clustered around the identity line implying that subjects were well calibrated see chapter 
This contrasts with the large number of studies employing numerical confidence measures that have shown overconfidence There are several problems with this study
Firstly it was not adequately controlled eg there was no numerical group making betweenstudy comparison dubious
Secondly results may be an artefact of the limited range of the scale
In the above scale for example the maximum possible confidence would be this severely constrains the degree of overconfidence possible
Indeed it has been shown that a large proportion of the overconfidence typically observed in calibration studies derives from trials on which subjects assert confidence in their answerspredictions Fischhoff and MacGregor Keren 
Study II
In a second study Zimmer employed a Bayesian revision task similar to the book bag and poker chip experiments carried out by Phillips and Edwards 
In these experiments subjects are required to estimate the probability that a particular book bag of poker chips was being sampled given information concerning the number of possible book bags base rates the color composition of the poker chips in each bag s subjects had a similar task but employed verbal uncertainty expressions to denote their probabilities
In contrast to the finding of conservativism by Phillips and Edwards Zimmer found that subjects who employed verbal expressions were less conservative accuracy ratio varies between and after trial than subjects in other studies who employed numerical expressions accuracy ratio varies between and 
On the basis of this Zimmer concluded that The so called conservativism in information processing is mainly due to a conservative handling of numbers and computation and is not necessarily due to a biased processing procedure Zimmer p 
Assessment
Apart from the lack of a control group the principal problem with this study is the discrete nature of the response scales combined with task demands to adjust responses as information is accumulated
This suggests that Zimmer s subjects giving verbal estimates were forced to adjust their estimates in greater step sizes than would subjects using a continuous numerical response mode giving the impression of utilizing
As an illustration the scale provided by Zimmer Table has a mean interval of 
If subjects employing this scale adjust their estimate after each successive datum the mean change will be 
Subjects using a continuous numerical scale might likewise adjust but in smaller steps
This would result in subjects in the verbal condition being less conservative
Thus the apparent reduction in conservativism may be an artefact of the highly discrete nature of the numerical scale to which the verbal expressions are transformed rather than some facilitation of cognitive processing
It should also be noted that Zimmer makes the error of miscomparing results from the Phillips and Edwards study with his own data
Phillips and Edwards plot likelihood ratio as a function of favorable minus unfavorable samples Zimmer however plots likelihood ratio as a function of trial
This confounds comparison between the studies
Study III
In a third study bank clerks were asked to predict the exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Deutschmark four weeks later
Twelve they would talk to a client whereas the others were asked to give numerical estimates in terms of percentage of change
The first group was found to be more correct and more internally consistent though Zimmer does not report the precise measure used
Analysis of verbal protocols showed that whereas the numerical group relied on variables that are usually stated numerically eg GNP in deriving its predictions the verbal group employed both these and qualitative variables such as the stability of the German government suggesting that the superior performance of the verbal group was caused by its use of a broader knowledge base
The paucity of experimental information provided makes it difficult to discuss methodological aspects of this experiment
General Discussion
On theoretical grounds Zimmer s explanation of the putative improvement in performance as a result of employing verbal uncertainty expressions is weak
In particular research has shown that the critical factor affecting quality of calibration is quantity of experience with immediate feedback on the relevant task Keren mental model of the task and the development of welltuned procedures for generating uncertainty estimates
It is difficult to envisage how elicitation of verbal responses in isolation might produce a similar effect
Similarly in the Bayesian revision task it is difficult to envisage how employing a verbal response scale per se might induce normative behavior in a task for which extensive numerical calculation of conditional probabilities would be required for normative performance
Likewise for the third experiment why should the requirement to give a percentage estimate cause subjects to sample a smaller knowledge base BUDESCU AND WALLSTEN 
The aim of the study conducted by Budescu and Wallsten was to determine whether apparent betweensubject differences in the rank ordering of verbal uncertainty terms are the result of withinsubject variability
That is do the observed differences really derive from individual differences or are they just the effect of taking a crosssection of individual variability over time
Thirtytwo subjects rank ordered and made pair comparisons between expressions Table which were higher than chance H or lower than chance L
The total number of pair comparisons made by each subject was reduced by separating the expressions into two sublists each of consisting of the anchor higher than chance and lower than chance expressions and then excluding the more distant comparisons ie between H and L expressions between always and L expressions between never and H expressions and between never and always
No symmetric expressions eg likely and unlikely appeared in the same list
The study consisted of three replications separated by intervals of three weeks
Each replication was composed of a pair comparison task and either a ranking or an estimation task
The pair comparison task was identical on all three occasions half the subjects receiving each sublist
For the rankingestimation task subjects were required in replication to rank the expressions in ascending order in and in replication to provide both a best numerical estimate of the probability represented by the expression and lower and upper limits of this value
For analysis probability values and the midpoint of the lower and upper bounds were converted to ranks
This produced a total of four rank orders for each subject
A comparison of mean ranks from the ranking tasks and ranks inferred from the pair comparison task showed high agreement though with a few inversions
A x ie subjects x rank orders analysis of variance was performed on ranks separately for each expression
The results indicated that the betweensubject variance was the dominant factor for all expressions
The median proportion of variance accounted for being for the betweensubject factor compared with for the withinsubject factor
The betweensubject variance was significant for all words except uncommon
Similar results were found for the pair comparison data interpreted as showing that betweensubject differences in the ranking of verbal uncertainty expressions is not an artefact of withinsubject meanings of the anchor terms always tossup and never were highly consistent across subjects for each rank IOR 
On the basis of their results Budescu and Wallsten argued that
The practical implications of the present results are quite clear probability phrases may lead to ordinal confusion in usual communication
Furthermore it must be true that use of numbers rather than phrases will eliminate this particular problem
Assessment
This study provides a stronger assessment of the reliability of withinsubject variability by its use of a week gap between sessions though memory of preceding replications can not be ruled out
Like some of the other studies reviewed here however a large set of the expressions employed were distinctly frequentistic rather than probabilistic eg always never often frequently seldom rarely usually and usually not
This may increase betweensubject variance in both ranking constitute a homogeneous set
Betweensubject variance will be further increased by the presence of the expressions predictable unpredictable common and uncommon in the stimulus set
In terms of betweensubject variability the significance of ordinal confusions is overstated
Rank inversions do not necessitate confusions because of synonymity and resolution level
For example two speakers may differentially rank probable and likely but when one reports that X is probable it does not follow that there will be a communication failure
Misunderstandings will occur only with major inversions such as between likely and unlikely or likely and definite
This is because of the level of resolution applied
There is evidence that the resolution of uncertainty expressed in natural language is quite low ie Zimmer found that the mean number of expressions between the extremes of the probability range was implying the use of on average a point pointed out by Budescu and Wallsten this level of resolution is highly plausible given repeated demonstrations that humans can not handle discriminate or reliably transmit information about more than approximately seven distinct categories Miller p 
KONG BARNETT MOSTELLER AND YOUTZ 
Kong Barnett Mosteller and Youtz investigated group variability the effects of response format and betweenstudy variability in the use of verbal uncertainty expressions among medical personnel
Specifically physicians medical students and other medical personnel assigned numerical values to expressions using one or more of four response formats Table varied nonsystematically within expressions almost certain probable and likely
Estimates were made in the context of an unspecified symptomdisease combination
One of the senior physicians in your hospital has told you that a particular symptom was in the disease you were discussing
What would be your estimate of the frequency of this symptom in was to be filled by one of the twelve expressions listed in Table 
Subjects responded using one of the four response formats indicated in Table 
The expressions in order of means with response formats in parentheses are shown in Table 
Results showed low variability between the three subject groups identified by the authors physicians house officers medical students and other medical professionals the mean range of group medians among expressions being 
Data was therefore pooled across subject groups for subsequent analyses
Results showed that for probable and likely response format had no effect on mean assignment
For almost certain however the mean on the HP scale was higher than the mean on the US scale and higher than the mean on the FC scale though differences in medians were not as great nor in the same direction
No significance tests are reported however and therefore no clear conclusions can be drawn
whose means were nearer the center of the distribution than the extremes and subadditivity was found to occur for the means of the symmetric pair likely and unlikely
""
A crossstudy comparison on results for expressions Table employed at least twice over studies Kong et al Kenney Bryant and Norman Mapes and Toogood showed that the largest mean difference between expressions was and the average difference for expressions with means between and ie excluding the more extreme expressions for which ranges are typically lower was 
This was considered quite low given that such crossstudy comparison confounds a number of factors whose effect would be to inflate apparent differences
Assessment
The primary observation is that if response format did affect numerical assignments then since no consistent response format was employed comparison of results for different expressions is unreliable as is betweenstudy comparison
A secondary observation is that like some of the studies the domain of uncertainty
For example not unreasonable has value connotations and frequent almost never and never are plainly frequentistic
The majority of the expressions employed in the crossstudy analysis fall into this latter category questioning the specificity of the results to uncertainty expressions
WALLSTEN FILLENBAUM AND COX 
The most systematic study of the effects of context sensitivity on the meaning of verbal uncertainty terms was carried out by Wallsten Fillenbaum and Cox henceforth Wallsten et al
a who investigated the effects of prior probabilities on the interpretation of verbal expressions
Context effects have been demonstrated for some types of adverbial quantifiers
For example Borges and Sawyers found that the meaning of most lots many some several and few in the context of frequencies of marbles varied with the total number available Pepper and Prytulak found that seldom sometimes frequently very often varied as a function of the expected frequency of the event quantified eg shooting in Hollywood westerns vs earthquakes in California and Mapes found that physicians assessments of the meaning of rare in the context of side effects of betablockers were more extreme than similar assessments in the context of antihistamines
Wallsten et al
b report two studies since the results of the first study were extended in the second the former is not described here
The second study was preceded by a pilot study to determine perceived base rates for a number of scenarios
For the pilot study scenarios were devised each with levels of a variable designed to induce low intermediate or high judgements of priors
For example What is the probability of snowfall in Montreal in SeptemberNovemberMarch Three sets of materials were prepared each containing all scenarios were given one of the sets and instructed to assess the probability of each scenario being true
Thirtysix scenarios were selected for which assignments in the high and low value scenarios differed by a tscore of at least 
The mean estimated probability of the high level of scenario ranged from to and from to for the low level
The mean difference between levels was 
The main study employed eighteen expressions classified by the authors as probability expressions and frequency expressions Table 
Each of the scenarios obtained from the pilot study was combined with of these expressions at each of its two levels of base rate to produce distinct statements
For each scenario the selected expressions were chosen on the basis of plausibility rather than random assignment
As an example the statements for a scenario concerning air pollution were generated from the expressions by base rates in the following frame
There is TOOLONG to be higher air pollution in LouisvillePittsburg than indicates option set
The statements were split into sets of each consisting of scenarios x base rates
Each level of base rate appeared with the same probability or frequency expression
Each of the stimulus sets was administered to one group of subjects
The experiment can therefore be described as a factorial intertwined design the three factors independent variables being scenario base rates highlow and expression 
For each statement subjects were asked to provide direct estimates of the probability that a hypothetical expert might have meant by the particular probability or frequency expression and further to indicate the upper and lower bounds of the range that might have been intended
These were treated as three separate dependent variables though since similar effects were found for all three upper and lower limits are omitted from the following discussion
Subjects assignments were found to be sensitive to expressions and also to base rates within virtually every scenario
The mean variable was with a standard deviation of 
This compares with a mean difference of for the unquantified statements in the pilot study
The base rate effect itself was found to vary systematically across expressions
Mean assignment in the main task was plotted as a function of base rate for each of the expressions using points constituted by scenarios x levels of the variable
These were then fitted with linear structural equations Isaacs which simultaneously minimize the sum of square deviations over both axes
For each linear structural equation a slope of would indicate that interpretation of a prediction is determined completely by base rates or that subjects are judging base rates a slope of would indicate that base rates have no effect on interpretation and a slope between and would indicate that both base rates and the quantifying expression have an effect on the interpretation of the prediction or alternatively that some subjects judge base rates and some the independent data is considered
For the expressions sure likely probable good chance possible and poor chance and for a similar number of the frequency expressions not discussed here slopes were low positive and significantly different from both and 
For these expressions interpretation of the meaning of an expression in a statement appears to be a combination of the base rate of the event described and the independent meaning of the quantifying expression
Thus when an expression is applied to an event with a high base rate relative to the independent meaning of that expression the resulting prediction will be judged to have a probability lower than that base rate
When the situation is reversed the expression will be judged to have a probability higher than the base rate
The critical level or context independent meaning is the value at the intercept between the linear structural equation and the identity line in the sense that
As an example the linear structural equation for the expression likely crosses the identity line approximately at the coordinates 
For scenarios with a base rate greater than obtained in the pilot study the effect of quantification by likely is to reduce the perceived probability of that event
For scenarios with a base rate less than quantification by likely will increase the perceived probability of the event
In other words the interpretation of these expressions as measured by their assigned probabilities is between the context independent value for likely and the perceived base rate of the event being quantified or as Wallsten et al
assert It is as if the subjects interpretations of the experts predictions represent some kind of an average between the prior probability of the event and the meaning of the probabilistic modifier p 
The difference between high and low uncertainty expressions is attributed to their relative weight in the averaging process than are neutral or high probability expressions p 
If this is true base rates would be expected to have little effect for lower expressions such as unlikely and would explain why slopes for these expressions are generally lower
Assessment
There are a number of corollaries and caveats to the interpretation of the results outlined
Firstly the explanation of the differences between the low and nonlow expressions implies that the interpretation of low probability expressions is not affected by base rates
This was true for the expression unlikely whose slope was significantly different from but not 
However for the expressions improbable and doubtful slopes were neither significantly different from nor implying that interpretation of the statements is related neither to base rates nor to contextindependent meaning of the quantifying expression
Secondly evidence for the proposed base rate shift is based on the assumption that the numerical assignments made by subjects are themselves not affected by base is affected by the perceived base rates of the event being described then it is arguable that numerical expressions such as would be affected in the same way
In other words if the meaning of the expression likely is affected by the prior of the event it describes then why is this not the case for expressions such as Could it be that really means when applied to a proposition with a high prior and when applied to a proposition with a low prior There is nothing specific to numerical expressions that predisposes them to being veridical
If both verbal uncertainty expressions and numerical uncertainty expressions are seen as ways of summarizing reasons for believing and reasons for disbelieving a proposition then it is arguable that they will be affected by the same kinds of phenomena
Thirdly the overall mean difference between base rate levels across expressions was found to be in the pilot study but in the main study
Wallsten et al
attribute this difference to it is clear that since the base rate pairs were selected on a nonrandom basis ie only those with tscore differences this difference must reflect some regression towards the mean though how much it is not possible to gauge
Ideally once the set of stimuli had been selected a further group of subjects would have judged the probability of each event and these values would be used as base rates in the main study
Fourthly as suggested above rather than supporting an averaging hypothesis as Wallsten et al
suggest it is clear that the postulated averaging process for the group data might simply be due to subgroups of subjects each assessing either the independent meanings of the expressions or the priors of the events they quantify
WALLSTEN BUDESCU RAPOPORT ZWICK AND FORSYTH 
Although a considerable theoretical literature exists on Fuzzy Set Theory empirical work is relatively sparse
The terms that have been investigated empirically include large small short cold warm obsolete up to date and old young reviewed by Wallsten et al
b p 
In some cases investigators have also assessed the effects of quantification by modifiers such as not very not very sort of and so on on the resulting membership functions
Wallsten Budescu Rapoport Zwick and Forsyth henceforth Wallsten et al employed two variants of a graded pair comparison procedure to determine fuzzy membership functions for a number of verbal uncertainty expressions
In the first variant two radially divided spinners with segments of opposing colors denoting different probabilities were presented on a computer monitor
On each trial one of ten uncertainty expressions Table was printed above the spinners
Subjects task was to indicate which spinner probability was best represented by the expression by moving an of displacement represented the relative appropriateness of the two spinners
Probabilities on the two spinners were varied factorially for each expression and subject within a previously elicited individual range intended to represent the maximum and minimum probability points of applicability for each expression
Responses arrow positions were analyzed using conjointmeasurement theory and values obtained for each term according to various scaling models
These values were normalized to be nonnegative with an arbitrary maximum of and plotted against probability values to produce membership functions
In a second variant of the task conducted to validate results of the first two uncertainty expressions were presented with one spinner on each trial
The task was to indicate via arrow position which of the expressions was better represented by the spinner probability and by how much
The entire procedure was repeated on each of three occasions of approximately two days separation employing graduate students as subjects
The data analyzed were for the second and third sessions
Stimulus expressions appear in Table 
expressions were judged by all subjects doubtful tossup likely improbable good chance and possible while the others were judged by half the subjects
During trials an index card was constantly in view listing all the expressions the subject would encounter during the course of the experiment
Analysis of the ranges of upper and lower values showed considerable variability between subjects
The lowest variability was obtained for the expressions almost certain almost impossible and tossup
For the expression possible the st and rd quartiles of the estimated upper limit were approximately and respectively values inferred from graph indicating major disagreement in the semantics of this expression as operationalized in the study
Thirtythree percent of the membership functions obtained were multipeaked
The remaining were either point flat monotonic or single peaked 
There was no expression shape
Expressions nearer the extremes of the probability scale tended to be monotonic rather than single peaked
Fuzzy membership functions are generally not characterized as having multipeaked distributions
Such distributions imply either ambiguity in the meaning of an expression measurement error or inappropriateness of the variable over which the function is measured
Wallsten et al
attributed the multiple peaked nature of some of these functions to measurement error and it is arguable that the number of multipeaked distributions would decrease if the sample size of responses from which membership functions are derived were to increase
Interpretation of the results of this study was confounded by sampling probabilities over ranges specified by subjects
Such estimates may be conservative preventing assessment of complete membership functions for each subject and making betweensubject comparison difficult
A second study was carried out to rectify this deficiency
Study II
In the second study the eight most accurate subjects completed tasks similar to those described earlier using probabilities sampled over identical and broader ranges with a reduced stimulus set the unlikely and possible being omitted
For this second study of the functions were found to be monotonic and single peaked the extreme expressions tending to have monotonic functions and the more central ones single peaked
In general membership functions for any individual were stable over sessions but differed considerably from subject to subject for all expressions except tossup and doubtful
Tossup yielded single peak functions for all subjects doubtful yielded monotonic decreasing functions for the subjects who judged it
For the remaining phrases there were a mixture of single peaked and monotonic functions
Further sameshaped functions were not across identical ranges
For example peaks in singlepeaked functions were not coincident
Comparisons of results between the two experiments showed that of the membership functions obtained in study were the same shape as their corresponding functions in study indicating not unreasonable withinsubject variability across the two experiments
Wallsten et al
interpreted these results as deriving membership functions for verbal uncertainty expressions
Assessment
Although monotonic and single peaked functions are clearly consistent with the semantics proposed by fuzzy set theory the theoretic models employed by Zimmer Bonissone and others are trapezoidal
This means that functions derived from techniques such as the RobbinsMonroe procedure Zimmer or implementations such as that of Bonissone et al
 are at best approximations to the true underlying functions though it is difficult to gauge the extent and therefore significance of the departure
What is clear however is that many data points may be required to produce reliable membership functions for some individuals
RAPOPORT WALLSTEN AND COX 
The studies described earlier have employed a variety of direct and indirect scaling procedures for investigating the use of verbal uncertainty expressions but with little discussion of the particular characteristics of the procedures employed
The psychophysical and psychological literatures have provided numerous demonstrations however that the technique employed to investigate a particular behavior or mental of verbal uncertainty expressions then as in other scientific tasks a theory of the measuring instrument or procedure is essential to an understanding of the observed phenomenon
Rapoport et al
provided the first comprehensive evaluation of two distinct procedures for scaling verbal uncertainty expressions in a comparison of the membership functions derived from a direct estimation task DE and a graded pair comparison task PC
These two procedures differ in so far as the PC procedure is a priori more reliable since it requires comparative rather than absolute judgments and it is possible to check for internal consistency in a set of judgments but is more time consuming
In turn ordinal scaling tasks are considered more reliable than both DE and PC tasks since they require only ordinal levels of judgment
The pragmatic rationale for such a comparison is that cross validation of the two procedures equivalent membership functions would suggest that the less laborious DE procedure might be substituted for the pair comparison procedure in the investigation of verbal uncertainty expressions
less data
In this study four groups of five subjects each scaled five of thirteen expressions Table in three tasks across three sessions for practice and for data collection separated by days
The expressions were divided into three groups corresponding to high probability first two rows in Table neutral middle row and low probability bottom two rows
Each expression was associated with a set of probability values determined from the ranges in Wallsten et al

These covered a range of of the unit interval at intervals of 
For low expressions the values were for the neutral expression they were and for the high expressions 
""
""
""
These values were represented as yellow sectors on spinners
The membership functions derived were thus highly discrete
The DE task consisted of a number of trials in which an expression of the associated probabilities
The task was to indicate using a joystick how well the expression described the probability indicated on the spinner
A total of repetitions x expressions x probabilities were used to generate membership functions for each expression and subject
The PC task employed the same graded pair comparison procedure as Wallsten et al
b above
A third ordinal scaling task rank ordering RO was also administered in which an expression was printed at the top of the screen above six spinners representing the associated probability values
The task was to rank the spinners according to how well each was described by the expression
Inclusion of this task permitted comparison of results for the DE and PC tasks with this more reliable task the relative validity of the DE and PC procedures being assessed by the degree to which the membership functions generated accord with the ordinal data from this RO task
As in Wallsten et al
b membership functions were derived from data for the DE have maxima of 
Analysis across sessions showed the three procedures to be equally consistent with membership functions being roughly constant for each person but differing between individuals
As a result of the latter Rapoport et al
argued that the results would be troublesome for designers of expert systems who wish to incorporate membership functions representing the meanings of particular terms
""
Analysis of the membership functions showed that allowing for single inversions whose magnitude did not exceed zz of all functions of the functions derived from the DE and PC procedures were monotonic or single peaked though for the expression possible of the functions were neither weakly monotonic nor single peaked
These results are comparable with those of Wallsten et al
b
Comparison of the DE and PC functions showed that for virtually every expression and subject the two procedures yielded the same shape functions
However with the exception of the expression possible the functions yielded by those elicited by the PC procedure v suggesting that the DE functions are more fuzzy
Ordinal properties of the PCderived functions were closer to those from the RO procedure than were the DEderived functions endorsing the a priori expectation that the PC procedure is more reliable than the DE procedure
On practical grounds however it was argued that since the resulting functions are not so different the DE method may yield functions that are sufficiently accurate for some lower resolution purposes
The functions generated in this study were also used to test the applicability of various operators suggested by Zadeh for modeling the effect of quantification on the meaning of an expression for the modifiers very and rather
Zadeh s claim is that if the meaning of an expression X can be modeling by a fuzzy membership function over some variable then the meaning of an expression such as very X is simply a membership function over the same variable determined by
The operators investigated were concentration and intensification
Concentration has the effect of creating a membership function for the modified expression that is less than that for the unmodified expression in parts of the distribution where the latter is less than 
Intensification has the effect of increasing values in the membership function that are greater than and decreasing those that are below 
The effects of the modifier rather were found to be unsystematic and not described by either of Zadeh s proposed models suggesting that the modifier rather should be eschewed in the development of systems for specific applied purposes p 
Effects of modification by very also varied between subjects but Zadeh s concentration model worked well for of the out of cases for which the unmodified membership function was monotonic
Assessment
The existence of individual differences between the derived membership functions is beyond dispute
The conclusion of Rapoport et al
concerning expert system design is misleading however since too large to render them unusable
As in the earlier discussions of other studies it is useful to think in terms of the amount of miscomprehension encountered between two speakers whose functions differ
A more general question is whether the individual variability reflects the appropriateness of the fuzzy set model for verbal uncertainty expressions
For the expression possible doubts are raised
Critical Discussion
In the introduction a number of questions relating to withinsubject variability betweensubject variability and context dependency were raised in connection with the use of verbal uncertainty expressions
These are discussed in the following sections
WITHINSUBJECT VARIABILITY
Withinsubject variability was generally found to be low Johnson Bryant and Norman BeythMarom Budescu and Wallsten Rapoport et al
 though only the study of Budescu and Wallsten made a serious attempt to control for simple replication of performance effects
The time between replications was too small in other studies
BETWEENSUBJECT VARIABILITY
There are conflicting conclusions with respect to betweensubject variability
A Bryant and Norman Budescu and Wallsten or specifically point to large individual differences Wallsten et al
b Rapoport et al
 while others interpret their results as showing encouragingly low variability Lichtenstein and Newman Kong et al
""
The basis for this apparent disagreement appears to be the variety of scaling procedures employed and implicit notions of resolution
The studies that have reported range variance statistics have done so with little or no theoretical rationale and have not attempted to quantitatively draw out the implications of their findings
Whereas a standard deviation of in numerical assignment would constitute low variability in some circumstances it might be considered high in others
A consensus measure of betweensubject variability would be beneficial though it is also clear that such a measure must embody some notion of the granularity of information in the task for which it is to be used
The same applies to the interpretation of the significance of rank inversions
Generally communication failure will occur only with unlikely or likely and definite but not because of ordinal variability between similar terms such as probable and likely
Indeed empirical estimates of the resolution level of uncertainty expressions appear to be approximately about the number of different categories that can be reliably processed Miller 
Two factors that confound the analysis of betweensubject variability are stimuli set composition and the nature of the scaling tasks themselves
STIMULUS SET COMPOSITION
Many studies employed a large number of distinctly nonprobabilistic or not uncertainty based expressions
These included frequentistic expression usually seldom and slightly moreless than half the time Lichtenstein and Newman always sometimes and never Bryant and Norman always never often frequently seldom rarely usually and usually not Budescu and Wallsten never Kong et al
 expressions embodying utility considerations best bet Bryant and Norman comparative expressions most likely BeythMarom logical expressions is consistent with is compatible with effectively excludes can not be excluded Bryant and Norman expressions involving expectation fair chance good chance Lichtenstein and Newman expected Bryant and Norman meaningful chance BeythMarom expressions of prototypicality pathognomonic classic and normally Bryant and Norman and a host of other expressions that are difficult to classify as unequivocally probabilistic rather and inconclusive Lichtenstein and Newman hopefully Bryant and Norman one must consider one ca nt rule it out entirely not inevitable perhaps one should assume and reasonable to assume BeythMarom not unreasonable Bryant and Norman Kong et al
 predictable unpredictable common and uncommon Budescu and Wallsten necessary feasible conceivable and possible Reyna 
The inclusion of these expressions both Undermines the specificity of results to the domain of uncertainty expressions and inflates the apparent value of rangevariability statistics by requiring subjects to scale what are heterogeneous strictly noncomparable stimuli on the same unidimensional scale
SCALING TASKS
The problems with the scaling tasks are twofold
Firstly direct scaling tasks are of low ecological validity
In general when reasoning about uncertainty people do not translate verbal expressions into numerical estimates even if the precision of the available information is high
Verbal estimates like numerical values are essentially ways of summarizing the available information into a particularly good at translating one frequently used way of summarizing uncertainty into another seldomly employed representation The fact that people rarely communicate uncertainty numerically questions the use of numerical assignment tasks for assessing verbal representation of uncertainty
Secondly and more significantly assessing the properties of verbal uncertainty expressions such as betweensubject variability context effects can not be achieved by the direct assignment of numerical values since these have their own scaling properties which confound the analysis
Adequate assessments can only be achieved by the use of independent measures of probability such as the spinner task employed by Wallsten and colleagues where there is an independent scale against which assessments can be compared
In sum there appears to be little justification for assessing the variability of verbal uncertainty expressions by the use of direct assessment of numerical values
CONTEXT DEPENDENCY
The study of Johnson found no difference in task context and the study of BeythMarom produced results that are difficult to interpret for reasons discussed earlier
The study of estimates assigned to verbal uncertainty expressions may be influenced by the perceived base rate of the event being described although the alternate interpretation is that the apparent conditioning on base rates is an artefact of averaging the results of different processing strategies rather than representing variation within samples of homogeneous processing strategy
If verified however their suggestion would have a number of implications for the use and interpretation of verbal uncertainty expressions in Al though demonstration is awaited
Firstly it would follow that interpretation of verbal uncertainty terms will be expected to be influenced by factors that affect perception of base rates including availability and other cognitive biases
Secondly information concerning perceived base rates or priors would need to be incorporated into an interface that sought to communicate degrees of uncertainty to a user
Thirdly it suggests the intriguing possibility that such expressions may serve partially to act as indicators of change in confidence rather than of confidence level per se
Such a notion is embodied in the certainty factor formalism developed in the Expert System assumption of unidimensionality that the expressions employed can be characterized as points regions or fuzzy subsets on a unidimensional scale pervades all the studies reported but was explicitly addressed in only one Reyna 
This study provided data that was not incommensurate with a unidimensional view of uncertainty but has a number of methodological flaws described earlier
Thus the question of dimensionality is empirically open
What is clear however is that many of the expressions employed in the studies described do not fit neatly into a unidimensional mould see discussion of betweensubject variability for examples
It has also been argued that the pervasiveness of the unidimensional assumption has had the effect of obscuring the rich semantics that underlie many verbal uncertainty expressions eg Fox a b Teigen 
CONCLUSION
Overall there is little evidence to suggest that verbal uncertainty expressions are inappropriate for communicating uncertainties in expert systems and other decision technologies
Equally however their appropriateness awaits validation distribution
One method of determining whether the distribution of estimates for the BeythMarom data is approximately normal is to check whether the estimates of standard deviation inferrable from her figures for the IQR and range are approximately equal
From Ztables the IQR occupies that part of the distribution between and standard deviations and the range occurs between and standard deviations
BeythMarom s mean figures for these ranges are and respectively
These lead to standard deviation estimates of and respectively
Thus we have evidence to suggest that the population of responses is approximately normally distributed
The general formula for the variance of differences between samples from populations with equal means and variances Ferguson is
Multiple line equation s can not be represented in ASCII text 
where sigma is the variance of the population being sampled
When N N it follows that the standard error of the difference between samples is approximately standard deviations
is thus the IQR gives a reasonable indication of the average pairwise difference between any pair of scores whereas the range does not

INTRODUCTION
This paper aims to provide a descriptive and analytical account of Buddhist psychology
It does not attempt a comprehensive review of the subject the literature literature are too vast to permit a comprehensive review in a single paper
What is presented here is essentially a selective account of the psychological notions found in Buddhism
Only some of the major concepts are discussed
Some practical aspects of Buddhist psychology that have a relevance to therapeutic practice are also reviewed
The paper is selective in another important way
It is confined to Theravada Buddhism also referred to as Early Buddhism and does not deal with later developments including Zen
For an account of Theravada Buddhism see Gombrich for a discussion of the different schools of Buddhism see Kalupahana Snelling and Thomas 
The Literature
The literature of Early Buddhism is in the Pali language
It consists of the original Buddhist canon which was put together soon after the Buddha s death and committed to writing in the first century BC the early Pali commentaries on the canon that were in their present form by the end of the same period which are best described as expository and interpretive works
The canon consists of three parts Sutta Pitaka which contains the discourses of the Buddha on various occasions throughout his preaching life Vinaya Pitaka which contains the rules of discipline for the monks and Abhidhama Pitaka which contains highly systematized philosophical and psychological analyses which were finalized in their present form about BC later than the material in the other two parts
A full account of the Pall canon is given in Webb 
The individual books of the canon are listed in Table 
The early Pall commentaries include major texts such as Sumangalavilasini Manorathapurani Papancasudani and Dhammapadatthakatha which are commentaries on specific parts of the canon
The early expository and interpretive texts include among others Visuddhimagga Milindapanha and Nettippakarana
Problems of Translation
The entire canon and the majority of the commentaries and expository works have been translated into English and published by the Pali Text Society 
However the English versions are often beset with problems of translation and interpretation
Perhaps it is worth illustrating this problem with examples
A major example is the term dukkha Sanskrit duhkha translated by many as suffering
This has led to Buddhism being described as essentially a pessimistic religion as suffering is stated as characterizing all existence
Some authors have offered alternative translations such as unsatisfactoriness disharmony and painfulness Gunaratna Matthews 
None of these offers a precise rendering of the original term and Rahula among others leaves the term untranslated
Another example is the very challenging term papanca Sanskrit prapanca derived from pra panc to spread out
In his book The Principles of Buddhist Psychology David Kalupahana consistently translates this as obsession
This is clearly misleading although the official PaliEnglish Dictionary of the Pali Text Society Rhys as one rendering of this word
This is a key term in Buddhist psychology and has been variously translated as impediment conceptual proliferation manifoldness diffusion complex and imagination among others
This will be returned to in a later paragraph
It should be clear from these examples that the problem of translation is a major obstacle to one s understanding of Early Buddhism or indeed any other ancient system of thought
For this reason the material in this paper is drawn from the original Pall texts
The Buddha and Buddhism
Before focusing on Buddhist psychology it is necessary to make a few introductory comments on Buddha and Buddhism
The Buddha the word derived from the root budh to know to comprehend literally means the enlightened one lived in the foothills of the Himalayan range of mountains in Northern India from to BC For excellent accounts of the and Schumann useful accounts are also available in Carrithers and Saddhatissa 
The main teachings of the Buddha are contained in the Four Noble Truths
See Rahula and Saddhatissa for a fuller discussion of the main tenets of Buddhism
These are i that life is characterized by suffering and is unsatisfactory dukkha ii that the cause samudaya of the suffering is craving or desire tanha iii that this suffering can be ended nirodha via the cessation of craving or desire this is the state of Nibbana and iv that there is a way magga to achieve this cessation which is called the Noble Eightfold Path eg Samyutta Nikaya V 
The Noble Eightfold Path is also called the Middle Path as it avoids the extremes of a sensuous and luxurious life on the one hand
The eight aspects of the Path are right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
The person who undertakes a life based on this path renouncing worldly attachments hopes eventually to attain the arahant state which may be described as a state of perfection the word arahant literally means the worthy one
This state marks the attainment of Nibbana
The other teachings of the Buddha include the negation of a permanent and unchanging soul anatta and the notion of the impermanence or transience of things anicca eg Majjhima Nikaya 
Buddhism also excludes the notion of a God There is no creator or a supreme being who rules purveys and controls the universe
Thus there is no absolutism in Buddhism either in the form of an external God or an unchanging universe or an unchanging soul
For the laity the vast majority of to the immediate quest for Nibbana the Buddha provided a sound and pragmatic social ethic
They were expected to lead a life characterized by restraint and moderation respecting the rights of others and being dutiful to those around them
Such a restrained and dutiful life was considered not only to be a necessary prerequisite for one s ultimate religious aim it was also valued as an end in itself
For example the Buddha advised his lay followers to abstain from alcoholic beverages because alcohol indulgence could lead to demonstrable illeffects such as loss of wealth proneness to socially embarrassing behavior unnecessary quarrels disrepute illhealth and eventual mental derangement Sigalovada Sutta Digha Nikaya III 
This empirical and pragmatic approach is a prominent feature of the ethical stance of Buddhism
For a discussion of Buddhist ethics see Saddhatissa and Tachibana 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF BUDDHISM THEORY
The considerable interest shown by modern students in Buddhist psychology becomes entirely understandable when it is realized that
Some parts of the canonical texts as well as later writings are examples of explicit psychological theorizing while many of the others present psychological assumptions and much material of psychological relevance
For example the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains a highly systematized psychological account of human behavior and mind and the translation of one of the Abhidhamma books the Dhammasangani was given the title A Buddhist Manual of Psychological Ethics by its translator Caroline Rhys Davids when it was first published in 
The practice of Buddhism as a religion and a way of life involves much in terms of psychological change
The ultimate religious goal of the arahant state both reflects upon and requires major psychological changes
The path towards the achievement of this goal the Noble Eightfold Path involves steps which can only be described as psychological eg right thought right understanding
As the goal is attainable essentially through one s own efforts it is not surprising that Buddhism has much to say about one s thinking God one can turn to for one s salvation
Nor did the Buddha claim to be able to ensure any of his followers the attainment of the goal
On the contrary the Buddha explicitly stated that he was only a teacher who could show the way and that the actual task of achieving the goal was up to each individual s efforts
As a muchquoted passage in the Dhammapada which is part of the Khuddaka Nikaya says The task has to be accomplished by yourselves
The Enlightened Ones only teach the way
SOME BASIC NOTIONS
In the following sections some of the main psychological aspects of Buddhism will be discussed
Motivation
Perhaps the most logical starting point is the theory of motivation
What drives people in their behaviors What motivates human action The unenlightened person s behavior it is said is governed and driven by tanha or craving which as noted in a previous paragraph is given as the cause of suffering or classified into three basic forms kama tanha craving for sensory gratification bhava tanha craving for survival or continued existence and vibhava tanha craving for annihilation eg Samyutta Nikaya V 
It is interesting that these three primary drives in Buddhism have been compared by some authors to the Freudian notions of libido ego and thanatos respectively de Silva 
Like Freudian theory this theory of motivation may be seen as a primarily reductionist one all actions have as their source a small number of drives
While craving is seen as the source of suffering the term tanha is not exclusively used in a negative sense
There are several instances in the literature where it is acknowledged that one can also develop a tanha for the cessation of suffering
Thus tanha can take the form of or can be turned into a desirable force
For example the expository text Nettippakarana says Here
While the unwholesome kind goes with the unsatisfactory worldly existence the wholesome kind leads to the abandonment of craving
""
In a further analysis of motivation Buddhism identifies three factors that lead to unwholesome or undesirable behaviors
These are raga passion or lust dosa hatred or malice and moha delusion or false belief eg Anguttara Nikaya I II 
All unwholesome action is seen as deriving from a set of fundamental roots
In fact the texts explicitly refer to these as roots mula
They are called akusalamulas for example unwholesome or unprofitable roots
It is not made explicit whether these always operate at a conscious level
On the other hand certain clearly nonconscious factors also have a part to play in determining behavior
One such group of factors mentioned is anusaya translated as latent tendency latent bias predisposition and latent disposition
always in bad sense Rhys Davids and Stede p 
The term itself from anu si to lie down lie dormant indicates that these are nonconscious factors
These dispositional factors are part and parcel of one s personality acquired through past experience and they play their part in influencing one s behavior and contribute to the perpetuation of the cycle of suffering
Seven types of anusaya are often mentioned
The list given in Samyutta Nikaya V is as follows tendency to want pleasure tendency to anger or disgust tendency to speculation tendency to doubt tendency to conceit tendency to want continuous existence or growth and tendency to ignorance
Another group of factors which are nonconscious and which influence one s behavior are the asavas Sanskrit asrava from the root sru to flow or ooze
This term has been variously translated as influxes and cankers
These are factors higher
It is said that they intoxicate and bemuddle the mind Rhys Davids and Stede p 
They color one attitudes and thwart one s insight
In one s endeavor for selfdevelopment one has to excise them and this is done through wisdom
The influxes are described as arising from different factors sensuality aggression cruelty body and individuality are given in one account Digha Nikaya III 
Other lists include among others gain loss fame disrepute and evil intentions Anguttara Nikaya IV
Motives for good or wholesome action are usually expressed in negative terms
The most consistent account is the one which gives araga nonpassion or absence of passion adosa nonhatred or absence of hatred and amoha nondelusion or absence of delusion as the roots of good action the opposites of the roots of unwholesome behaviours Anguttara Nikaya I terms as caga renunciation metta loving kindness and panna wisdom understanding Anguttara Nikaya III
It is stated that one must strive to develop these in order to combat their opposites
Perception and Cognition
Perception is based on twelve gateways or modalities ayatana six of these being the five sense organs plus the mind or inner sense and the other six being the objects of each of these Samyutta Nikaya II 
The status of mind mano is special
It has the ability to reflect on the objects of the other senses so in this way it is linked to the activity of all the senses Kalupahana 
Each combination of sense organ and its objects leads to a particular consciousness vinnana for example visual consciousness arises because of the eye and material shapes
When consciousness is added to each of the pairs of modalities one gets eighteen factors of cognition are presented in Table 
It is said
The meeting of the three ie eye material shape and visual consciousness is contact because of this contact arises feeling what one feels one perceives
Majjhima Nikaya 
This is a fairly straightforward account of how perception takes place
However the Buddhist exposition goes beyond this
The account continues
What one perceives one reasons about
What one reasons about one turns into papanca
What one turns into papanca because of that factor assails him in regard to material shapes recognizable by the eye belonging to the past the future and the present
""
""
Majjhima Nikaya 
It will be recalled that the term papanca was cited in an earlier paragraph as an example of a word posing particular difficulties for the translator
In this passage the verbal form papanceti is used
Thus the final stage of the process of the term in various contexts related to cognition shows that it refers to the grosser conceptual aspect of the process as it is consequent to vitakka reasoning
Once an object is perceived there is initial application of thought to it followed by papanca which in this context is best taken to mean a tendency to proliferation of ideas
As a result the person is no longer the perceiver who is in control but one who is assailed by concepts generated by this prolific tendency
He is overwhelmed by concepts and linguistic conventions
One s perception is in this way open to distortion and elaboration due to the spontaneous proliferation of thoughts
This proliferation is said to be linked to tanha craving mana conceit and dittthi dogma or rigidly held views Maha Niddesa I 
They are all bound up with the notions of I and mine
This marks the intrusion of the ego into the field of sense atta Sanskrit atman but the delusion of self affects all one s behaviors Sutta Nipata 
One of the aims of personal development is to enable oneself to see reality as it is without the essential distortions arising from the various factors that characterize the unenlightened person s functioning
A major aspect of reaching the state of arahant is indeed the freeing of one s perceptions from these distorting influences
When one reaches a state of perfection one s perceptions become free of such distortions and allow a direct appraisal of the objects
The Arahant State
It is perhaps the appropriate place now to consider the arahant state and its attainment
The religious goal of a Buddhist is to attain this state which marks the end of the cycle of suffering
This requires a process of personal development involving disciplined living sila serious meditative efforts marked by concentration samadhi and wisdom panna which is attained through such efforts
But what There are numerous descriptions of an arahant in the texts
For example
The arahant has destroyed the cankers lived the life done what s needed to be done set down the burden achieved wellbeing shattered life s fetters and is freed by perfect knowledge
He has applied himself to six things to dispassion to detachment to harmlessness to the destruction of craving to the destruction of rasping and to nondelusion
Anguttara Nikaya III
In psychological terms the arahant s actions no longer emanate from the common basic motives of passion hatred and delusion
He is however capable of joy or positive sentiment
He has loving kindness metta to all and compassion karuna
He indulges in nothing and is restrained in his behavior
Nine standards of behavior are listed which an arahant can not and does not transgress taking life stealing sexual contact uttering falsehoods enjoying the comforts of wealth delusion and through fear Anguttara Nikaya IV
They contribute to society by being teachers and advisers and are no burden on their fellow beings
PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF BUDDHIST PSYCHOLOGY Personal Development and Meditation
It was noted above that the attainment of the arahant state requires personal development based on both restrained and disciplined conduct and meditative efforts
This explains why meditation is given a central place in Buddhist texts
In addition to numerous canonical discussions large sections of Buddhaghosa s Visuddhimagga are devoted to a consideration of this subject in great detail
It is significant that the Pall word for Meditation bhavana etymologically means development or cultivation
""
As there is a large and still growing amount of literature on this subject in English only a few brief comments will be made here
Detailed discussions are available in Pradhan SoleLeris and Vajiranana see also Claxton and Kwee 
Two forms of meditation are and the other vipassana insight
While further forms of meditation have been developed in later forms of Buddhism and these include various Tibetan and Zen techniques these two represent the earliest Buddhist techniques dating back years
It is worth noting that meditation of the samatha type is also found in some other ancient Indian systems while vipassana is a uniquely Buddhist development Nanamoli Rahula 
The word samatha means tranquility or serenity
Samatha meditation is aimed at reaching states of consciousness characterized by progressively greater levels of tranquility and stillness
It has two aspects a the achievement of the highest possible degree of concentration and b the progressive calming of all mental processes
This is done through increasingly concentrated focusing of attention the mind withdraws progressively from all external and internal stimuli
In the end states of pure and undistracted consciousness can be achieved
The samatha meditation procedure starts with efforts at concentrating the mind of states of what are called jhanas or mental absorption Visuddhimagga 
Vipassana or insight meditation also starts with concentration exercises using appropriate objects on which one focuses
In this procedure however once a certain level of concentration is achieved so that undistracted focusing can be maintained one goes on to examine with steady careful attention and in great detail all sensory and mental processes
Through this contemplation one becomes a detached observer of one s own activity
The objects of this contemplation are classified as fourfold body sensations mental states and mental objects for example various moral and intellectual subjects
The aim is to achieve total and immediate awareness or mindfulness of all phenomena
This leads it is claimed eventually to the full and clear perception of the impermanence of all things and beings Majjhima Nikaya I Samyutta Nikaya V 
It is held that samatha meditation by itself can needed to attain this goal
While the former leads to temporarily altered states of consciousness it is the latter which leads to enduring and thoroughgoing changes in the person and paves the way to achieving the arahant state
Benefits of Meditation
The practical implications of the claims made in Buddhism for meditation are quite clear
The meditative experiences of both types when properly carried out and developed are claimed to lead to greater ability to concentrate greater freedom from distraction greater tolerance of change and turmoil around oneself and sharper awareness and greater alertness about one s own responses both physical and mental
They would also lead more generally to greater calmness or tranquility
While the ultimate goal of perfection will require a long series of regular training periods of systematic meditation coupled with major restraint in one s conduct the more mundane benefits of meditation should be available to all serious and persisting practitioners
From an applied perspective Buddhist meditation techniques may be seen as an instrument for achieving certain psychological a stressreduction strategy comparable to the more modern techniques of relaxation
There is a substantial literature in present day clinical psychology and psychiatry which shows that meditation can produce beneficial effects in this way Carrington Kwee Shapiro West 
Studies of the physiological changes that accompany meditation have shown several changes to occur which together indicate a state of calmness or relaxation Woolfolk 
These include reduction in oxygen consumption lowered heart rate decreased breathing rate and blood pressure reduction in serum lactic acid levels and increased skin resistance and changes in blood flow
These peripheral changes are generally compatible with decreased arousal in the sympathetic nervous system
There are also certain central changes as shown by brain wave patterns
The amalgam of these physiological changes related to meditation has been called the relaxation response by some authors Benson 
Interestingly the Buddha himself advocated meditation for what we would today meditation be used to achieve trouble free sleep and as a way of controlling pain Vinaya Pitaka Samyutta Nikaya V 
It is perhaps worth dwelling briefly on the use of mindfulness meditation for pain control
A study published in by KabatZinn Lipworth and Burney reported that ninety chronic pain patients who were trained in mindfulness meditation in a tenweek stressreduction program showed significant improvement as measured by various indices in pain and related symptoms
A control group of patients who did not receive meditation training did not show such improvement
The rationale for selecting this strategy for the treatment of pain is explained as follows
In the case of pain perception the cultivation of detached observations of the pain experience may be achieved by paying careful attention and distinguishing as separate events the actual primary sensations as they occur from momenttomoment and any accompanying thoughts about pain
KabatZinn et al p 
In another paper KabatZinn rationale for using mindfulness meditation for pain control
He shows how mindfulness meditation can enable one to focus on sensations as they arise rather than attempt to escape from them
It helps one to recognize the bare physical sensation unembellished by psychological elaboration
One learns to observe these psychological aspects as separate events
This uncoupling has the effect of changing one s overall experience of pain
To quote The nociceptive signals sensory may be undiminished but the emotional and cognitive components of the pain experience the hurt the suffering are reduced KabatZinn p 
It is this detached observation of sensations that mindfulness meditation as described in the Buddhist texts helps one to develop
This makes such meditation a particularly wellsuited strategy for pain control
In fact the references in the texts to pain control by mindfulness meditation appear to make this very point
For example it is stated that the venerable Ananda the Buddha s personal assistant
On hearing from the patient that he was in much pain and that his pains were getting worse Ananda advised him to engage in the meditation of mindfulness
A similar episode is recorded with reference to another householder Manadinna Ananda once again offered the same advice
Similarly it is recorded that the Buddha himself visited two ailing monks Mogallana and Kassapa who were in pain and advised each of them to engage in mindfulness meditation
Perhaps the most impressive and most explicit in terms of the rationale for this use of meditation is the account given of the venerable Anuruddha
He was sick and was grievously afflicted
Many monks who visited him finding him calm and relaxed asked him how his painful sensations evidently made no impact on his mind
He replied It is because I have my mind wellgrounded in mindfulness
This is why the painful sensations that come upon me make no impression on my mind
The implication here is that meditation aspect of the pain for example while the physical sensations may remain intact one s vulnerability to subjectively felt pain is reduced
The above accounts are all from the Samyutta Nikaya which states this position quite explicitly in a different passage
The untrained layman when touched by painful bodily feelings grieves and laments and is distraught But the welltrained disciple when touched by painful bodily feelings will not weep nor grieve nor lament
""
""
nor will he be distraught
""
""
The layman when touched by painful bodily feelings weeps He experiences two kinds of feelings a bodily one and a mental one
It is as if a man is hit by one arrow and then by a second arrow he feels the pain of two arrows
So it is with the untrained layman when touched by a painful bodily feeling he experiences two kinds of feeling a bodily one and mental one
But the welltrained disciple not
""
""
He feels only one kind of feeling a bodily one not a mental one
It is as if a man is hit by one arrow but not by a second arrow he feels the pain of one arrow only
So it is with the welltrained disciple when touched by a painful bodily feeling he feels but one feeling bodily pain only
Samyutta Nikaya IV 
The view of pain contained in this expository account is quite clear physical pain sensations are usually accompanied by psychological correlates which are like a second pain
The disciple who is trained in mindfulness meditation however sees the physical sensation as it is and does not allow himself to be affected by the psychological elaboration of pain
Thus his experience is limited to the perception of the physical sensation only
It is this account of pain that provides the rationale for the instances cited above where those in pain are advised to engage in mindfulness Buddhism also contains a wide range of behavior change strategies other than meditation used and recommended by the Buddha and his disciples which can only be described as behavioral
This aspect of Buddhism had been neglected by modern researchers until very recently
It is only in the last few years that these behavioral strategies have been highlighted and discussed de Silva 
These strategies are remarkably similar to several of the established techniques of modern behavior therapy
Thus if Buddhist psychology is akin to modern humanistic transpersonal and existential psychologies in view of its emphasis on the individual his problems and anxieties his predicament and his development through personal effort it also has a clear affinity to presentday behavioral psychology in view of these behavioral techniques
The ways in which the overall approach of behavior modification and that of Buddhism may be seen as broadly similar have been discussed by William Mikulas 
Some areas of similarity highlighted by Mikulas are the rejection of the notion of an unchanging on testability stress on techniques for awareness of certain bodily responses emphasizing the here and now and dissemination of teachings and techniques widely and publicly
Given this broad similarity and the general TOOLONG attitude of Buddhism as exemplified by the Kalama Sutta Anguttara Nikaya I in which the Buddha advises a group of inquirers not to accept anything on hearsay authority or pure argument but to accept only what is empirically and experientially verifiable it is not surprising that specific behavior change techniques were used and recommended in Early Buddhism
It is also entirely consistent with the social ethic of Buddhism which recognized the importance of behaviors conducive to one s own and others wellbeing as a goal in its own right
When and where specific behavior changes were required both in oneself and others these were to be affected through the use of specific techniques
The range of behavioral strategies found in the literature of Early Buddhism is wide
When these are described using modern terminology and listed modern behavioral therapy manual These include fear reduction by graded exposure and reciprocal inhibition using rewards for promoting desirable behavior modelling for inducing behavioral change the use of stimulus control to eliminate undesirable behavior the use of aversion to eliminate undesirable behavior training in social skills selfmonitoring control of intrusive thoughts by distraction switchingstopping incompatible thoughts and by prolonged exposure to them intense covert focusing on the unpleasant aspects of a stimulus or the unpleasant consequences of a response to reduce attachment to the former and eliminate the latter graded approach to the development of positive feelings towards others use of external cues in behavior control use of response cost to aid elimination of undesirable behavior use of family members for carrying out behavior change programs and cognitivebehavioral methods for example for grief
Details of these have been discussed in previous publications which also give references to the original texts de Silva 
A full discussion here therefore to cite an example of this behavioral approach in Buddhism and indicate its similarity to modern parallels
For the control of unwanted intrusive cognitions which particularly hinder one s meditative efforts and can therefore be a major problem for a Buddhist several strategies are recommended
These are presented in a hierarchical fashion each to be tried if the preceding one fails
Switch to an opposite or incompatible thought
The first is to reflect on an object which is associated with thoughts which are the opposite of the unwanted thought
This means that if the unwanted cognition is associated with passion or lust one should think of something promoting lustlessness if it is associated with malice one should think of something promoting loving kindness and if it is something associated with delusion or confusion one should think of something promoting clarity
This exercise of switching to a thought that is incompatible with the unwanted one like a carpenter getting rid of a coarse peg with a fine one is claimed to
If however the unwanted thought still keeps arising one is advised to ponder on the perils and disadvantages of the thought that is to consider its harmful consequences
This would help one to rid oneself of the thought in question like in the case of a young man or woman who is eager to look nice and clean who would be revolted and disgusted if heshe finds the carcass of a snake round hisher neck and would immediately get rid of it
Ignore and distract
If that too fails the technique of ignoring an unwanted thought is recommended
One is to strive not to pay attention like a man who closed his eyes or looks in another direction in order not to see a visual object that he does not wish to see
It is suggested that various distracting activities may be used in order not to pay attention to the unwanted cognition
These include recalling of a doctrinal passage one has learned concentrating on actual
Reflect on removal of causes
If the problem still persists then a further strategy is recommended this is to reflect on the removal or stopping of the causes of the target thought
This is explained with the analogy of a man walking briskly who asks himself Why am I walking briskly then reflects on his walking and stops and stands then reflects on his standing and sits down and so on
Control with forceful effort
If this strategy too fails then a fifth method is advocated which is forcefully to restrain and dominate the mind
This use of effort is likened to a strong man holding and restraining a weaker man One is to use the effort of one part of the mind to control the other

This account is based on the Vitakkasanthana Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya and its commentary Papancasudani
The similarities between some of these Early Buddhist strategies and the techniques used for this and related Thoughtstopping thoughtswitching distraction Wolpe Marks Rachman Hodgson and covert sensitization Cautela are all foreshadowed here
It will have been noticed that the increasingly popular technique of habituation training that is instructing the client to expose himself to the thought repeatedly andor for prolonged periods Rachman is absent from this account
However a parallel of this in Early Buddhism is found in the Satipattthana Sutta also part of the Majjhima Nikaya and the Mahasatipattthana Sutta of the Digha Nikaya 
These discourses outline the important meditational technique of mindfulness which was referred to in an earlier section
Mindfulness training is not simply a formal method of meditation but is a general selfimprovement skill with the person training himself to be aware of his body and bodily actions of feelings and sensations and of thoughts and ideas as they happen
In developing mindfulness or awareness one might is advised to be alert to all thoughts that arise including unwanted ones
If an unwanted thought arises one is advised to face it directly and continuously to look straight into that thought and dwell on it
It is said that then gradually that thought will lose its intensity and will disappear Gunaratna 
The similarity between this and the habituation training paradigm of presentday therapists needs no comment
Similar comparisons can be made between most of the other behavioral strategies found in the Buddhist texts and those established in present day behavior therapy for similar purposes de Silva Mikulas 
The significance of the presence of these techniques in the Buddhist texts is manifold
Firstly it reflects the fact that Buddhism is not only concerned with one s endeavors to achieve the ultimate religious goal by a process of selfdevelopment As noted earlier it also has something to offer in the area of daytoday management of behavioral problems often as a s own and one s fellow beings benefit and happiness
Thus these techniques are applicable irrespective of whether one has committed oneself to a life devoted to the aim of personal development and ultimately the state of arahanthood
Secondly being clearly behavioral these are welldefined easy to use and above all empirically testable
Indeed the Buddhist approach is one of trying out various strategies until one that is effective is found
As seen above the Vitakkasanthana Sutta offers the disciple five different techniques for dealing with unwanted intrusive cognitions each to be tried if the preceding one fails to produce the desired results
The Buddha s advice to the Kalamas on the importance of not accepting any view as hearsay authority and so forth but only on empirical grounds reflects and embodies this approach
Indeed the Buddha s own quest for enlightenment followed this path Having tried out various methods and teachings available at the time he rejected each of them as they failed path
Thirdly the techniques are for use on oneself as well as for influencing the behavior of others numerous examples are found for both types of uses
Relevance of Buddhist Behavioral Change Strategies
From an applied perspective the relevance of this aspect of Buddhism is abundantly clear
A range of clearly defined techniques is available for use with common behavioral problems
The fact that they are similar to modern behavioral therapeutic techniques in remarkable ways has the implication that their validity and utility are already established as many of the latter have been subjected to rigorous clinical and experimental investigation
There is a strong case too for those Buddhist strategies that so far have no counterpart in modern behavioral modification to be empirically tested using clinical and experimental research methods
If grounds are then found for considering them clinically useful they can then be fruitfully incorporated into the repertoire of techniques available to the present day therapist
It can also be argued that these techniques will have particular relevance to the practice problems that arises in using methods derived from Western science with client populations of a different cultural background is that the techniques offered may seem alien to the indigenous population
Thus they may not be readily accepted or if accepted the compliance with therapeutic instructions may be poor
These cultural difficulties in therapy and counseling have been fully recognized in recent years dArdenne and Mahtani Draguns Ward On the other hand if the techniques that are used and offered although they may be an integral part of a Western psychological system are shown to be similar to ideas and practices that were accepted historically by the indigenous culture then they would have a greater chance of gaining compliance and success
How a behavioral therapy program was successfully devised for a Hindu patient which included the Hindu religious concept of karma yoga has been described by Singh and Oberhummer 
Similarly therapeutic packages that include traditional Zen practices have been used successfully with neurotic patients in that modern behavioral therapeutic strategies will be more readily acceptable to Buddhist client groups if their similarities with those found in the early Buddhist literature and the use of the same or similar techniques by the Buddha and his early disciples are highlighted
The use of meditation techniques as a stressreduction strategy with Buddhist groups in several places provides an example of this phenomenon
A case in point in the use of Buddhist meditation in a psychiatric setting in Kandy Sri Lanka de Silva Samarasinghe 
Mikulas has commented on the favorable reception accorded to the ideas and techniques of behavior modification in another Buddhist country Thailand
A further possible application of Buddhist psychology for therapeutic purposes lies in the area of prophylaxis
Theoretically there is much scope for this both with Buddhist client groups and with others
Several Buddhist techniques appear to have a potential role to play in the prevention of certain kinds of psychological disorders
For example training in meditation leading to greater ability to tolerance of the numerous inevitable stresses in modern life
One may in other words achieve a degree of immunity against the psychological effects of stress and frustration stress inoculation training of Meichenbaum 
The facility and skill in selfmonitoring one can acquire with the aid of mindfulness meditation could provide a valuable means of selfcontrol
The role of selfmonitoring in the selfregulation of behavior is welldocumented Kazdin 
The overall selfdevelopment that Buddhism encourages and recommends also has something to offer for prophylactic purposes
For example if one trains oneself not to develop intense attachments to material things and to those around one one is less likely to be vulnerable to psychological distress and disorders arising from their loss including abnormal and debilitating grief reactions
This is not to suggest that the total renunciation of all worldly comforts and attachments should be the goal of every person
Indeed very few persons in today s world will want to renounce all material things and devote themselves to the attainment of personal perfection
would remain lay persons with normal household duties and daytoday activities and pursuits and that only a relatively small number would renounce lay life completely hence the prominence given in Buddhism to lay ethics Gombrich Saddhatissa 
On the other hand some of the meditation exercises and other personal development endeavors found in Buddhism can potentially enable a person to develop an outlook on life and patterns of response which in turn will help cope with the problem of living by enabling greater calmness and assurance and with reduced vulnerability to common psychological disorders
This kind of primary prevention is certainly worth exploring
BUDDHISM AND MODERN WESTERN PSYCHOLOGY
Finally a few comments may be made on the relationship between modern Western psychology on the one hand and Buddhist psychology on the other
The relationship between the scientific psychology of the West and indigenous systems of psychology can take many forms ranging from totally independent existence to complete integration Katz 
Buddhist psychology is so only in the narrow sense in that it developed prior to and outside the context of modern Western science
It offers clearly testable hypotheses and therefore can be brought within the realm of scientific inquiry
Further as noted above the overall stance of Buddhism is an eminently empiricist one and the process of evaluating the notions and practices of its psychology is something that will be consistent with this stance
Such testing will not be alien to the spirit of Buddhism which encourages enquiry and discourages dogmatic acceptance of theories and claims Jayatilleke 
Thus Buddhist psychology can potentially make a contribution to modern scientific psychology without compromising its basic stance or that of the latter
What are the chances of the successful integration of the two In the author s view total integration between two independently developed systems of psychology each quite sophisticated does not seem to be either feasible or desirable
Modern scientific psychology will continue to evolve and grow and in the process it sources for evaluation and where the evaluation has led to positive results incorporation
Buddhist psychology will continue to be one of the indigenous psychologies that will provide many such testable concepts and techniques and thus make a contribution towards the further expansion and development of modern psychology
Beyond such interaction and influence it is not plausible to assume that the two systems in their entirety will be or can be integrated
On the other hand it is possible to envisage that a limited integration between certain aspects of Buddhist psychology and certain parallel areas of modern psychology may fruitfully be affected
Mikulas for example has argued for an integrated new system of behavior and behavior change of which both Buddhism and behavior modification are subsets
Within the broad limits of psychology it is indeed possible that such schools or areas of modern psychology which are able to derive much from or have much in common with Buddhist psychology may develop and fiuorish with such close interaction
There is a good deal of Buddhism and other ideas of personal development and enduring personal change
On this limited scale close overlap and synthesis seem possible
In the broader context Buddhist psychology is likely to keep interacting with modern psychology rather than achieving integration with it
In this interaction it will continue to make a contribution to both theory and practice in different areas and in varying degrees of significance
This contribution is likely to be particularly significant in the area of psychological therapy
This study describes the development of the Depression Proneness Rating Scale DPRS a brief selfadministered measure of the tendency to experience frequent longlasting and severe depressions and three investigations into the scale s reliability validity and factor structure
Study using university students
found a stability coefficient of for the DPRS over a testretest interval of nine weeks
Further Time T DPRS scores predicted Time T symptoms of depression even after adjusting for Time symptoms R Change 
Study using university students found the DPRS to be a better predictor of past depressive episodes r to than was the Beck Depression Inventory r 
Study using university students found that all items of the DPRS loaded or greater on a single factor for both males and females
Overall results provide substantial evidence for the DPRS as a valid Depression proneness refers to the tendency to experience relatively frequent longlasting and severe depressions
Researchers interested in uncovering the determinants of depression proneness have typically used one of three correlational designs Correlating the hypothesized determinant with current severity of depression all measures obtained in a single setting correlating the hypothesized determinant measured at Time with a measure of depression obtained on some later occasion or correlating the hypothesized determinant with the subjects past history of depression
An example of the first approach is a study conducted by Seligman Abramson Semmel Von Baeyer 
As predicted by the learnedhelplessness model depressed students made more internal stable and global attributions for bad outcomes than did nondepressed students suggesting that attributional style may be contribute to depression proneness
Of course a major shortcoming of this type of design is that one can not rule out the equally plausible proposition that attributional style is a consequence rather than a cause of depression Coyne Gotlib of an individual s current affective state with his or her tendency to become depressed
Although it is reasonable to expect that depression proneness would correlate with an individual s current affective state this relationship is far from perfect
Not everyone who is depression prone will be depressed during the assessment period and not everyone who is depressed will be equally depression prone
Klerman for example found that only of those diagnosed as neurotic depressives ever experienced another depressive episode during a fouryear followup
An example of the second approach is a study by Metalsky Halberstadt and Abramson 
These authors found that measures of attributional style taken before an important exam Time did not predict depressive moods in college students who had just received an unsatisfactory grade on their midterm exam Time but did predict depressive mood in these students two days later Time 
A major advantage of this approach over the first is that by adjusting for the effects of a significant correlation between the hypothesized determinant of depression proneness attributional style at Time and depression at Time n can be considered consistent with the proposition that attributional style predisposes to depression and inconsistent with the proposition that attributional style is merely a consequence of depression
However other problems remain
In using the subject s affective state at Time n as an indicant of depression proneness the researcher is in effect making an inference about the subject s tendency to become depressed based on a single observation and as Epstein has demonstrated inferences regarding behavioral tendencies that are based on single observations are apt to be high in measurement error and low in temporal reliability or replicability
The Metalsky et al
 results provide an excellent illustration of this point
If mood had been assessed at Time T but not Time T the attributional style hypothesis would have been fully supported
Conversely if mood had been assessed at T but not T An example of the third approach is a study by Silverman Silverman and Eardly 
These investigators assessed dysfunctional attitudes in patients with a history of depression when they were symptomatic and again when they were in remission
The logic behind this design is that if dysfunctional attitudes exhibited by the symptomatic depressives are still present when the symptoms of depression have remitted then these attitudes qualify as possible determinants of depressive vulnerability rather than as correlates or consequences of the depressive episode itself
However certain aspects of this approach can be problematic
As Lewinsohn Zeiss and Duncan have noted studies of patient populations are potentially biased by factors related to helpseeking behavior and treatment
Most depressed individuals do not seek or receive treatment Roberts Vernon Weissman Myers Thompson and those who are treated are likely to be suffering from more severe forms of the disorder Davies Blashki 
There is also the possible confounding of psychotropic medications that are typically prescribed for the remitted patients in these investigations Simons Garfield Murphy 
Another problem appears to be obtaining reliable diagnoses of depression
Some studies Corer Wittenborn Silverman Silverman Eardley report selecting their subjects according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria RDC or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSMII DSMIII but do not provide information about the training or interrater reliability of the interviewers making the diagnoses
Yet another problem with this approach involves dichotomizing individuals as depression prone or not depression prone on the basis of whether they have ever received a psychiatric diagnosis of depression
It would seem more appropriate to consider depression proneness to be a continuous variable and to develop more sensitive and stable measures of this variable
Lastly many researchers who want to investigate vulnerability factors or risk factors in depression can not use this approach because they simply do not have access to sufficiently large numbers of formerly depressed patients
Many if researchers had access to a psychometrically sound and economical measure of depression proneness
To this end Zemore has developed a measure of depression proneness that does not rely on current severity of symptoms or past diagnoses of depression
Instead respondents are asked to indicate the extent to which they experienced a variety of depressotypic symptoms over the past two years
Assuming that each subject s report is based on multiple observations of his or her affective reactions to a variety of situations over the past two years these selfreports should provide more direct more sensitive and more reliable measures of depression proneness than those used in past investigations
Additional advantages of this approach over some of those previously discussed are the ability to treat depression proneness as a continuous variable the ability to assess large numbers of individuals quickly and economically the ability to assess a variety of nonpatient populations and when used in conjunction with measures of current affective state the ability to statistically control partial out the influence of and other situational or personal variables of interest
The Depression Proneness Rating Scales DPRS were developed by Zemore and Zemore Bretell to assess an individual s tendency to become depressed The DPRS has three questions Compared to most people you know how often do you get depressed Compared to most people you know how long do your depressions last Compared to most people you know how deeply depressed do you become
Each question is accompanied by a point scale anchored at one end by the descriptor much less often much shorter or much less deeply and at the other end by the descriptor much more often much longer or much more deeply
The midpoint of the scale is described as about the same
The DPRS lists ten of the most commonly assessed symptoms of depression and asks the respondent to rate how frequently compared to others he or she has experienced these symptoms over the past two years
at one end by much less often and at the other by much more often
The midpoint is described as about the same
Zemore reported that student scores on the DPRS and an earlier version of the DPRS were significantly correlated with depressionproneness ratings given them by their parents and peers r 
The DPRS has also been reported to correlate negatively with interpersonal problemsolving skill r to Zemore Dell 
More recent studies have combined the DPRS and the DPRS into a single item scale referred to as simply the DPRS
Using a point scale for each item total scores on the DPRS can range from to with higher scores indicating greater vulnerability to depression
Zemore and Rinholm reported coefficient alpha estimates of reliability for males and females of and respectively
These authors also found that DPRS scores correlated with offspring reports of parental rejection and overcontrol independent of the Similarly Clair and Genest found children of alcoholic fathers scored significantly higher on the DPRS than children whose parents were nonalcoholic
Zemore and Bretell found that the DPRS correlated substantially with three personality measures that had previously been found to discriminate between remitted formerly depressed women and women with no psychiatric history r to 
Zemore and Veikle found the DPRS to correlate with the Beck Depression Inventory r with Lubin s Depression Adjective Checklist r and with Weissman s Dysfunctional Attitude Scale r 
The relationship between dysfunctional attitudes and depression proneness remained significant even after controlling for currentlevel depression
Thus evidence for the reliability and validity of the DPRS is accumulating
Several questions remain with regard to the psychometric properties of the DPRS
The present paper reports on three investigations that were designed to address some of these questions
Study assesses the stability of DPRS scores and their ability to predict between subjects DPRS scores and indices of clinical depression and Study investigates the factor structure of the DPRS
Subjects in all three studies were university undergraduates
Most were enrolled in introductory psychology courses at the time of the study
Participation was voluntary no external inducements such as course credit or money were offered
All subjects were debriefed immediately following their participation in the study
STUDY 
If the DPRS measures an individual s tendency to become depressed then respondents scores on the DPRS should be relatively stable over time and scores on the DPRS should predict future symptoms of depression
Method
One hundred men and women undergraduates completed the DPRS and the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory BDI both before and after the Christmas holidays
The testretest interval was approximately nine weeks long
The BDI is one of the most wellvalidated and commonly used measures of current severity of depression Bumberry Oliver McClure 
The short form consists of thirteen items from
High scores indicate greater symptom severity
Beck Rial and Rickels reported correlations of and between the long and the short forms of the BDI for groups of schizophrenic patients and suicideattempters respectively Results and Discussion
Our hypothesis that the DPRS scores would show relatively high testretest stability was confirmed
DPRS scores at Time were highly correlated with DPRS scores at Time nine weeks later r p 
As expected current severity of depression showed less stability with BDI scores at Time only moderately correlated with BDI scores at Time r p 
The difference between these two stability coefficients was statistically significant z p 
Thus the greater temporal stability of the DPRS relative to the BDI is consistent with our assumption that respondents are able to consistently assess their depressive tendencies and that these judgments are to some degree independent of the respondent s current affective state
depression was also confirmed
A hierarchical multiple regression analysis found that Time DPRS scores accounted for a significant increase in explained variance in Time BDI scores beyond that explained by Time BDI scores R change F p 
We should point out however that our measure of future symptoms of depression was based on a single observation Time BDI scores and as mentioned earlier a single observation is not a reliable indicator of how an individual characteristically behaves Epstein 
A better test of our hypothesis would have been to correlate DPRS scores with the incidence of depressive symptoms at several points in time and in a variety of situations
STUDY 
If the DPRS is a valid measure of depression proneness then subjects who score high on this measure should be more likely to have a history of depression than subjects who score low
Method
To test the above hypothesis university students completed the DPRS the asked about past episodes of depression Have you ever been treated for depression by a psychologist psychiatrist or other professional counsellor Have you ever attempted suicide Have you ever had a depression for which medications were prescribed Have you ever been hospitalized for depression
Each of these items was answered on a point scale never once twice three or more times 
Of the respondents reported being treated for depression by a professional counsellor had attempted suicide had a depression for which medication had been prescribed and had been hospitalized for depression
Students who fell into any of the above categories were classified as having a history of depression n 
The remaining students were classified as having no history of depression n 
Results and Discussion
Our hypothesis that the DPRS would discriminate between correlation between history of depression present vs absent and DPRS scores r p 
The relationship between history of depression and BDI scores was also significant r p but significantly smaller than the correlation between history of depression and DPRS scores t for the significance of the difference between dependent correlations p 
Thus the DPRS was found to be a better predictor of past depressions than the BDI as would be expected if the DPRs measures depression proneness and the BDI measures current severity of depression
It should be pointed out that because the DPRS is normally distributed and the incidence of past depressions is highly skewed the maximum possible value of r is severely restricted
If a nonlinear transformation is used to skew the distribution of DPRS scores so that the DPRS distribution more closely resembles the historyofdepression distribution then the linear relationship between these two variables is increased
For example squaring DPRS scores skews past depression from to 
Before leaving this section we should mention that both the DPRS and the historyofdepression measure were based on the subject s selfreport
Consequently we can not rule out the possibility that the observed relationship between the DPRS and history of depression is due at least in part to common method variance
Future research will have to develop more adequate measures of past depressive episodes independent of subjects selfreports in order to better assess the predictive validity of the DPRS
STUDY 
Another question that needs to be addressed regards the dimensionality of the DPRS
According to Nunnally items within a measure are useful only to the extent that they share a common core the attribute which is to be measured
In summing item scores to arrive at a total score it is assumed that each item adds something to the others and unless the items shared an
attribute it would not be meaningful to sum scores over items
Thus items which has a high average correlation with total scores and is dominated by one factor only Nunnally p 
The purpose of the third study was to determine the extent to which DPRS achieves this ideal
Method
Subjects were male and female undergraduates
Approximately half of the subjects completed the DPRS outside of class in small groups of five to fifteen
The remaining subjects completed the questionnaire during class time in groups of 
Results and Discussion
Cronbach s coefficient alpha estimate of the scales reliability was 
Correlations between each item and total score minus the item being correlated with the total score ranged from to with a mean of 
The magnitude of these itemtotal correlations suggests the presence of a single common factor
However for a more definitive assessment of the latent structure underlying the DPRS the matrix of item intercorrelations was factoranalyzed using principalfactor extraction with multiple R as initial communality estimates
Only one analysis
The scree test Cattell also indicated a single factor solution the eigenvalue for the first factor was more than eight times that of the second factor vs 
Factor I accounted for of the total variance
Table presents the item loadings for this factor
Note that all items loaded or greater
Analysis for males and females independently produced identical factor structures
For males the eigenvalues for the first and second factors were and respectively
For females the eigenvalues for the first and second factors were and respectively
In total the results show that the DPRS is unidimensional
A single score representing depression proneness therefore can be obtained by summing over all of the items
Results hold for both males and females
Further research however is needed to replicate the factor structure of the DPRS with populations other than university students
CONCLUSIONS
The results of the three studies reported here together with for the validity of the DPRS as a unidimensional measure of depression proneness
Consistent with the concept of depression proneness scores on the DPRS were relatively stable over time predicted symptoms of depression at Time independent of symptoms of depression at Time and were correlated with past indices of depression
The DPRS was also shown to be dominated by a single factor with identical factor structures for both males and females
Thus the DPRS appears to be an accurate and practical means of assessing depression proneness
However additional validation studies should be conducted using more adequate criterion measures to assess the predictive validity of the DPRS and sampling populations other than university students

PREFORMATTED TABLE
A total of nineyearolds were tested on reaction times providing reaction time RT parameters consisting of movement times decision times in simple choice and oddmanout tasks variabilities and also on a number of intelligence tests measuring the major primary abilities
Virtually all the reaction time parameters were significantly correlated with psychometric intelligence at a magnitude of around 
Factor analysis showed the existence of a general factor on which reaction time and psychometric tests were correlated In addition there were four primary factors of psychometric intelligence movement time reaction time and the oddmanout task
Broad similarities and some differences were found between the present results and those of a similar study by Buckhalt and Jensen 
INTRODUCTION
The discovery by Roth of a positive correlation between intelligence and the speed of reaction in choice reaction time tasks has generated considerable research exploring this relationship
In general subsequent work has confirmed that a significant association of the kind found by Roth Vernon Frearson Eysenck although there have also been criticisms of the claim Longstreth 
One of the significant developments in this field has been the breakdown of reaction times into four components which are generally designated movement time MT simple reaction time SRT choice reaction time CRT and the variability of reaction times as measured by the standard deviation of the mean or median on a number of trials RTSD
It has generally been found among adults that more complex reaction times eg choice RTs as compared with simple RTs and variability are more highly correlated with intelligence than are movement times and simple reaction times but among children these differences have not been so clearly established Jensen Munro Buckhalt Jensen 
The findings in several studies that variability of reaction times has the highest correlation with intelligence has led some commentators to propose that the the association between reaction times and intelligence Mackintosh 
A recent study by Buckhalt and Jensen makes an important contribution in this area by factor analyzing twelve parameters of reaction times and showing that three independent factors are present
They identify these as movement time reaction time ie speed of apprehension or decision time and variability of reaction times
The isolation of a variability factor supports the contention that variability is a distinct component of performance on reaction time tasks independent of reaction time as such and movement time
It was considered that the Buckhalt and Jensen result is sufficiently important to justify an attempt at replication and this was the first objective of the study to be reported in this paper
The second objective of the study was to examine the relationship between reaction times and the six major primary abilities originally identified by Thurstone consisting of reasoning verbal comprehension spatial numerical and perceptual speed and fluency abilities
Hitherto studies of the a general reasoning test of which Raven s Progressive Matrices has been the most commonly used
It is possible that some of the components of reaction times might be a function of one or more of the established primary mental abilities rather than of general intelligence Spearman s g
The most obvious hypothesis is that perceptual speed primarily is involved in reaction time tasks
We do not believe that this question has been investigated as yet
Method
The subjects were children boys and girls attending primary schools in small country towns and villages in Northern Ireland
All the nineyearolds in the schools were tested
The mean age was months standard deviation 
The Primary Mental Abilities Test For grades Thurstone was administered
This consists of five subtests that measure reasoning verbal numerical spatial and perceptual speed abilities
The test does not contain Thurstone s sixth major primary of fluency
Hence two fluency tests were given
These were to write Two minutes were allowed for each test and were scored for the number of acceptable words given incorrect spellings were accepted
Raven s Standard Progressive Matrices and Cattell s Culture Fair Test Scale Form A were also given to provide generally recognized tests of general intelligence or Spearman s g
In Cattell s terminology the Culture Fair Test is a measure of fluid intelligence
The reaction times were recorded with an apparatus described by Jensen and Munro 
It consists of a black metal box with the top side pitched at a degrees angle
On the top surface of the box is a cm radius semicircle of eight plastic inch microswitch pushbuttons which are lit from underneath
At the center of the semicircle nearest the subject is a black home button
Pressing the home button activates each trial which is programmed and timed by an Apricot microcomputer
Subject s data are recorded automatically on the working disk immediately after each trial
The apparatus stimulus light and release of the home button and movement time time between the release of the home button and depression of the response button
The consistency of response for reaction time and movement time is also measured as the standard deviation of responses across trials
Three conditions were employed in the reaction time experiment
In the first condition simple reaction time was measured
Only one of the lights was employed and the others were masked
Sixteen trials were given preceded by three practice trials further practice may be given if necessary
In the second condition choice reaction time was measured
All eight lights were employed
At each of the trials three practice trials one of the lights came on at random
The third condition involved the use of the oddmanout paradigm which was introduced by Frearson and Eysenck 
Thirty oddmanout trials six practice trials were presented in two blocks of trials with a rest of approximately one minute between them
buttons illuminated simultaneously and the subjects were asked to press the button which was farthest away from the other two ie the oddmanout
After the third condition another trials of the second condition were given
When errors occurred due to subjects pressing the wrong button the trials were repeated at the end of the block of trials in that condition
If errors recurred on repetition the trial was repeated until the correct response was made
In the first and second conditions trials were logged as errors where the RT was less than msec or greater than msec or where the MT was less than msec and greater than msec
In the third condition trials were logged as errors where the RT was less than msec or greater than msec and where the MT was less than msec and greater than msec
The following five measures were obtained from the reaction time trials movement times simple reaction time complex bit reaction time by the standard deviations
Median times were taken rather than means to reduce distorting effects of exceptionally fast or slow times
Results
Descriptive statistics giving means and standard deviations for all the reaction time measures are given in Table 
The first six variables are the mean medians mm
Each subject s median was obtained and the figure entered in the table is the mean of the medians
The second six variables are the intraindividual variations IV and consist of the standard deviations of the medians
The effect size is the sex difference expressed in standard deviation units using the standard deviations for the entire sample
Thus the largest sex difference is in movement time in the simple reaction time task The figure D indicates that the mean of boys is faster than that of girls by of a standard deviation
This is the only statistically significant sex difference
We believe that a difference of this kind has not hitherto been obtained most studies have not reported sex differences deviations for the intelligence tests are set out in Table
