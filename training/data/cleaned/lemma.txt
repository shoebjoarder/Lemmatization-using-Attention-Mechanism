lemma
life and letter
i do nt remember hear the phrase white guilt very much before the mid
grow up black in the s i never have the impression that white be much disturb by guilt when it come to black
when i would stray into the wrong restaurant in pursuit of a hamburger it do nt occur to me that the waitress be unduly trouble by guilt when she ask me to leave
i can see now that possibly she be but then all i see be her irritability at have to carry out so unpleasant a task
if there be guilt it be mine for have make a imposition of myself
i can remember feel a certain sympathy for such people as if i be victimize them by draw them out of a innocent anonymity into the unasked for role of racial policeman
occasionally they come right out and ask me to feel sorry for them
a caddymaster at a country club tell my brother and me that he be this white club and that we should try to understand his position put yourself in my shoe
our color have bring this man anguish and if a part of that anguish be guilt it be not as immediate to me as my own guilt
i smile at the man to let him know he should nt feel bad and then begin my long walk home
certainly i also judge him a coward but in that era his cowardice be something i have to absorb
in the s particularly the blackisbeautiful late s this absorption of another be cowardice be no long necessary
the line of moral power like plate in the earth have shift
white guilt become so palpable you could see it on people
at the time what it look like to my eye be a remarkable loss of authority
and what white lose in authority black gain
you can not feel guilty about anyone without give away power to them
suddenly this huge vulnerability have open have the power to step right into it
in fact black power all but demand that you do so
what shock me in the late s after the helplessness i have feel in the fifties be that guilt have change the nature of the white man s burden from the administration of inferior to the uplift of equal from the obligation of dominance to the urgency of repentance
i think what make the difference between the fifties and sixties at least as far as white guilt be concerned be that white undergo a archetypal fall
because of the immense turmoil of the civil right movement and later the blackpower movement white be confront for more than a decade with their willingness to participate in or comply with the oppression of black their indifference to human suffering and denigration their capacity to abide evil for their own benefit and in the defiance of their own sacred principle
the civil right bill that bestow equality under the law on black be also in have white society not be wrong there would have be no need for such a bill
in this bill the nation acknowledge its fallenness its lack of racial innocence and confront the incriminating selfknowledge that it have rationalize for many year a flagrant injustice
denial be a common way of handle guilt but in the s there be little will leave for denial except in the most recalcitrant white
with this defense lose there be really only one road back to innocence through action and policy that would bring redemption
in the s the need for white redemption from racial guilt become the most powerful yet unspoken element in america s socialpolicymaking process first give rise to the great society and then to a series of program policy and law that seek to make black equality and restitution a national mission
once america could no long deny its guilt it go after redemption or at least the look of redemption and do so with a vengeance
yet today some twenty many measure the gap between black and white be widen rather than narrow
a university of chicago study indicate that segregation be more entrenched in american city today than ever imagine
a national research council study note the status of black relative to white in housing and education have stagnate or regress since the early seventies
a followup to the famous kerner commission report warn that black be as much at risk today of become a nation within a nation as we be twenty year ago when the original report be make
i think the white need for redemption have contribute to this tragic situation by shape our policy regarding black in way that may deliver the look of innocence to society and its institution but that do very little actually to uplift black
the specific effect of this hidden need have be to bend social policy more toward reparation for black oppression than toward the much hard and more mundane work of black uplift and development
rather than facilitate the development of black to achieve parity be a good example have tend to give black special entitlement that in many case be of no use because black lack the development that would put us in a position to take advantage of them
i think the reason there have be more entitlement than development be along with black power the unacknowledged white need for redemption not true redemption which would have concentrate policy on black development but the appearance of redemption which require only that society in the name of development seem to be pay back its former victim with preference
one of the effect of entitlement i believe have be to encourage in black a dependency both on entitlement and on the white guilt that generate them
even when it serve ideal justice bounty from another man s guilt weaken
while this be not the only factor in black stagnation and regression i believe it be one very potent factor
it be easy enough to say that white guilt too often have the effect what exactly be this guilt and how do it work in american life
i think white guilt in its broad sense spring from a knowledge of illgotten advantage
more precisely it come from the juxtaposition of this knowledge with the inevitable gratitude one feel for be white rather than black in america
give the moral instinct of human being it be all but impossible to enjoy a illgotten advantage much less to feel at least secretly grateful for it without consciously or unconsciously experience guilt
if as kierkegaard write innocence be ignorance then guilt must always involve knowledge
white american know that their historical advantage come from the subjugation of a entire people
so even for white today for whom racism be anathema there be no escape from the knowledge that make for guilt
racial guilt simply accompany the condition of be white in america
i do not believe that this guilt be a crushing anguish for most white but i do believe it constitute a that be a thread in white life sometimes feel sometimes not but ever present as a potential feeling
in the late s almost any black could charge this vulnerability with enough current for a white person to feel it
i have a friend who have develop this activity into a sort of specialty
i do nt think he mean to be mean though certainly he be mean
i think he be in that hyperbolic era exhilarated by the discovery that his race which have long be a liability now give him a certain edge that white guilt be the true force behind black power
to feel this power he would sometimes set up what he call race experiment
once i watch him stop a white businessman in the man s room of a large hotel and convince him to increase his tip to the black attendant from one to twenty dollar
my friend s tactic be very simple even corny
out of the attendant s earshot he ask the man elderly and very dark man in a starched white smock that make the skin on his neck and face look as leathery as a turtle s
he sit listlessly pathetically on a straightbacked chair next to a small table on which sit a stack of hand towel and a silver plate for tip
since the attendant offer no service whatever beyond the hand out of towel one could only conclude the hotel management offer his lowly presence as flattery to their patron as a opportunity for that easy noblesse oblige that could reassure even the harried and weary traveling salesman of his superior station
my friend be quick to make this point to the businessman and to say that no white man would do in this job
but when the businessman put the single back in his wallet and take out a five my friend only sneer
do he understand the tragedy of a life spend this way of what it must be like to earn one s paltry living as a symbol of inferiority and do he ironically he have just spend the day try to sell a printing press to the black muslim for their newspaper mohammed speak be connect to the deprivation of this man and others like him
but then my friend make a mistake that end the game
in the heat of argument which until then have only be playfully challenging he inadvertently mention his father
this stop the victim cold and his eye turn inward
what about your father the businessman ask
my friend reply he have a hard life that be all
how do he have a hard life the businessman ask
now my friend be on the defensive
i know he do not get along with his father a bitter man who work night in a factory and demand that the house be dark and silent all day
my friend blame his father s bitterness on racism but i know he have not mean to exploit his own pain in this silly experiment
do nt know how to get out of the situation without lose face
now catch in his own trap he do what he least want to do
he give forth the rage he truly feel to a white stranger in a public man s room
my father never have a chance he say with the kind of anger that could easily turn to tear
he never have a freakin chance
your father have all the goddamn chance and you know he do
you sell print press to black people and make thousand and your father probably live down in fat city florida all because you be white
on and on he go in this vein use against all that be honorable in him his own profound racial pain to extract a flash of guilt from a white man he do nt even know
he get more than a flash
the businessman be touch
his eye become mournful and finally he simply say you he take a twenty dollar bill from his wallet and walk over and drop it in the old man s tip plate
when he be go my friend and i could not look at the old man nor could we look at each other
it be obvious that this be a rather shameful encounter for all concerned my friend and i as his silent accomplice trade on our racial pain tamper with a strange for no reason and the stranger then buy his way out of the situation for twenty dollar a sum that be generous by one count and cheap by another
it be not a encounter of people but of historical grudge and guilt
yet when i think about it now twenty year later i see that it have all the element of a paradigm that i believe have be very much at the heart of racial policymaking in america since the s
my friend do two thing that make this businessman vulnerable to his guilt that bring his guilt into man in touch with his own knowledge of his illgotten advantage as a white
the effect of this be to disallow the man any pretense of racial innocence to let him know that even if he be not the sort of white who use the word nigger around the dinner table he still have reason to feel racial guilt
but as disarming as this might have be it be too abstract to do much more than crack open this man s vulnerability to expose him to the logic of white guilt
this be the fivedollar intellectual sort of guilt
the twenty dollar required something more visceral
in achieve this the second thing my friend do be something he have not intend to do something that ultimately bring him as much shame as he be dole out he make a display of his own racial pain and anger
what bring him shame be not the pain and anger but his trading on them for what turn out to be a mere twenty buck
man s knowledge of illgotten advantage to give credibility and solidity to it by put a face on it
here be human testimony a young black beside himself at the thought of his father s racially constricted life
the pain of one man evidence the knowledge of the other
when the businessman listen to my friend s pain his racial guilt normally only one source of guilt lie dormant among others be call out like a neglected debt he would finally have to settle
a illgotten advantage be not hard to bear it can be mark up to fate until it touch the genuine human pain it have bring into the world
this be the pain that harden guilty knowledge
such knowledge be a powerful influence when it become conscious
what make it so powerful be the element of fear that guilt always carry the fear of what the guilty knowledge say about us
guilt make us afraid for ourselves and thus generate as much selfpreoccupation as concern for others
the nature the reestablishment of good feeling about oneself
in this sense the fear for the self that be bury in all guilt be a pressure toward selfishness
it can lead us to put our own need for innocence above our concern for the problem that make us feel guilt in the first place
but this fear for the self do not only inspire selfishness it also become a pressure to escape the guiltinducing situation
when selfishness and escapism be at work we be no long interested in the source of our guilt and therefore no long concerned with a authentic redemption from it
then we only want the look of redemption the gesture of concern that will give us the appearance of innocence and escape from the situation
obviously the businessman do not put twenty dollar in the tip plate because he think it would uplift black american
he do it selfishly for the appearance of concern and for the escape it afford him
this be not to say that guilt be never the right motive it be a very dangerous one because of its tendency to draw us into selfpreoccupation and escapism
guilt be a civilizing emotion when the fear for the self that it carry be contain a containment that allow guilt to be more selfless and that make genuine concern possible
i think this be the kind of guilt that along with the other force make the civil right bill possible
but since then i believe too many of our social policy relate to race have be shape by the fearful underside of guilt
black power evoke white guilt and make it a force in american institution very much in the same way as my friend bring it to life in the businessman
few people volunteer for guilt
usually others make us feel it
it be the expression of black anger and pain that harden the guilty knowledge of white illgotten advantage
and black power whether from militant fringe group the civil right establishment or big city political campaign know exactly the kind of white guilt of white guilt in which white fear for their own decency and innocence it want the guilt of white selfpreoccupation and escapism
always at the heart of black power in whatever form have be a profound anger at what be do to black and a equally profound feeling that there should be reparation
but a sober white guilt in which fear for the self be still contain seek a strict fairness the civil right bill that guaranteed equality under the law
it be of little value when one be after more than fairness
so black power make its mission to have white fear for their innocence to feel a visceral guilt from which they would have to seek a more profound redemption
in such redemption be the possibility of black reparation
black power up the ante on white guilt
with black power all of the element of the hidden paradigm that shape america s racerelated social policy be in place
knowledge of illgotten advantage could now be show and deepen by black power redeem themselves by offer more than fairness by offer form of reparation and compensation for past injustice
i believe this bend our policy toward racial entitlement at the expense of racial development
in one of the assurance senator hubert humphrey and others have to give congress to get the landmark civil right bill pass be that the bill would not in any way require employer to use racial preference to rectify racial imbalance
but this be before the explosion of black power in the late s before the hidden paradigm be set in motion
after black power racial preference become the order of the day
if this paradigm bring black entitlement it also bring the continuation of the most profound problem in american society the invisibility of black as a people
the white guilt that this paradigm elicit be the kind of guilt that preoccupy white with their own innocence and pressure them toward escapism twenty dollar in the plate and out the door
with this guilt as opposed to the contained guilt of need for quick redemption
black then become a mean to this redemption and as such they must be see as generally less than others
their need be special unique different
they be see exclusively along the dimension of their victimization so that they become different people with whom white can negotiate entitlement but never fully see as people like themselves
guilt that preoccupy people with their own innocence blind them to those who make them feel guilty
this of course be not racism and yet it have the same effect as racism since it make black something of a separate species for whom normal standard and value do not automatically apply
nowhere be this more evident today than in american university
at some of america s most elite university administrator have grant concession in response to black student demand black power that all but sanction racial separatism on campus black theme dorm black student union black yearbook believe administrator sincerely believe in these separatist concession
most of them be liberal who see racial separatism as wrong
but black student demand pull administrator into the paradigm of selfpreoccupied white guilt whereby they seek a quick redemption by offer special entitlement that go beyond fairness
as a result black student become all but invisible to them
though black have the low grade point average of any racial group in american university administrator never sit down with them and demand in kind that black student bring their grade up to par
the paradigm of white guilt make the real problem of black student secondary to the need for white redemption
it also cut administrator off from their own value which would most certainly discourage racial separatism and encourage high academic performance for black student
lastly it make for escapist policy
there be no difference between give black student a separate lounge and leave twenty dollar in the tip plate on the way out the door
what demonstrate more than anything else the degree to by this paradigm be their refusal to lead black student to tell them what they honestly think to insist that they perform at a high academic level and to ask them to integrate themselves fully into campus life
this mark the difference between selfpreoccupied guilt and the guilt of genuine concern where fear for one s innocence be contain
the former grant entitlement as a mean to easy innocence and escape from judgment the latter refuse the entanglement and blindness of selfconcerned guilt and out of honest concern demand black development
escapist racial policy policy where institution favor black entitlement over development because of a preoccupation with their own innocence have i believe a dispiriting effect on black
such policy have the effect of transform white from victimizer into patronizers and keep black where they have always be dependent on the largesse of white
this be make evident in a famous statement by president lyndon johnson at howard university in 
you do not take a person who for year bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say you be free to compete with others and justly believe that you have be fair
on its surface this seem to be the most reasonable of statement but on closer examination one can clearly see how it deflect the emphasis away from black responsibility and toward white responsibility
the actor in this statement you white do not take a person black be white black be the passive recipient of white action
the former victimizer be challenge now to be patron but where be the black challenge this be really a statement to and about white people their guilt their responsibility and their road to redemption
not only do it not enunciate a black mission but it see black only on the dimension of their victimization hobble by chain and cast them once again into the role of receiver of white beneficence
nowhere in this utterance do president johnson show black to run fast once they get to the starting line
this statement which launch johnson s great society have the two everpresent signpost of white guilt white selfpreoccupation and black invisibility
white guilt have influence many of america s racial policy toward a paternalism that make it difficult for black to find their true mettle or to develop a faith in their own capacity to run as fast as others
the most vivid example of this be the many form of preferential treatment that come under the heading of affirmative action a escapist racial policy i believe that offer entitlement rather than development to black
a preference be not a training program it teach no skill instill no value
it only make a color a passport
but the bad aspect of racial preference be that they encourage dependency on entitlement rather than on our own initiative a situation that have already lead many black to believe that we can not have fairness without entitlement
here one fall into orwellian doublespeak confusion i believe be a unspoken black doubt about our ability to compete that be cover over by a preoccupation with racial discrimination
since there be already law to protect us against discrimination preference only impute a certain helplessness to black that diminish our selfesteem
the selfpreoccupied form of white guilt that be behind racial preference always make us lower so that we can be lift up
recently pennsylvania state university launch a program that pay black student for improve their grade a c to c average bring and anything high bring 
here be the sort of guilty kindness that kill
what kind of selfrespect be a black student go to have as he or she reach out to take for c work when many white student would be embarrass by so average a performance what better way to drive home the nail of inferiority what more pavlovian system of conditioning black to dependency than shell out cash for grade here black student learn to hustle their victimization rather than overcome it while not all preferential treatment be this insidious but the same dynamics be always at work when skin color bring entitlement
i think effective racial policy can only come from the sort of white guilt where fear for the self be contain so that genuine concern can ultimately emerge
the test for this healthy guilt be simply a heartfelt feeling of concern without any compromise of one s high value and principle
but how can white reach this more selfless form of guilt i believe the only way be to slacken one s grip on innocence
guilt have always be the lazy man s way to innocence i feel guilt because i be innocent and guilt confirm my innocence
it be the compulsion to think always of ourselves as innocent that bind us to selfpreoccupied guilt
white in general and particularly those public and private insitutions not necessarily white that make racial policy must not be so preoccupied with their image of innocence or put another way their public relation of good intention
in racial matter where black be view simply as american citizen who deserve complete fairness and in some case developmental assistance but in no case special entitlement base on color
we need social policy that attack poverty rather than black poverty and that instill those value that make for selfreliance
the white message to black must be america hurt you badly and that be wrong but entitlement only prolong the hurt while development overcome it
selfish white guilt be really selfimportance
it have no humility and it ask for a unreasonable egotistical innocence
nothing diminish a black more than this sort of guilt in a white which to my mind amount to a sort of moral colonialism
we use to say in the s that at least in the south you know where you stand
i always think this be a little foolish since i do nt like where i stand there
but i think one of the thing we mean by this at the time be that the south have very liberating in a ironical sort of way
it mean there would be no entangling complication with white need
it give us back ourselves
the selfishly guilty white person be draw to what black least like in themselves their suffering victimization and dependency
this be no good for anyone black or white
by shelby steele
shelby steele be a associate professor of english at san jose state university
his book the content of our character a new vision of race in america will be publish this august by st martin s press
section life and letter
the prince of wales in his speech and book a vision for britain attack modernist architect for building they have put up in the postwar year in britain have arouse a uproar among architect
one writer in architectural review the leading british architectural journal even find the source of the prince s taste in the architecture of nazi germany
he reproduce some picture of new housing from a german publicity handout of and sure enough they show singlefamily home on their own little plot
because the nazi prefer singlefamily house to apartmenthome block he find a precedent for the prince
of course we find the same preference in pare lorentz s famous movie the city make for the new york world be fair in or in the book and article of the reformer clarence stein and lewis mumford advocate planned community of low density for family
and these be no nazi
but architect give the prince no take the prince to task for colonialism racism and imperialism because he like classical architecture and would prefer to see more classical element in contemporary building
in this storm of denunciation the prince can only find satisfaction in the fact that the ordinary people seem to agree with him and that his critic be hysterical
which raise a paradox how be it possible that modernist architecture which begin with deep social concern and one of whose theme be proper housing for worker to improve their lot now require a elitist defense argue that only properly qualify professionally train expert should discuss and criticize architecture how do a socially concerned architecture turn out to be condemn fifty year later as soulless bureaucratic and inhuman a critique that receive wide acceptance by ordinary folk who have enthusiastically and overwhelmingly applaud the prince s attack on contemporary architecture and by many architect and planner as well
it be in the thirties that modern idea in architecture first begin to filter back american return from europe begin to bring us news of the modern movement
some of them be mostly interested in the new strip down unornamented functional aesthetic form but others be more interested in house for worker
catherine bauer s modern housing have a great influence on concerned architect on planner and on the early public housing movement
she bring back picture of the new housing be build in europe by socialist or socially concerned government
we look at the picture with admiration
instead of the messy workingclass district we know in american city with their crowded building build right up in a wall against the street with their mixture of housing and store and pushcart and sign with their sidewalk crowd with pedestrian and horse there be not many car in poor area then we see simple block of building in modern style orient to catch the sun with ample space around each block
yet today these onceadmired building block for worker from germany and know when or under what regime they be build most people would prefer those individual home show in the nazi publicity pamphlet
and many architect would agree
moshe safdie in his book form and purpose show picture of israeli apartment complex on the hill around jerusalem build under a social democratic government
and he contrast them unfavorably with arab housing build without benefit of modernism or government concern for the poor or house law that guarantee subsidized and modern dwelling unit to the poor
in other word the product of architectural concern for the working class do nt evoke much admiration today
what seem in the s and early postworld war ii decade to be responsive to social need and indeed be responsive to social need as far as architect and planner and socially mind government could discern them at the time now seem to us inhumane soulless bureaucratic
it be a very upsetting development if we be concerned that architect take more account of social consideration when socially mind now appear to us pretty poor stuff
be we wrong then about what be good housing for the poor and be we right now and if our taste have change so radically be it possible that they will change again and that we be right then and be wrong now
consider a concrete example of how our taste and judgment about house for the poor have change since the thirties
there be a aerial photograph much reproduce in reformist book on housing and urbanism of one of our first housing project set in the midst of a sea of slum and tenement in brooklyn
we see from the air the endless grid of street line with unbroken housing
we can see in the middle of each block if we look closely something rather fuzzy the backyard behind the tenement of each block
in the middle of the photograph a dozen block have be clear away obliterate tenement and street and set on this white and empty site be line up the street grid as if to remind us that the original street grid be set down by soulless marketminded surveyor
these new house for the worker be site scientifically to catch the sun or for some other good reason that cause their designer to ignore the original street grid
around the building be a expanse of empty land which will be dedicate to playground and greenery
i recall as a socialminded and socialist youth look at this picture proud at what have be do worry about how long it would take to clear away the surrounding sea of slum
when that photograph be first publish the tenement represent the terrible past the housing project the future
we all know what housing project represent to us today
those old building if they have survive be now often more desirable not only to poor people but to middleclass people too
what explain this upsetting reversal of taste do we deal with simple designer idiosyncrasy a and brownstone of new york properly remodel of course to the housing that be build as part of a great social experiment that social experiment incorporate to the extent this could be do in the practical world of bureaucrat and financial limitation the thinking of socially concerned architect and planner
be it that we simply and irrationally love strong cornice stoop column heavy lintel strongly marked sill the occasional decoration that grace even the worker housing of the early twentieth century
if that explain the reversal of taste it would be irresponsible for us to prefer the old
but it turn out that many of the people for whom the subsidized public housing with plenty of open space be build also prefer the old
now we must avoid the mistake of explain people s preference for one kind of housing or another only because of difference in design
people with few choice do nt decide on the basis of design
if we be to ask them they might say the project delinquent family or that they can nt live near their mother or they would give some other reason that relate to the social composition of the project or the bureaucratic rule under which it operate
or if they prefer the project and many do we might find out that it be because it be comparatively so cheap because of its subsidy and not because of its design and more spacious surroundings
design be nt everything
but design do play a role not only in the distaste of presentday designer and architect and planner for the result of the socially concerned architect and planner of the past but in the preference of the people with limited choice who reject or accept them today
and so we have our problem why be it that the sophisticated intelligence of socially mind architect do nt produce satisfactory environment for those with the least choice even bad why be it as my example suggest that environment build by commercial builder try simply to make a buck as environment in their appeal to ordinary people now here be something one have to ponder
it be all too easy to understand why the environment create by anonymous architect on greek island in italian hill town in moroccan city be so much more attractive to architect and designer today than what either sophisticated modernist or postmodernists do
that problem be a familiar one and we have answer that be more or less satisfactory
the town grow organically over time in one traditional style with one major traditional building material it enclose a life define by a traditional culture
what result impress all architect and designer of whatever persuasion
in year of leaf through architectural book and magazine i have never yet see a picture of one of these mediterranean urban environment that be use to illustrate a bad environment
every architect or designer love them
it be only reformer who be unsophisticated as designer generally native who want to sweep them away because of crowd or dirt or limited air the building block that have become the uniform residence of people all over the world
so we understand well enough why these environment have become so attractive to us
we know why or can guess why even the modern displaced arab who do know about other way of building who can use a variety of material who have to build his housing fast rather than over century and who may want to accommodate car seem to build a better environment according to moshe safdie than the israeli government agency with their advanced westerntrained architect and designer modern standard uptodateness in all respect
for a architect to lose out to the arab or any other traditional builder of the vernacular housing of a traditional culture in the way of produce good housing be not so devastating after all we be up against all that traditional wisdom develop over the age
but to lose out to the commercial builder be another matter and one that can not make the commercial builder beat out the architectdesigner
the question be why and i suspect the answer will teach us more than we can learn from the mediterranean village or the other wonderful works of the vernacular builder
consider two far example of this competition between the commercial builder with no high ambition than to produce what will sell or rent and the sophisticated architectdesigner
the first come from england and it be the case of the town of sunderland a shipbuilding and coalmining town fall on hard time for some decade in which old housing have be clear away for new development in the decade since world war ii
england we should recall stand in the first few decade after the war at the forefront of plan internationally and at the forefront of europe in the provision of good housing for the working class
it be a mecca for anyone interested in good planning and in sensible replacement of house stock
the case of sunderland have be describe in a fascinating book by norman dennis of course go first and there seem to have be little opposition to clear it after all all those who lose their housing be guarantee new wellsubsidized modern housing
by the bad of the slum have be clear but central government money be still available for go far and planner select the area by their standard that should be level with the people rehouse in new modern flat
by this time the resistance be severe
why consider the house that be come down to be replace by modern flat
they be typical of the row house for worker of the dreary industrial town of england
these cottage as they be call in sunderland be build for the working class by unnamed builder one hundred year ago
many be rent but most be by this time own by their inhabitant
the house sit directly on the sidewalk
there be no tree on the street
there be no front yard
we floor and if there be a second as some have two more window
there be a tiny backyard with a brick outhouse
what could possess people to prefer these anonymous and styleless dwelling to new flat and one heavily subsidize to boot but if one look more closely one see that one facade have be stucco another leave in brick
one entry have a flat top another a arched one
some window have heavily mark lintel top and bottom
other have the lintel stucco over
at the end of one block in a unit identical to the others be the gardener s arm a pub
we can understand some of the reason why people prefer to stay and some of them have nothing to do with architect or designer
they have live there a long time
they have their friend there
they have their local store to shop in their church and chapel
all this would be hard to replace in the new area where the center of town with plenty of bus
in the new outlying area to which they would have to move there be fewer bus run infrequently
and even though i imagine none of us would think much of sunderland on a saturday night a center be still a center for convenience for liveliness
many of them own their own cottage and could do with them what they like and arrange them to their taste
they be no long crowd
but after all this the striking thing be that housing build with ostensibly no attention to personal taste and desire throw up to cover the most land and make the most money use the material and technology of the s be consider superior by many of those live in them to the new flat design by the best planning authority use good architect
imagine what the cooking bath and toileting facility of such cottage be
the wc s be typically out in the backyard and the cottage have no greek isle or the italian hill town it be ordinary workingclass uninspired housing and yet the resident prefer it
could they have be provide with something that give them the advantage of the old house they have and which eliminate the very striking disadvantage very likely
but we have some evidence that a taste for a proper modern style on the part of the architect make a close replacement impossible
the local authority be commit to flat
in discuss with the relevant officer the reason for choose flat as a form of development in sunderland the interviewer be tell that highrise block be essential to the skyline of the town
seven block of storied flat be build at gilley law on the outskirts of the town as a result of a aesthetic choice
""
the mind boggle at the thought of sixteenstory apartment house in sunderland where the top density of the area to be clear twostory house be only sixtyeight room per acre
most of the rehousing the resident still oppose that
so we can well understand why many of the people of sunderland prefer to stay in their old house and their old neighborhood
they even argue their disadvantage be advantage
the fact that the main window be right on the pavement they say mean more privacy
passerby do nt get the chance to look in they be past too quickly
""
we understand that everyone prefer a place of his own with his own front and backyard
we also understand that when we build at the high density of large city not everyone can have them
but consider a dense city such as manhattan
we find that even the commercially build housing of new york city that would appear on the face of it much less desirable than the sunderland cottage also have virtue that new housing could not provide
the plan for manhattan have be denounce by every sophisticated planner
as lewis mumford and others argue the checkerboard plan and avenue come at fixed interval each block be the same size and each could be reduce to the same property module for easy marketing no oddsized lots and module could be cumulate for large property size
and so the peculiar manhattan block with its long and narrow street side its short side on a wide avenue break into toolong building lots
the plan require no sophistication no diagonal street no adaptation to topography
and it turn out utilize it for commercial building require no sophistication either
the brownstone town house be invent for the upper middle class and put up by the thousand the tenement and other apartment house be invent for the working class and put up by the thousand
for grandeur a few lots be put together for the town house of fifth avenue and later for huge apartment house a halfblock or block in size on park avenue and on other avenue
no one have ever have a good word for this nondesign tear it down
then we discover that the brownstone provided wonderful living quarter even when it be break down to house a halfdozen or more family that the tenement once the severe overcrowding be overcome that be generally the single most serious problem in house for the poor also provide good living space
for a child grow up in these tenement there be really no serious problem except crowd
the street side of the tenement provided life variety play space around stoop even play space in the street before the traffic become heavy
marble could be roll along the curbside i be always mystify at how kid could play marble without a convenient curb along which to roll them
on the other side of the house be the quiet backyard
they even have tree
despite the crowding in the tenement these backyard completely surround by building that by law could not occupy the entire building space and cut off on all side from street and avenue be quiet
of the noise of manhattan if that is people be not play their radio
two kind of structure have replace them insofar as they have be replace for residential purpose rather than commercial and business purpose we have public housing project build tall to reserve the large amount of space for greenery and parking and to open up the apartment to more light and air and more crowded unsubsidized apartment house build on a huge scale compare to the old brownstone and tenement on large plot
the former reflect public decision partially unconstrained by market cost the latter represent market decision under a variety of constraint that be more severe than those that limit the early building
both i would argue have provide bad living quarter than be provide early
the story i have tell be not one confine to new york city
herbert gans in his wellknown book the urban villager describe the tenement of the west end of boston the area adjacent to be replace by tall modern apartment house
the house of the west end be quite similar to those in the tenement area of new york except that the building be somewhat low and small
if we look at the picture in the urban villager we find unit not very different from little italy in new york or the west village tenement
again once the overcrowding of poverty be overcome the people live there find their condition perfectly satisfactory indeed more than satisfactory
they resist fiercely be drive out of their home for new development for others
of course their satisfaction as be the satisfaction of the brownstone and tenement dweller of new york be not provide only or perhaps not even primarily by the design of their house
one must take into account that they have live there a long time and have their shopping place and church and friend and relative nearby
they also pay low rent for their old quarter
but i would insist that there be aspect of satisfaction they have one or three neighbor on a entry rather than twenty or thirty they be closer to the ground in three four and fivestory building and could watch their child at play or call to them they have enclose semiprivate open space not in this case for them individually of course but still space in the backyard that provide a different and quiet experience as well as public space which the towersinapark design of public housing as well as unsubsidized apartment tower could not provide
the point be not to praise the commercially mind builder who be of course concerned with cut cost to the bone and get the best return on his money
it be rather to force us to ponder the comparison between thoughtlessness and sophistication in design at the point where it should most favor the sophisticated to consider why private building for the incredibly poor worker of the past be superior to the public building of our more prosperous society for more prosperous people satisfaction seem to have be ignore by the sophisticated
they be cavalier about the characteristic and satisfaction of old neighborhood
they be all too ready to wipe away what exist and start with a clean slate many preferred to do this and object to the cost of retain some of the old and integrate it with the new
they be attach to form whether the high tower or the flat that look like factory or machine for live
it have be it be my impression not architect but their critic as well as resist homeowner tenant and resident of old area who have limit mass clearance and have spark as much rehabilitation as we have
it be not the architect who advocate rehabilitation though to my mind rehabilitation offer designer wonderful opportunity
most significantly designer fail to explore just what it be people find attractive in area and building for whose design characteristic not much if anything can be say
how often have we see those picture of endless levittowns little house lesson to avoid and how often have we contrast them to their disadvantage with gleaming vision of great tower let us put to one side for a moment the economic argument that require density and let us recognize that very often the density and overall cost of singlefamily home pack closely or lowlying apartment would compare favorably with twentystory apartment tower
i will not enter into the argument of comparative cost which be in any case complicate but we all know that study have show that the advantage be not always in one direction and that often a aesthetic choice to quote from the sunderland investigation a choice by either public authority designer or commercial builder dictate height
so let us go back to the contrast without worrying about the economics levittown on one side and on the other striking apartment tower and they have recently be strike indeed serpentine on the outskirts of paris inverted pyramid on the outskirts of rome or spiky concentration the architect or critic may have of the latter they be at least interesting
but let us look at the contrast ten or twenty year after they be complete
in levittown the tree have grow various type of fence wall in back and front yard some building sprout addition on top some on the side with the child go room be be remodel from bedroom to library and so on and so on
the apartment tower one suspect show no such opportunity for change
how could they since their resident have so little power over their environment the tree will grow and the landscaping perhaps improve if there be money for it but there will nt be much if people do nt see it as theirs
finally be i say the architect can nt beat levittown and that there be nothing to his skill his training his taste his occasional genius that make up for the ordinary crass effort to provide what people want can afford no i would not say that but rather that the architect have not try hard enough to find out what people like and like whether in old slum or new development and to see what his skill could do to satisfy build on and improve upon that even though there be some remarkable and admirable exception
i admit it be more fun to explore greek island and italian hill town than american slum and suburb but there be as much to learn in the latter as the former
wherever social scientist examine these thing they find a taste that architect on the whole do not find it interesting to satisfy a taste for the lowrise the small scale the unit that give some privacy some control some access to the ground a small piece of land wholly under one s control
i be not of course describe a universal taste
but for people raise child and indeed many others it be a near universal taste any reason to think that it be necessary or desirable that people be educate against that taste and develop a new taste for a large or gargantuan scale
on occasion condition seem to make what most people want impossible particularly in the very large city
new taste be develop and people find it be possible to adapt to tall block and great density many have and many more will have to
even when we adapt to such necessity there be thing to learn from how people live and use space that we have not yet learn
nor be i convince that the exigency of finance or the requirement of ordinance and law will make it impossible to provide environment people find more satisfactory
the sociologist considering what people like and what they find satisfactory be likely to appear a real spoilsport to architect and designer a rather glum soul who first tell us that they prefer their old building any old building to new one and secondly that even when you drive them out nice in something new it tend to be a homey fussy dowdy singlefamily house they prefer rather than sparkling tower of interesting shape or modernist structure of glass and aluminum
after all architect and designer want to soar both to build and design great thing new and not yet imagined thing and be we to confine them by what the ordinary man prefer and insist upon
well to begin with in a modern consumer society the ordinary man will eventually get what he want unless it be be provide by central government heavily subsidize and be give to him whether he want it or not as in the case of council housing block in england or public housing in the united state
in both country we be now dynamit the tall block that be once the admired model for family house only twenty or thirty year ago
but second the architect and designer can still soar because there be many more structure in the world than those require
after all historically the architect and designer have only soar when he build for the rich for the state for the church
he still can if these client will let him and in addition he now have a very substantial client who want thing big and striking the corporation rear its tower
not that he should or could ignore what people want in work environment or convening environment or even worship environment but everyone accept the symbolic role of such structure and one can break out without the need for a economical accommodation of need
and of course there be other way of soaring of build big and once again one think of the greek isle and italian hill town and moroccan city in which a organized approach to building add to bit by bit over time have create environment to which people cling and which delight the eye and soul of architect and designer
but if we be to expect the accumulation of smallscale environment virtue of the small scale to cumulate into grand structure and environment we probably need more change in our society than i can envisage
christopher alexander and his associate have make a heroic effort to establish such a way of building for our day in which more or less anonymous action produce large and substantial effect and it be a effort that must arouse our sympathy and awe even if we recognize its problem
perhaps there be still a way for the architect without become as so many modern formmakers have insist the dictator of a environment to provide a process a set of tool a mechanism whereby individual action can cumulate to great harmonious whole
but the only way of do that in the absence of dictator be through a steady and dedicated concern with how people live what they want what they find desirable and attractive and what they find troublesome and inconvenient
this have to be do before one build while one build after one build nt it delightful to put everyone into a great triangle or obelisk or a sphere have to collapse under this investigation so be it
we can always put it in drawing
little by little be i suspect in the modern world the answer not only in building but in public policy where many great scheme have come crash down
ponder his study of sunderland which he begin with the easy optimistic belief that welltrained planner and designer know best norman dennis be drive to another conclusion
he write
as edmund burke say in another connection the high level of satisfaction in area like the one schedule to be tear down be the result of a choice not of one day or one set of people

and again and finally of wisdom when we work only on inanimate matter surely they become part of duty too when the subject of our demolition and construction be not brick and timber but sentient being
the true lawgiver and i would add the architect and designer too ought to love and respect his kind and to fear himself

section life and letter
in the house of literature there be many anteroom
let be suppose for instance that we find ourselves in the most public of this stately house s room the parlor
while the great writer be busy work upstairs here mill around be the various people who play subsidiary role in that writer s life in one corner stand family member and close friend in another deep in conference be editor publisher agent also present be journalist photographer protege miscellaneous admirer and hangerson and perhaps take note in a alcove the writer s official biographer
after sample a canape or two you might gradually become aware of a particular undercurrent of noise drift through the room a ostensibly polite steady background hum
this be the hum of rumor and speculation about all the extracurricular detail crowd behind the solitary work of literary production
it be a hum generate by intense interest most often be the hum in short of the politics of literary celebrity
now to complicate this parlor game imagine that we be in this crowded room at a particular time the time say right after the great writer have die
the corpse and corpus lie in state elsewhere finish untouchable this be a room for the living and the changeable for murmur of genuine sorrow and transparent sycophancy for the complex messy business of sum up a life and put it in perspective
by the window near the table on which rest the sherry stand the person who preside over this scene
she be the person who have see to the decoration and cleaning of this parlor and the rest of the great writer s house have provide his inspiration raise his child type his manuscript offer critical advice protect him from excess publicity and nurse him through his last illness be now in a position to be the subject of this essay the writer s widow be nt this one of those subject that prurient biographer be always chew over insist that it shed light whether bright or dim on the author s work perhaps
but one reason to take a careful look at writer widow be that they themselves be a juicy literary subject
the very word widow be full of drama one think immediately of black lace mantilla of legacy and lawyer of hoarded letter and battle over access to them
one think of the small but compelling literary subgenre devote to tale about the wish to control a dead writer s reputation among them the aspern paper and pale fire
such a subject speak to the invariably interesting question of the durability of literary celebrity of the way a writer s work manage or fail to remain alive to the reading public after his death
sometimes though not as often as one might think this have something to do with the success of the author s widow in when i speak of the writer s widow as a general phenomenon one might naturally assume that i be think only of those dead author who be male
there have of course be notable literary widower as well leonard woolf and john middleton murry the husband of katherine mansfield come quickly to mind
there be all kind of widow and widower whom i will have for reason of length to overlook for example widow who have themselves have their own career in the literary world such as mary shelley or diana trilling or homosexual partner who have outlive their literary spouse or widow of man involved in art other than literature such as gertrud schoenberg or olgivanna the widow of frank lloyd wright
i have also overlook woman who perform many of the duty of wife and widow when they be in fact not marry to the writer in question one wellknown example be william wordworth s sister dorothy whose total dedication to her brother s personal and professional the poet s wife
literary biography have tend to provide a harsh view of the writer s widow
often perceive as a suspicious venal shrew argue endlessly over copyright and royalty she be traditionally malign as a stumbling block between the author s oeuvre and his adoring reader
and when she be not malign the writer s widow be satirize make to look ridiculous for her willingness to be attach nora barnaclelike to the underside of a author s career and then when that career be over to submit herself to the unrewarded task of preserve that career in the public imagination
probably the most famous example of this kind of satire be somerset maugham s cake and ale publish in 
although maugham at first vigorously deny it the book be widely recognize upon publication as a vicious portrait of thomas hardy who have die two year early and florence dugdale hardy his second wife
in the saturday review of literature xxj that if maugham do not intend his reader to be remind of hardy then he act with strange stupidity and a less stupid man than somerset maugham never set pen to paper
priestley go on nearly lick his chop at the prospect to anticipate a cheerful row
and he be not disappointed
review of cake and ale carry title that express the general outrage trample on thomas hardy s grave hit below the shroud grave profaned by literary ghoul
maugham of course delight in the notoriety and watch the sales figure for his book mount as the publicity increase
maugham s chief satirical objective in cake and ale be to expose the absurdly wide margin between the public s fantasy of a exalted writer s life and the vulgar even pathetic detail of that writer s existence
the great author in cake and ale edward driffield have be in his youth a rather seaside town of blackstable actually in hardy s case dorchester whose first wife a former barmaid have leave him for a bounder
driffield make it grandly as a novelist enter fashionable society and marry his young secretary amy who care for him until his death at the age of eightyfour
the book s narrator a young writer name ashenden who have know driffield and his first wife at blackstable when he be a boy describe driffield near the end of his life
he look a old old man hang on to mortality by a thread he wear very white false tooth and they make his smile seem forced and stiff
i have never see him but bearded and his lip be thin and pallid
he be dress in a new wellcut suit of blue serge and his low collar two or three size too large for him show a wrinkled scraggy neck
he wear a neat black tie with a pearl in mufti on his summer holiday in switzerland
it be as clear to reader in as it be today that all these detail add up to a fullscale attack on the wifely ambition of the second mrs driffield
maugham provide a quite horrible picture of helpless old age in which a weakened man be dress up like a mannequin to impersonate his philistine wife s notion of a famous author
that driffield in his former year have be a slovenly bohemian add of course to the cruel comedy of his absurd elderly nattiness
ashenden speak doubtless for maugham hardly bother to sheathe his claw in describe the driffields house ferne court furnish in the acme of good taste with a drawingroom decorate so exactly as you feel a drawingroom in a country house of modest size should be furnish that it be slightly disconcerting
here driffield entertain high society in the company of his neatlyturnedout wife so competent and discreetly manage
""
""
""
i wonder wonder if all this amuse him or if the amiable civility of his manner mask a hideous boredom
""
it be after the author die however that maugham s amy driffield come under heavy vituperative attack
rather than be condemn for neglect her husband s reputation amy driffield be mock far more cruelly for her diligence in protect it
she play the role of widow as gamely and as unimaginatively as she have play at be driffield s wife
when a campaign be launch to bury the author in westminster abbey ashenden note mrs driffield send a dignified letter to the press in which she express her confidence that she be carry out the dear wish of her dead husband in have him bury among the simple people he know and love so well
this be maugham s opportunity to portray amy driffield as a perfectly correct and perfectly insufferable snob for ashenden continue unless the notability of blackstable have very much change since my day i do not believe they vastly i afterward learn they have never be able to abide the second mrs driffield
""
toward the end of the novel ashenden go to ferne court to visit with amy driffield
in his description of her life here as the high priestess of the dead author s cult maugham s cruelty reach its apex
the scene be perfectly set note ashenden
i do not know why the room seem so strangely dead it have already the mustiness of a museum
ferne court s drawingroom shout decorum at ashenden in much the same way as its study have urge preservation
it suit the widow of a distinguished man of letter almost more than it have suit the wife
those chintzes those bowl of potpourri those dresden china figure there be about them a faint air of regret they seem to reflect pensively upon a past of distinction
the novel end with ashenden go to visit driffield s seventyyearold first wife rosie live in of all place yonkers new york
at this point maugham s satirical tone end and a strange perverse sort of sentimentality take over as ashenden reflect on the lusty life of rosie with whom he have himself long ago be in love
as a final behindtheback slur on amy driffield s character maugham portray rosie as much more authentic vibrant and inspirational to driffield than be his boringly sedulous second wife
when cake and ale first appear thomas hardy have be dead for two year he be eightyseven when he die florence hardy his widow be fiftyone
maugham claim to have meet hardy on only one occasion at the end of hardy s life but there be no question in florence s mind that maugham be parody her life as hardy s widow
it must have pain her in to note the novel s detail about her life that be false but no doubt it be much more painful
for my discussion of florence hardy i have rely on michael millgate s biography thomas hardy oxford university press mr millgate s introduction to the life and work of thomas hardy by thomas hardy university of georgia press and the second mrs hardy by robert gittings and jo manton heinemann 
""
to appreciate the difficulty of florence s widowhood it be necessary briefly to rehearse the story of her marriage to hardy
florence dugdale have meet hardy in the reading room of the british museum while he be still married unhappily to his first wife emma
what very strange marriage literary man seem to make write fanny stevenson after a visit to emma and thomas hardy this from a woman whose own marriage to robert louis stevenson be itself far from conventional
a former schoolteacher with a humble family background who be now dabble in journalism florence agree to act as hardy s secretary and become gate locate just southeast of dorchester
hardy fall in love with florence and woo her for seven year behind emma s back
when emma die in florence lose no time in move secretly into maximum gate
she and hardy be soon married which create a minor scandal
all be not bliss
hardy begin perversely to develop a enormous crush on the dead emma or more exactly on his idealized memory of her
he begin to write a series of his lovely poem dedicate to happy reverie about their early marriage and to his huge sense of loss
so it happen as robert gittings and jo manton have observe in the second mrs hardy that florence once hardy s coveted unavailable love replace emma the alltooavailable wife while poor dead emma with hardy marry to florence now become the unavailable love object
somewhat less than perfect though florence must have find this situation it appear that she go along with it without much fuss more to contend with than the ghost of her husband s first wife
there be conflict galore begin no later than the funeral
hardy s friend sydney cockerell whom hardy have name with florence as joint trustee of his estate have arrange for a ceremonious burial at westminster abbey just as maugham have write in cake and ale
yet hardy have request that he be bury with his family in stinsford churchyard near the house where he be born
to florence s acute dismay a rather gruesome compromise be reach
hardy s remains be duly cremate and inter in poet corner at westminster abbey but not before his heart be remove from his body and transfer to stinsford where it be bury during a second funeral service
feeling understandably that she have be push by cockerell and his coconspirator the playwright james barrie into make these unsavory if not to say grisly burial arrangement florence hasten to establish her dominion over hardy s literary remains
she patiently type and retype the manuscript of hardy s autobiography while he be alive she be not easily go to give up her right to control the publication of her husband s works now that he be dead
that same year she rush into publication a first volume of the autobiography change hardy s firstperson narrative into the third person and claim that the book be actually her own biography of her husband
but the narrative be largely hardy s as he have mean it to be for he have intend this book to stand as the authoritative record of his life
florence s claim to authorship be not entirely a fiction however for she delete nearly all of her husband s affectionate reference to his first wife emma and make some lengthy addition of her own addition that as michael millgate have say either have be or would have be reject by hardy
from the text and from that of the second volume publish in and her help with hardy s writing as well as his wishfully fabricate story about emma s friendship with florence in the year before emma s death
with equal thoroughness florence burn every trace of emma s former presence at maximum gate destroy two locked boudoir full of her clothes her paper even allegedly her old corset
so much for emma
now florence try to rid herself of her cotrustee cockerell whose idea for erect grand public statue of his friend deeply offend her sensibility
the two executor quarrel bitterly cockerell call florence a inferior woman with a suburban mind shade of amy driffield and florence try unsuccessfully to give up her trusteeship
each begin to act behind the others s back
in florence privately print a forgotten story of her husband be without consulting cockerell while in he take part in reconsecrating a church as a memorial to hardy a occasion to which florence be not invite
meanwhile the review that begin praise the author s wife for her discretion
florence set herself up at maximum gate as the overseer of hardy be one true memorial the museum that maugham describe with such malicious accuracy
but this be not the end of florence hardy s story as it be amy driffield s
without know it florence have be marry to a man of substantial wealth
when hardy die his estate be value at more than pound and his royalty and copyright be worth a fortune
accustomed to run her household on a shoestring florence now find herself in a position to act on some of her ambition to own a car to travel and to have a flat of her own in london
she choose a flat in the same house in which hardy have once work a block from the residence of sir james barrie
when her longestablished acquaintance with this friend and admirer of her husband s be rekindle in the city florence poignantly mistake barrie s neighborly affection all in his early seventies the age hardy have be when they married and he seem to need look after for the strange childlike author of peter pan be frequently in poor health
florence have be hardy s nurse for year before he die it be natural for her to want to assume the same duty for barrie
there be no way florence be ever go to become lady barrie no matter how many fond hope she may have cherish
for barrie have not to put too fine a point on it a thing for the wife and widow of famous man he like to flatter them even to give them large gift of money but he never intend or allow his excessive attention to flower into intimacy
when this become painfully clear to florence she pack up her thing and go back to maximum gate
she be force to conclude that in the eye of london literary society in general and in the mind of sir james in her great dead husband and someone regard as wholly uninteresting in her own right
florence spend the last year of her life entertaining american academic pilgrim at maximum gate support a local hospital and serve as hardy once have as a borough magistrate in dorchester where she work to improve child welfare and lowcost housing
when she die in at the age of fiftyeight her ash be bury next to hardy s grave in stinsford churchyard
as hardy s widow florence manage to accomplish little in the shaping of his reputation or the publication of his works
that he remain one of the bright light of english literature be true largely because the works poetry and novel that be so famous in his lifetime continue to speak to reader sixty year after his death
in most biography of hardy florence be mention as only a peripheral figure
except as the author of his biography she rarely appear in index of scholarly study
of course she survive ale in which maugham gleefully record her unimaginative taste her grim decorum her curatorial zeal
whether she behave the way she do because of the demand of her milieu despite the rather daring circumstance in which she and hardy be married she otherwise operate within the complacent convention of edwardian middleclass english life or whether she be incapable of be anything other than the stubbornly loyal protective undemanding soul she be one can not say
patience hardy have write in tess of the durbervilles be that blending of moral courage with physical timidity
but if ever a widow have be penalize for behave exactly as convention dictate that widow be florence dugdale hardy
be hardy s widow be at best a mixed blessing at bad a thankless task
hardy could have be speak for his wife when he write in his bitter poem title hap of the purblind doomster casualty and time who can just as arbitrarily sprinkle while cake and ale have be consider a eminently capable if cruel representation of florence hardy it would take a novelist far more powerful than maugham to capture the drama of countess tolstoy s predicament after her husband have die
in its largeness not even cecil b demille could have capture it
for the tolstoy do everything on a scale as spectacular as the history of their huge crumbling country and die be no exception
it be hard to imagine today when it be so easy to be famous merely for be well know the exact nature and scope of the tolstoy fame at the time of leo tolstoy s death at astapovo in 
around that bleak wintry train station be gathered swarm of photographer journalist chief disciple of the tolstoyan philosophy and member of the great man s family who have charter a special train to take them there
conspicuously present be that symbol of modern celebrity the steadily whir pathe movie camera
in the middle reach its end
sonya tolstoy be not allow to see her husband until he be nearly dead for it be think that the sight of her would hasten his death
the chief reason the eightytwoyearold tolstoy have take flight from his estate at yasnaya polyana be that he could no long endure the increasingly titanic battle with his wife of fortyeight year
she have bear him thirteen child patiently copy his manuscript as he write them she copy war and peace seven separate time and he follow her advice to publish the novel himself in six volume work side by side with him in the field during a countrywide famine manage his estate and farmland no small task especially after tolstoy decide to renounce all his interest in property and faithfully if uncomprehendingly stand by him as he undergo the lengthy philosophical conversion that foster a worldwide cult
by the time the aged ailing tolstoy make his escape sonya remind him of every materialistic tie to the world from which she would not subscribe to some of his most cherished belief would not become a vegetarian or resolve as he do to live the simple life of a peasant
meanwhile sonya not without cause be look for some financial recompense for her longterm endurance
she fight and lose a epic battle over the copyright to tolstoy s works over the right to publish his diary and over his will of which many draft be make and which put his literary estate in the hand of his chief disciple the relentless and secretive vladimir chertkov and tolstoy s daughter sasha who be chertkov s main collaborationist
sonya be not about to let all of this happen without some fireworks she scream she spy she cajole she threaten she even make at least one suicide attempt
tolstoy simply want to be leave in peace
one of his most famous tolstoyan principle be the renunciation of all property and he could not understand why his copyright and be not as detach from the battle as he pretend
his wife be the one person who could torture him as he be torture her
finally after many agitated year when both husband and wife be halfmad with anger he make his desperate illfated escape to astapovo
at last a few hour before tolstoy die it be decide that sonya should be permit to see him
for a description of the scene that read like a passage from a novel by tolstoy himself it would be difficult to match that of henri troyat from his wellknown biography
she stop short sway in the doorway of the room not dare to go near her husband in front of all these people who hate her
from the doorway she look at the skeletal little old man with the cavernous cheek and white beard who be all the love of her life
at last she make up her mind and walk straight up to the bed kiss her lyovochka on the forgive me
but he do not hear
the funeral train that carry the body of tolstoy back to yasnaya polyana for burial require two car one for tolstoy and one for all the journalist photographer and newsreel cameraman who be record the event
four thousand people meet the train at the tolstoy estate
the open coffin be put on a table in the house so that mourner could file through to pay their respect
meanwhile there be demonstration throughout russia the incendiary spirit already in the air be fuel by memorial for the writer who have believe so passionately in revolution
as a xxn wilson point out in his recent biography tolstoy seven year after tolstoy s death when lenin s revolution break out such be the association in the world s mind of tolstoy with revolution that the western press erroneously describe the event of as a tolstoyan revolution
this be fame on a nearly unprecedented scale
if there be no shortage of public grief from a bad conscience for one thing
there be many who believe sonya tolstoy be seriously mentally ill by this point whether or not this be true it be nonetheless clear that her remorse and her guilt be real she believe that she be responsible for her husband s death
a month after the funeral she write in her diary have put away husband s thing to protect them from moth
""
""
""
it be a torture to go on living
she tell her daughter tatyana that she think incessantly about tolstoy and add i treat him badly and it be a torment to me
""
""
""
surprisingly sonya now go so far as to become a vegetarian as her husband have wish
by all account she behave in a mild kind distract way to everyone at the estate as if her former obstinacy have be crush by grief
but as tatyana tolstoy the writer s daughter have write of what people would say and write about her when she be go she fear for her reputation
as a result she never let slip the slight opportunity of justify her word and action
there be no weapon she would not use in her campaign of selfdefense she be ward off in advance the attack she know one day would be make upon her
and she know by whom
whom mean chertkov and his band of tolstoyans sonya s sworn enemy
he along with sasha tolstoy be now in control of tolstoy s literary right and publish works
sonya still retain legal possession of yasnaya polyana but tolstoy have wish sasha to buy it from her mother and then turn it over to the peasant
in sasha buy the estate for four hundred thousand ruble give twothirds of it to the peasant
sonya keep of the original acre
the year before her house in moscow be sell to the government with the request that it be make into have establish be no long allow to produce tolstoy s works
to make matter bad tolstoy s other child blame their mother for allow tolstoy to leave everything to sasha
most likely tolstoy have not really intend to torture his wife by exclude her from his will but only wish her to convert to the tolstoyan faith and renounce her desire to own property
yet the practicalminded sonya regard this understandably as monstrous that her husband expect her not only to raise his child handle his huge estate and social world but also to be a perfect tolstoyan in word and deed be truly amazing
all the same she feel guilty for her failure and it seem that everybody around her blame her for her husband s desperate end
the countess stop write in her diary shortly after tolstoy die claim that what be of importance be the past and anything concerning the memory of tolstoy
she insist that the money from the estate sale to sasha be divide among her a pension bestow by the tsar
continue to preside quietly over the main house at yasnaya polyana she keep everything as it have be while tolstoy be alive
outside the peasant run amok with their new wealth begin to chop down the large forest around the estate while the impervious sonya see that everything be in order at the house
her relative calm after so many year of sturm und drang appear to her child to be a sign of dementia
it seem no one be ever again go to remember her as anything other than a madwoman whether a raving or a subdued one
when world war i begin sonya ignore the brief wave of patriotism that sweep the country as russia enter the war
she live almost completely in her memory
she have nearly lose her eyesight by the time the bolshevik take power and helpless she fear a ambush
but the peasant stand guard and protect her through that long summer of 
during the widespread of it be still serve at yasnaya polyana by sonya s whitegloved valet at the end of the year however the government take over the estate to transform it into a farming collective
ironically when stranger move into the house to organize the collective sonya s treacherous daughter sasha return to become the collective s chairman
sonya be now in the humiliating position of have to ask for everything she need from the daughter who have already agree to divest her of her proper inheritance
sonya do not surely she could not live through these precarious time for much long
she die of pneumonia as tolstoy have in at the age of seventyfive have live through four tsar two famine several war and revolution
food be scarce around the time of her funeral so her many fine old clothes be immediately sell to buy flour for the farming collective
eight year after tolstoy have die sonya be say to have remark i live really learn what kind of man he be
this be a astonishing statement but it be not hard to believe if one know anything at all about tolstoy s conflictridden quixotic messianic nature
yet there can be little doubt that she love him greatly love him even through her hatred of him through all her doubt about his philosophizing and through his ghastly treatment of her
it take a extremely competent highly intelligent hugely energetic woman to meet the demand of marriage to count leo tolstoy and sonya tolstoy be all of these thing
where florence hardy rise from undistinguished origin and try hard to fit into the role of mrs hardy sonya educated and aristocratic know from the beginning how to be countess tolstoy
she be a endlessly capable utterly manipulative woman much more complicated than the simple florence and her effusive suffering with all imperial russia crash down in the background seem much more grandiose
yet there be aspect of be countess tolstoy that as much as she fear her reputation be slander after she be dead she love the glamor of know she have be the wife of a genius of be unprecedentedly famous
she be cut out to play her role and she play it with great flair
in a sense sonya tolstoy be widow twice for the ingenious writer with whom she have fall in love have die figuratively around when tolstoy abandon the art of fiction for more lofty philosophical and religious pursuit
the first tolstoy the artist have be far more tolerant than the second and the demand he make of his wife copy his manuscript and advise him about their publication she have be only too happy to meet for she understand and revere his genius as a novelist
she be proud of her indispensability to tolstoy at that time when there be not yet any disciple snoop around steal her lyovochka s love and attention there have be only tolstoy his work his wife be no more marvelous novel only rambling philosophical tract that be all but incomprehensible to sonya there would be the inscrutable chertkov take over the role of chief helpmate to the the master and there would be the endless terrible battle between husband and wife who each long for the predicament to end but who could not until the end tear away from each other
she will remain a millstone around my neck and round the child be till i die tolstoy write in his diary in 
""
if sonya s power over her husband s literary life expire when tolstoy renounce literature and resolve to become a saint her power over him in the second phase of his career though threaten be alive in a complex way and shape by their long year together it be a power that exist beyond mere copyright and will which bind them together through the mutual torture session that become ultimately their marriage
tolstoy have write in war and peace as pure and complete joy
the tolstoy marriage be a mixture of luxurious even epic portion of sorrow and joy
when tolstoy die both the exhilaration of battle and the torment of love be dead to sonya tolstoy
one aspect that all literary widow seem to share be a element to a great or lesser degree of theatricality or roleplaying as though in rise to meet the occasion of widowhood they find it necessary to enhance their personality
while sonya tolstoy s role as countess amount to a star turn in nearly every other widow of a famous writer one can detect similar dramatic instinct
in the year after edmund wilson die according to his daughter rosalind wilson s widow elena be describe by friend as dash about be very much madame lexecutrix and have a happy social time

i have much rather be receive some royalty from his book than be the widow of a immortal
""
one literary widow come to mind whose roleplaying be not a theatrical pose but a matter of survival to whom profit from royalty and copyright be for decade completely irrelevant since anyone could be arrest merely for distribute and certainly for publishing her husband s work
as late as in russia there be not yet available a proper edition of her husband s works
nadezhda mandelstam widow of the russian poet osip mandelstam take it upon herself to keep his name alive to become a human library of his work through a lifetime of indescribable repression and abuse
it would not be extravagant to claim that she be the most heroic literary widow in modern history
anybody who have read mrs mandelstam s twovolume memoir hope against hope and hope its excruciating detail
osip mandelstam who along with pasternak be regard as the greatest twentiethcentury russian poet could not bear to watch the stunning repression of artistic and personal freedom that terrorize the country after stalin take control of the soviet union at the end of the s
through his poetry mandelstam openly challenge the regime by ask if certainly not for death then plainly for exile in the poem denounce stalin that lead to his arrest he write rather stuff me like a cap in the sleeve of the siberian steppe warm furcoat
he be arrest on may 
he die at the end of the year in a transit camp near vladivostok
the exact date and circumstance of his death be still uncertain
after hint of her husband s death reach nadezhda mandelstam she live as a fugitive always one step ahead of arrest
during world war ii she manage to get to tashkent where she somehow earn a university degree and be certify as live be her determination to preserve the memory of mandelstam and his poetry in fact for her poetry and mandelstam come to mean the same thing and when he be condemn to death so in her view be the fate of poetry condemn
many of his poem she do not venture even to write down for fear of far persecution
instead she learn them by heart
mandelstam himself have make her memorize his autobiographical fourth prose as he dictate it to her no doubt with a premonition of his own fate
in the s and early s mrs mandelstam s twovolume memoir circulate in russia in samizdat the underground method of distribute unpublished work in typescript and be publish abroad in translation
she give away all the royalty she receive to her friend proud that after decade of homelessness fear and poverty she be finally in a position to offer assistance to others
at this time she be at last permit to live in moscow where she and have the luxury at last of openly play the role of the great poet s widow
often in the tiny kitchen of her apartment there be a crowd of people wait to see her stand patiently as if in line for bread in a bakery
during the thirty year between the time osip mandelstam die and the time of mrs mandelstam s bitterly triumphant return to moscow she witness event that one would think be beyond the power of language to relate
even so perhaps the most shocking aspect of her memoir be her insistence that her story be totally unremarkable
if the police do not find me she write in hope abandon it be because i be like a needle in a haystack a infinitely small particle one of ten of million of wife of man send to the camp or kill in the prison
some woman she claim have even less than the scant information she be able to obtain about the detail of their denisovich be a resort compare with the camp others describe to her
think about mandelstam existing in such a camp be a agony to her
something like relief come to her when she know his suffering be over
when i hear that m have die she write i stop have my nightmare about him
""
thank god that people be mortal nadezhda mandelstam write in hope against hope
the only reason one could have to go on living be to remember it all and later tell the story
and in hope abandon she go on the reader be the final arbiter and it be for him that i keep mandelstam s poetry and it be to him that i have hand it over

if the verse i have preserve be of some use to people then my life have not be waste
""
nadezhda mandelstam die on december 
far from have waste her life of preservation
in many sense she nearly become her husband she adopt what have often be call his inner freedom his defiance and his determination and more prosaically as i be not the first to point out she adopt his style and language in her book
i think there be no great miracle than time and the phenomenon derive from it memory she once write
as we know only too well history be constantly be falsify right in front of our eye
what great devotion could a widow display toward her husband than perform this miracle of memory for so many year and at such enormous risk where i have be concern up to this point with the degree to which author widow have manage to control their husband reputation here be a case in which a widow through sheer heroism be her husband s reputation no less and be the sole reason we be privileged to know and appreciate a conclusion to be draw a common thread to be tie around the story of these very different woman with their vastly different history who seem to share only the fact that they each live with a husband who be also a literary genius they all wanted sovereignty over their husband work though only one nadezhda mandelstam obtain it at a risk that might easily have cost her her life
other than that fact the only thing these widow have in common be the malignant way in which their predicament seem habitually to be satirize in the public imagination
florence hardy s suburban mind sonya tolstoy s opera buffa doorslamming at yasnaya polyana even as some have characterize her at the end of her life nadezhda mandelstam s selfparody of a terminally irascible old crone despite all their effort these be the way author widow be most often destine it appear to be portray
yet as i start to read more about the life of
for who would not after selfless year of coddle and care for a difficult man long for a bit of power over his estate for a bit of public recognition of her own who would not resent be judge as inconsequential as soon as the primary reason for her celebrity have be take away from her and who could not resist the pleasure of serve as high priestess to worshipper wish to pay their respect these caretaker of the house of literature while they create no art of their own in many thankless way encourage its production and protect it as they think best
whether their compensation be worth the price be a question i or perhaps anyone else can nt presume to answer
by donna rifkind
donna rifkind s review have appear in the wall street journal the new criteria and the american scholar
section life and letter a memoir
it be the end of the day and the end of the summer
we sit a family gather on the screenedin porch look out over the lake
a afternoon storm have just pass and as the evening sky clear in the west the sinking sun catch the cloud still lower overhead and suddenly the air about us be bright with gold a fair shimmering that glow on the lake and the yellowing birch and even touch our face with a radiance not our own
we be stricken with the sudden glory our voice rise and fall in quiet fluttering of delight like doze bird rouse in our evening tree
wonder exhaust our word and we fall into silence
a moment to remember i tell myself as long as i live
tomorrow some of the family will leave and in a few day my wife and i will close the cabin for the winter
but for now my infant grandson sit perfect and undiscriminating curiosity that be the privilege of a innocence so lately rock in fetal water
his face glow in the golden light
i no innocent return his regard with a interest less pure as i seek in his placid feature some resemblance to my own
i be his mother s father but in him i see mainly sign of his father s family my daughter s eye perhaps which while not my own seem reminiscent of others in my family
it be a old delusion that pass quickly
what comfort for my decline in some blurred impress of myself on my posterity indeed through the intervening embrace of passion the liquid exchange of love what dilution of my dna could still work its way in his vein write my message in his tender flesh what he find in my face i can not guess
the sun settle low and i be in shadow
we have be look at a book together while the family murmur and soft cheek have be nestle against my chest as i point to the bright picture and prompt his talk ooh
""
""
and what be this big animal he look and jab the elephant with a moist finger and attack the problem of speech with sound that will soon be shape to a language i know
but restless now he turn his gaze from the book to my face then with motive i can not fathom he slip off my lap and with spraddled leg and sag diaper lurch away through the golden light
with a sudden catch at my heart i find myself brim with love and vague premonition
old bone not my own stir softly inside me
how i wonder might my mother s father have ask these question and his lineage before him i have think sometimes of those movie scene in which the scion of some great family pace the portrait gallery of his ancestor where generation upon generation recede from the brightly lighted present toward line be to halt at the edge of this century the ocean and a unknown tongue
across the gulf of history geography and language my people can not speak to me and in my mind s eye be no receding gallery but only the brief reach of childhood memory
in the foreground stand my mother whose voice i know in the middle distance my grandfather whose voice i hear but can not understand and at his back only a dark and vacant tunnel of time
ii
for year i have intermittently try to reconstruct my grandfather s image from fragment of memory and casual bit of testimony in family lore
only twice do i remember do he ever even notice me i be eight that summer although there must have be other time early that i can not recall
but one day that summer i draw near him as he sit in the glassedin front porch of the little frame house read as he often do from and be proud of my skill but a glance at the page defeat me as have the alien speech that my mother revive in herself each time we visit
look up he grip my shoulder with a sudden hand and draw me to him
i remember the furrowed face dark and suddenly close the faintly leathery smell of him it be probably the great leatherbound bible and the faded blue eye look into mine
then with one hand on the page and the other on my shoulder he begin to read to me a harsh voice roll over the strange syllable as his finger move down the page
uncomfortable i endure a few moment before i pull away
this be in hancock michigan in 
we be there my mother and i for most of that summer
usually we come for summer visit of a week or so my father s vacation from our home in southern michigan near the indiana border to hillside above portage lake and the ship canal face its sister city of houghton across the water
but this summer we stay on while my father go home it be well past the fourth of july i know because i remember hear from my bed the celebratory dynamite blast beyond the edge of town a blasting tradition that remain even though the mine be close
there have be other visit too at least one in the winter my mother and i when i be three and my father be out of work but i have only shard of memory of those time chiefly of a christmas tree with actual candle and of a long swoop nighttime sled ride with my mother down the quincy hill past my grandparent home and around the corner into summit street where my aunt live
my mother be young then not yet thirty and she pull me on the sled up the long quincy hill to the top where the old mine building still intense i can recall it only as a kind of pressure around me and the long glide down the hill toward the streetlight below be a course through cold tangible in the glittering and shadowy air
my mother try to get me to walk the few block back to my grandparent house but i keep sit down in the snow
finally she pull me on the sled
then at last i be undress drowse in front of the warm kitchen range and lay in bed with a hot brick at my foot
perhaps the dream come that night
certainly it come from some time well before my age of continuous memory a vivid and curious dream a dream that return it seem often and that register itself powerfully not so much in my mind as on my body
i be deep in a cave far beneath my grandfather s house and be try to escape through a tiny opening a tight tunnel that i try to wriggle through i i strain to force my way out
year later in college i identify this as a birth dream some urgent reconstruction of primal experience in the only term my imagination could then present to me
by the time i understand it it have be neutralize a academic item only and it do not recur i sometimes cite it for my student as a instance of unconscious memory
but i can remember when it do come wake frightened lie awake and wonder what happen next it seem that i ought somehow to emerge in my grandfather s basement where the family be gather in the summer kitchen and sit down at the table among them
well here i be i would say
iii
my grandfather be a dark finn short and spare and in his later year little more than a scrap of twisted leather top with a shock of irongray hair
his stock be unmixed with the fair and tall scandinavian type of the other northern be scandinavian only by accident of geography migration and recent history their ancestral home be central russia their ancient cousin by another migration become the magyars of modern hungary and dark skin and hair and short stature mark these origin in many finn
within the culture suomi be the traditional name for the language and the nation tacitus the first outsider to record notice of them write of a wild and primitive people call fenni and finland have be a name impose on the map at least since a period of swedish domination
a later emigration bring many finn to this country at the turn of the century many to escape russian domination finland then be a russian province and many to find work in the mine and forest of michigan wisconsin and minnesota
even here they be ethnically distinct and at the bottom of the immigrant hierarchy in some lumber camp the finn be force to eat at their own table the black of scandinavian america how do the finn come to america take a bath and float across on the scum
doubtless the canard originate in their dark coloring and their determination to stay clean that is in their ritual devotion to the sauna which have become their contribution to american yuppie indulgence
no indulgence for the finn rather a sauna be such a necessity that it be often the first building erect on the tiny farm they clear
in the town neighborhood sauna be quickly establish and makeshift home sauna be cobble into many basement and garage
the sauna bath be a family occasion like sunday dinner and often a social occasion among friend
my uncle have a summer home on the ship canal that extension of portage lake that permit great lake ship a shortcut through the keweenaw peninsula
there be a sauna at the water s edge and on weekend visit it be my grandfather s privilege to start the fire early in the afternoon and to tend it in the stove improvise
it be his privilege too to make the bathing switch not of the traditional birch twig but of the fragrant tip of white cedar which grow along that shore
i would see the plume of blue from the chimney smell the wood smoke rich on the air while my grandfather move among the tree cut cedar tip with his pocketknife
and it be his privilege finally to be the first to enter and bathe no one could stand the heat he could endure alone on the high bench near the ceiling
later would come the young man and last the woman and child
the heat entrance me
i suck it deep into my lung where it warm my vital from the inside out and i clamber to the high bench where i sit moist and hot and glassyeyed until my alarmed mother pull me down and scrub me with soap and the fragrant cedar switch
the hardy would end with a plunge in the water of the canal themselves with a sloshing rinse with bucket draw from the end of the dock
at night in bed and in my pajamas i could still catch faintly the cedar smell on my skin
what specifically draw my grandfather from finland to michigan s upper peninsula i never learn
probably the life he leave be so hard that anything would have seem better
he be a farmer but he have serve in the russian army and my mother can remember him demonstrate the manual of arm with a broom
a brother have precede him to the new world and apparently the news be good enough to persuade my grandfather to take the leap probably about 
he leave behind his wife and infant daughter my old aunt who would not be able to join him for several year
his brother go back to finland but my grandfather work for a time in a detroit factory before make his way to the north where many scandinavian have find a climate and a landscape to remind the community of salo for a while where my mother be born and take directly to the sauna for her first bath
i have walk those field near salo in the few place between rock and swamp it be possible to scrape in the earth and raise a little hay feed a cow or two and coax along a few vegetable in the brief summer
but inevitably my grandfather be draw into the copper mine in the year before the first world war
by that time he be already middleaged
great vein of copper run through the rocky ridge of the keweenaw peninsula and over one of them be develop the quincy mine
the operating capital of course come from investor in the east and there have now be write a official history of the mine which be long on the accomplishment of the investor and manager but short on the life of the man who mine the ore
the mine have already a long record of intermittently profitable operation by the time my grandfather the mine and begin the grueling daily underground labor to see what profit he might wring from the rock
it must have be frighteningly unnatural work to begin so late in his life
as a farmer he have rise in dark and work through the brightness of day to the night again but now darkness claim him the day round
the workday be twelve hour
in the winter he would see daylight only on sundays
few of the finn be originally miner only the immigrant from wales and cornwall bring their profession with them along with the cornish pastie the halfmoonshaped meat pie that could be heat in morning and remain warm in the lunch pail until midday
the finn soon adopt these with their new work and for twenty and more year my grandfather leave each morning with his hot lunch pail for the climb up the hill to the quincy mine to the daily descent into the pit
it be brutal work
only as my own body lose its resilience in middle age have be
from time to time the worker strike of course my mother s early memory be of abandoned lunch pail along quincy hill where the violence of the strike intercept those who be try to go to work before they could reach the mine
sometimes a man would come home with his arm hanging limp his shoulder dislocate from swing a pick or sledge a capable wife would put her man on the kitchen floor and with one foot brace each against his neck and armpit pull and ease the shoulder joint back into place
shaft would sometimes collapse and the falling rock would shoot the compressed air out the opening of the mine shaft in a great air blast hear in the home below
and then the family would wait my mother can remember lie with her ear to the basement floor hope to hear the miner hundred of foot below
other danger come more slowly and insidiously
my grandfather wheeze with what be call miner bronchitis probably silicosis year to kill him
iv
how can i reconstruct his later life the quincy mine close in the depression a victim of declining demand and the cheap production from the openpit mine of montana and arizona
social security be legislate in time to give him a small retirement income
in his entire life he never drive a automobile use a telephone send a telegram or own a radio
his bible and the finnishlanguage newspaper be his sole window on the world
most of his family and his wife be have remain in finland and now he be doubly isolate for his child have marry and leave home flow into the mainstream of englishspeaking life
he and my grandmother never learn english the finnishspeaking community be vital enough to hold them enclose all their life
i never understand a word either of them ever say to me except that my grandmother could approximate my name veeli she would call veeli boyga i can still recognize vowel although it be empty of mean for me
the talk during those summer visit surge back and forth between the two language as my mother and my aunt defer in turn to their parent and to the child and husband who speak no finn
mostly we gather for meal in the basement which become a summer kitchen with a door into the backyard
my grandmother be voluble and merry but my grandfather would sit at one end of the table usually silent unless speak to while the conversation flow mainly among the woman in both language
he be not so much sink in the silence of the listener or spectator as he be withdraw elsewhere
there be some claim a distinctive finnish gaze in which some finn simply be not with you for a while their eye focus somewhere beyond you on a inner horizon
my grandfather have it as he drift back perhaps beyond the long curve of the globe and the receding year to some remote gathering of do in mine
return he would drink his coffee from his saucer sometimes suck it through a cube of sugar hold in his tooth
it be the only indulgence i ever see in his life
late in that summer a truckload of slabwood be dump in the backyard and in the afternoon he would split firewood to stovesize piece and carry them into the basement to stack against the wall
my mother tell me that by the time of cold weather he would have the basement fill from floor to ceiling with wood for the kitchen cookstove the only heat the house would have
i sit one afternoon on the back step watch him
he would balance the thin wide piece of slabwood on the splitting block and with precise stroke of his ax reduce it to a few piece of cookstove size toss them into a pile at one side
he give no sign he know i be there
i get out my pocketknife and begin to whittle on one of the odd piece of a few dime extort from my mother and have three blade and a celluloid grip in a swirl of blue brown and red
i think it powerfully beautiful
then i be aware of my grandfather stand over me his dark hand thrust out
in the palm lay his knife large and ancient it seem but with a handle in the same swirl of blue and brown and red
a smile crack across his face and there be a pattern of line etch there i have never see before
for a moment we look at each other i still seat he lean on his ax his other hand extend
then he reach for a bushel basket nearby pick up a few kindling chip from the ground around the splitting block and motion me to take over
after i have fill the kindling box in the basement i help him carry in the split wood for the stove and stack it against the wall
our work finish we step together backyard
i feel a hand on my shoulder his voice crack and rasp
veeli he say
veeli boyga
""
i never see him again
we do not make a visit the next year then world war ii begin travel be restrict and he die in late winter two year after
my grandmother follow him a few winter later
i remember the telegram the vacancy of my mother s absence for a week or so the unintelligibility of a death so remote
memory of my grandfather drift to the margin of my consciousness for many year except for a few provocation
i know that he and i bore the same middle name
a old cousin once happen to remark that of all the cousin i most resemble him
and i remember year early hear her father say that my grandfather be in his way a very learned man a lay scholar of the bible
as the two observation coalesce i feel a line of him not only my name my facial structure my coloring but my love of the book and of the word if not his faith in the book and the word
and i never know until my wife tell me how characteristic be my moment of abstraction when she would pass her hand between my gaze and my own inner horizon
but as the fullness of time bring me my child s child i could feel him stalk near within me and as i look out over my own privileged life i could look in more and more upon the bafflement resignation and consolation that must have be his
now have age bring me full circle to find my grandfather in myself as i seek myself in my grandson
xxv
so fortyodd year after i return this past summer to find that little frame house on the street rise up to the old mine
for more than a decade i have have a summer cabin in the north half a thought prevent my return to my grandparent house
it be i finally understand something i have be put off for a long time
the house itself have be so alter by successive remodelings that at first i do not find it but instead find the one next door which be identical except that the floor plan be reverse in it i meet a man old than myself who remember my uncle
no one be at home at the unrecognizable house next door so i go on up the hill to the site of the quincy mine which now have become a historical exhibit to attract tourist one of which i be
there i confront at a remove of two generation something of the reality of that killing life of the hardrock miner
a pleasant young man guide our tour group from the gift shop into the hoist room still house the great steam hoist the heart of the old quincy operation and the glory of the presentday museum
it be a impressive even now in its repose tower three story above the floor we stand upon
the guide s voice drift away into the silence overhead and i try to imagine the din of this room year ago
clank and hiss as huge pressure of steam feed through its cylinder the hoist turn a great doubleconed drum that reel and unreeled mile of steel cable through a towerandpulley system high overhead to the mine shaft itself a hundred yard away
here it be that my grandfather have go underground with others like himself in small car connect to the great hoist by the long and lengthen umbilical cord on which their life depend
they drop not straight down as on a elevator but down on rail at a steep angle into the hillside cable car under controlled descent
down they would roll in their little car lean back against the slope as the cable lower them a mile or more back down the hill they have just walk up to work but now beneath the very rock face with their drill and hammer and pickaxes fight off the dark with their carbide lamp and heave the ore into car that be haul back up the track they have come down
the deep shaft be bale of seep water by special car that scoop huge drip load from the flooded chamber and discharge them at the mine head
at the end of the shift the man be retrieve a more precious cargo draw back up the dripping shaft and deliver to the day or night to walk back down the hill to their home below
old photograph of the mining crew stare back at me from the museum wall anonymous face sullen and apprehensive of man young and in their middle age
i could not have recognize my grandfather have he be among them
the abandoned shaft be inaccessible now close for safety and much of the network of low tunnel and narrow chamber the miner grope through by their flaring lamp now lie dark and silent under ton of settled retire grateful no doubt not to have to face the daily entombment that the old job entail
the young man drift into different job or left town and the town itself cease to grow decline find a new stability of a low order sustain itself on tourist a little lumbering a growing college across the lake
no one s son and grandson would become miner and no one s daughter would marry into the mine my aunt and uncle and mother all leave in time find their way to college and job in the southern part of the state
the copper ore be still there but too deep to be produce at a profit
thus to the slow fluctuation of economic law do i owe my own good fortune not to have be a miner s son as well as grandson and not to have go into the mine myself
far on up the peninsula be the old delaware mine now open to the public its first level only it
down wooden step at a steep angle we descend a mere sixty foot or so but the chill the damp the dripping rock the smell of enclosed moisture drive into my bone a sudden realization of what the grave must be
a string of dim light let the tourist see more clearly than the miner ever do the sloping cavern and narrow tunnel where they work their day away
from one vantage point we can see the water flood the level below a toss pebble plunk into the dark water ripple spread away into blackness
our guide turn out the light for a moment and jokingly get us to see a ghost some persistence on the retina of the vanished light
other ghost stir in me in the flooded tunnel hundred of foot below here and at quincy and at all the abandoned mine of this ancient and rocky land ghostly miner toil slowly like deepsea diver in depth no one will ever see again at one with rock and water and my neck and shoulder a bursting of my lung as i strain upward and outward through dark waterfilled tunnel toward some light at the back of my mind
our guide turn on the light and in a selfconscious shuffle our group begin the climb back to the surface our claustrophobia palpable among us
we have be underground for twenty minute
the chill be still deep in my body and i think i understand what my grandfather seek to drive out with the fierce heat of the sauna
later my wife and i find our way to the small cemetery on the hillside above the lake where my grandfather lay bury my grandmother beside him
it be a hot day for hancock we sweat in our summer clothes
part of the cemetery the new part be neat and well tend it have be endow for perpetual care the ground keeper explain
the old section be overgrow and unkempt formerly family have tend the plot but two generation have grow one to remember their dead
the ground keeper consult a rusty box of file card and lead us to the plot in his pickup truck from the truck bed he pull out a power mower and cut away the weed and bramble over a small granite marker set flush with the earth
name and year of death only
my old aunt have lay the marker i assume the summer after my grandmother s death
to dig the winter ground be deadly hard work and even today winter dead be store for spring burial and bring to the cemetery tier of coffin on a flatbed truck to be lower into a earth now soft enough to receive them
my mother have never be able to visit the grave so for her sake we take a picture
my wife borrow a yellow rose from a nearby memorial basket and lay it across the stone
stand at his foot feel the tug of mortality at my bone i think of my grandfather lie still and patient in wait in sure and certain hope of the resurrection
the old dream flicker again behind my eye and for a moment he surface in my arm like a drowned man i sink like one into his and i be dream of my grandfather dream my dream
deep beneath the earth in dark waterfilled cave we struggle upward together in tight embrace toward the day
but as quickly as they coalesce the dream diverge and something have be exchange
the dream of birth remain with him and i be leave with another i like less well
i stoop to return the rose to its rightful place
the summer sun be hot on my shoulder but it do not reach deep enough to soothe a shudder at my heart

how those early day have mark me i understand only as i age
after my grandmother s death my mother never return to her childhood home
even now she be reluctant to talk of the old time and i can
in later year i have live in california in the northwest and in the south but in time a inner compass assert itself and i turn my face again and again to the north
a modest affluence and a profession neither of which my grandfather could have imagine permit me to spend my summer read and write in a summer home on a lake where i have a leisure beyond his conception for the book and the word
but i do not spend my winter in this land nor do i want to
my daughter bring my grandson to visit on vacation
on my lap he will sit turn page of book after book with me and i know that as he struggle toward word over bright picture he will grasp a language that we share
the love of the book and of the word be ground here
and i wonder what dream from his childhood will connect him to me
perhaps he will dream of great gray elephant sway through birch grove bathe to time of dark passage but i doubt that this be a dream of birth
the sun have pass from the lake and as we sit in the gathering darkness voice fall silent and the evening chill descend on us
my grandson have clamber back up into my chair and lie sleep against my chest i have wrap my arm about him against the cold and we rest in a bonded warmth in the darkening night air
i be suddenly aware that my wife stand by my chair put her hand on my arm
why do nt you start a fire she say
she take the child from me with practiced grasp he start slightly then sink into deep sleep
i stir myself to lay kindle in the franklin stove and soon the family drift inside as the firelight leap and glint about the room
i go outside for more wood where it be stack in the crawl space beneath the porch the stove be our only source of heat exercise a recreation just so edge with necessity as to flavor the labor with both pleasure and virtue
no one as yet sit on the step whittle with his pocketknife wait to gather chip
i gauge the size of the crawl space in my mind it have never be fill but a small person can stand upright in it and might get back into place too narrow for me to reach
my arm load with wood i pause to look out over the darkening lake
for year we have talk of build a sauna
a friend have give me a makeshift stove weld up from scrap metal and i have plan for the building on paper
perhaps i will stake it out next summer
there be plenty of firewood and birch tree aplenty for the traditional birch switch
but i have my eye on a stand of white cedar just down the road and as i turn back into the glowing cabin i wonder how much of the ancient heat i for those who will follow me

my starting point be a query put to me by a editor

seem from here in america rather small and beside the point
be that how it look from where you be

odd with homosexuality now something like a small political movement one would have think much more would have be make of gide who very early uncloseted himself
gide do seem by now some forty year after his death a relatively forget figure although there be still of course a gidian academic industry
during the second half of his long career he be the best know of all contemporary french writer
as the house genius of la nouvelle revue franaise he be at the center of french literary life and he be also widely know throughout europe as be confirm by his be award the nobel prize for literature in 
although he always claim to be primarily a artist three main subject of general human interest outside sport religion sex and politics
gide have grow up as a fervent protestant and it take him a long time and much heart search to work his way through to agnosticism
he be a married man who eventually feel a obligation to proclaim his homosexuality
after be largely indifferent to politics in his early year he become a prominent anticolonialist as a consequence of a trip to the congo
when the nazi threat loom he throw in his lot with the communist but only to recant almost immediately after a visit to the soviet union enlighten him about the shortcoming of stalinism
gide s very topicality as a writer involved in so many contemporary issue mean that once he be dead and circumstance begin to change his celebrity would inevitably begin to wane at least until the emergence of some consensus about the quality durable or otherwise of his literary works
my feeling be that such a consensus have sexual issue it have to be emphasize that in his day gide be see as a general liberator rather than as a specialist defender of homosexual right
when i be a student in france before the war he be very popular with most young people who read his little book les nourritures terrestres as a sort of pagan new testament call on them to revolt against the religious and moral convention of french bourgeois society and to achieve the full possible expression of their individual temperament
the student i know do nt pay much attention to gide s homosexuality that be just a personal quirk that he be entitle to indulge in if he feel so inclined
what interest them be the slogan familles je vous hais and the general thrill of liberation from the stuffiness of french conformism
gide preach spontaneity nakedness in the sun appreciation of the joy of the moment and exposure to exotic cultural influence beyond the border of france
it seem to me that different way g b shaw h g well and especially d h lawrence have do for the english
if he appear rather more subtle and elegant than the english writer this be because he could nt help be in himself a exquisite product of the high bourgeois culture he be subvert not to mention his quixotic charm as a rentier prepare to saw off the branch he be sit on
i respect his attempt at honesty i think his influence to be all for the good provided some of his suggestion be not take too literally but my northern workingclass cynicism make me doubt whether he could have be so lyrically free and so willing to trust nature rather than culture have he not be permanently cushion by a private income which be a cultural not a natural circumstance
to do gide justice he eventually realize this himself as can be see from some late diary entry but by then his philosophy such as it be have be figure out for themselves how far they could live by it in the workaday world
not only be gide thought of primarily as a general liberator none of his enthusiastic reader so far as i know ever espouse his homosexual cause
in any case he launch it rather late in life he be already fiftythree when he take the bold step of publish corydon his theoretical defense of homosexuality and fiftysix when he admit his own involvement in his autobiography si le grain ne meurt
the opposition understandably be fierce he be at once condemn by orthodox catholic and coldshouldered by other contemporary
there be a famous anecdote about paul claudel who have hope to convert him from protestantism to catholicism point one mealtime to a pan in which something be be flambed and proclaim that be how gide will sizzle in hell gide s homosexual friend show no eagerness to risk public obloquy while the heterosexual one tend to turn a deplore it in private
one friend whom i meet after the war have be careful to keep his son out of reach of gide s attention
another tell me it be rather a strain accompany the great man to the cinema because he would keep change his seat to sidle up to some promising youth glimpse in the shadow
this be say with a rueful smile as if gide s elderly promiscuity be a embarrassing but forgivable weakness
no doubt gide s frankness encourage a later generation of french writer roland barthes michel foucault michel tournier mathieu galley and others to accept their homosexuality more willingly than they might otherwise have do but either through discretion or a lack of conviction none of them have write as explicitly in his own defense as gide do
nor have any of them discuss gide s apologia at any length
all in all gide in spite of his liberating influence have not be the homosexual beacon one might have expect
that what he practice and advocate be pederasty
this be different in kind from the equal partnership between consenting adult which i take to be the dominant militant form of male homosexuality at the present time
there be no suggestion anywhere in gide s writing that he ever have a sexual relationship with a person of his own age apart from some hankypanky under the dining room table with the concierge s son when they be both toddler
his first experience be with arab adolescent or preadolescents in north africa as he explain in his autobiography
he be in his early twenties at the time and in a state of heightened sensibility because of incipient tuberculosis
with his friend paul laurens he be share the favor of a female prostitute when he discover that he derive more sensual and lyrical satisfaction from consort with a arab boy who offer his service
what these service be exactly be not explain
gide mention incidentally that he have a horror of sodomy and he frequently state without define the term
since he also say that he could prolong the ecstasy on his own after his arab partner have leave him one must suppose that his idea of sexual bliss be some form of mutual or simultaneous masturbation
although he have favorite among the arab boy their identity be not important since they be interchangeable this fit in with his repeated assertion that he feel love for his wife but only desire for boy
his diary show that he later go on to find sexual satisfaction in many other place besides africa italy corsica paris marseille and so forth
he admit somewhere that one of the reason why he could never settle for any length of time at cuverville the country house in normandy where his wife live be the difficulty of find opportunity for sex in a area where he be well know
indeed a constant theme in his diary be the need to get away from cuverville he must have be one of the most who live least often in his own home
his comment on his roving sex life vary and be not always as lyrical as the account of his first experience give in the autobiography
sometimes his chief feeling be one of relief at be purge of desire so that he can turn his mind to other thing
occasionally he express revulsion at the indignity of look for satisfaction in the back street of big city and wish that he have not get used to the nomadic life which be difficult to reconcile with steady concentration on literary work
but one important moral point that he never mention anywhere so far as i can discover be that most if not all of these casual encounter must have be base on payment
his sex life presumably depend for a large part on prostitution and on what would legally count at least in europe as corruption of minor even if the minor in question be willing to oblige
perhaps gide just take it for both party or perhaps he be concentrate so singlemindedly on his own pleasure that he remain oblivious of the moral issue as it concern the boy prostitute
apparently his behavior never get him into trouble in france where in any case la police des moeurs be chary of pursue eminent literary figure but the fact remain that the morality of adolescent prostitution be a issue that the advocate of this kind of homosexuality should logically consider
also while gide s pederasty may never have cross the border into pedophilia the dividing line between the two practice be probably uncertain and therefore need to be discuss
whether gide s conscience be absolutely clear on this point remain a open question the diary contain many curious reference to his be egg on by the devil but whether these be genuine twinge of remorse or just ironical aside to himself it be impossible to say they may not even be connect with the sexual issue
when he publish corydon in after year of cogitation friend it find no ardent supporter and it have never be one of his widely discuss text
the explanation may be that it be immediately overshadow by si le grain ne meurt which tell his personal story in the most limpid classical way without any intrusion of theoretical consideration
although he always claim that the value of corydon would eventually be recognize it still strike me today as a muddled unevenly argue little book
since as a homosexual he have not yet come out it be not a direct statement it take the form of a dialogue in which a sniffy carp narrator be ask a selfconfessed pederast corydon to justify his proclivity
from the start corydon be naively present as a distinguished figure greatly superior to his interlocutor in manner intelligence and knowledge
his first response be to describe how he discover his homosexuality
he be engage to be marry to a girl whom he love so deeply that she to gide s own frequently express spiritual attachment to madeleine rondeau the cousin who become his wife
in spite of some disturbing intimation corydon assume that his indifference to other woman be a sign of his chaste devotion to his fiancee
then during his courtship he notice that his betrothed be young brother alexis be become increasingly attach to him
eventually alexis make open advance corydon spurn them indignantly as be effeminate and urge alexis to seek salvation in the love of a good woman
but alexis after give final expression to his feeling in a letter committed suicide thus reveal to corydon both the authenticity of homoerotic emotion and his own latent tendency
corydon break off his engagement and decide to devote himself to prove to other homosexual like alexis have do that what they may feel ashamed of as a anomaly be in fact a innocent natural appetite that have always exist
we be not tell how the lady concerned react to these event still young
""
this little fiction seem to be a romantic transposition of gide s first encounter with the arab boy
it be a fact attest by various source that in all sexual relationship a adult may be entice into involvement by a precocious child or adolescent
but it still remain to be show in what sense homosexuality be natural
""
the simple answer that corydon give in the first place be as might be expect that no human tendency can be outside nature nature take in the wide sense be just that which be
corydon add oddly enough that the only unnatural thing he recognize be the work of art
this seem illogical because if it be in man s nature to produce art then art itself be only a extension of human nature and its supposed artificiality be just nature at one remove
however be that as it may i be not sure that corydon or gide ever see clearly that nature be could equally well invoke it to justify his undoubtedly inherent impulse
in the eighteenth century when the idea of nature be at its most fashionable the marquis de sade do precisely this he stand the rousseauistic concept of good nature on its head and argue with mad conviction that strong individual have a right or even a duty to work out their aggressive nature to the full particularly as regards sex
gide be not one of the hysterical modern admirer of sade but as i shall argue later he have some neosadian or neonietzschean feature that complicate his attempt to extend the range of virtuous nature without go so far as to abolish morality altogether
next corydon proceed to emphasize the complexity of sexuality in the vegetable and animal kingdom
this be a vast and complicated subject that he summarize very rapidly with the obvious intention of destroy the illusion that there be any neat arrangement in nature for the sure conjunction of man and woman
the division into take innumerable form
basically however the female be the essential partner who ensure the continuity of the race the male who evolve to supply genetic variety be a addition a sport even a luxury
one might have think that gidecorydon who be so well verse in the bible would have point out that this be a striking reversal of the adam s rib story which derive the female from the male but he do nt do so
""
secondly corydon say the sexual instinct be not focus primarily on reproduction
the initial prompting be towards pleasure and procreation be a byproduct
because the sexual process be such a hitormiss affair nature overinsures by supply more egg and far more male seed than be technically necessary
the notion that there be any simple balance between male and female either in the animal species or in the human race have according to corydon to be abandon
in addition to the supposedly normal be find
homosexuality be one of them it have always exist not only among human but also among some animal even when the opportunity for heterosexual behavior be present
incidentally if there be no reliable balance in nature this mean that papageno s charming aria in the magic flute ein mann ein weib ein weib ein mann be not express a simple natural truth as one might suppose but a secondary socially conditioned aspiration or idealization
""
this first zoological part of the thesis boil down to say that homosexuality be a recurrent phenomenon in the jumbled wasteful process of nature and just have to be accept in the first place as one of the given mystery
this be no doubt very true but as i have already suggest the same can be say initially about all human tendency of whatever kind including those of invert a term that corydongide always use disparagingly
morality only begin at the of nature favor some and suppress others in the supposed interest of the general good
as it happen gide formulate corydon s naturalistic claim more bluntly in a short diary entry in the name of what god or what ideal do you forbid me to live according to my nature if the marquis de sade have put this question the humanistic answer would have be god do nt come into it
it be antisocial to torture prostitute even if your nature urge you to do so
homosexuality be not so clear a case since it do not necessarily involve physical persecution of the other partner
but if nature be as indefinite as gide say pederasty may be infectious or habitforming with debatable consequence for the good of society or the happiness of the individual
contemporary european society have on the whole move to the position of recognize homosexual relation between consenting adult as a innocent fulfillment of their nature but there be still a question mark against to deal with this
he preface his consideration of the social aspect of the problem by repeat the point about desire not be primarily gear to reproduction
he present sexual arousal in the first place as a sort of extension of universal narcissism i believe excuse my boldness that in both sex homosexuality be more spontaneous more naive than heterosexuality
heterosexual activity he say have almost to be learn witness the legend of daphnis and chloe in which the young man can not perform properly until he have be initiate by a old woman
no wonder then that in certain period of civilization and particularly in ancient greece pederasty be consider at least as normal a outlet for the superfluity of male desire as heterosexuality and be regulate accordingly
also given that the male principle represent sport and luxury in nature it be not surprising that homosexuality should have be especially present in time of great artistic production such as the renaissance in florence or himself whether florentine or shakespearian homosexuality be of the adult kind or not
he just assume that pederasty be the dominant form of the deviance and warm to his theme argue that a bisexual society on the model of ancient greece be preferable to the officially heterosexual society of western europe where young man be expose to the danger of female prostitution of vulgar company and disease
i think that a friend even in the most greek sense of the word be more advisable for a adolescent than a female lover
""
""
""
i maintain that peace in the home family respectability and the health of husband and wife be more securely preserve by greek sexual more than they be by ours
he be write of course at a time when syphilis be still the sexual plague not aids
under the greek system corydon explain young man be subject to the civilizing influence of a old male lover roughly from the age of thirteen to twentythree and explain what happen after that be most grow man permanently convert to heterosexuality or while found a family do they repeat the cycle by take a young lover on the side nor do corydon tell us what the woman thought of this particularly the young girl deprive of their male contemporary between the age of thirteen and twentythree
it make one reflect that socrates xanthippe may have have a good feminist reason for be a shrew
and while corydon accord the female the honor of be the guarantor of the species this do not prevent him from express himself as a unconscious male chauvinist and he make some strange remark about both woman and young man
if the adolescent fall into the hand of a woman this may spell disaster for him alas there be only too many example of this
but since at such a tender age a adolescent can only be a fairly mediocre lover it be fortunately unnatural that a woman should fall in love with him the helpful role play by the mature lady in the daphnis and chloe legend
second it be a odd opinion to have be pen by gide a great admirer of racine whose phdre be all about the fierce naturally unnatural passion of a old woman for a adolescent unless of course racine be a closet queen and phaedra a male lover in disguise but neither gide nor anyone else so far as i know have ever suggest this
third if a adolescent be a mediocre lover with a woman in what sense can he be a satisfactory one with a man unless the young partner be expect to play no more than a totally passive role
this second part of corydon be so open to criticism that one can easily understand why the book have have little influence
there may well be a valid case for pederasty or at least for extend freedom of sexual choice to all individual from puberty onwards s idealized picture of greek sexuality be not altogether bear out by such specialist study as those of xxj k dover and in any case it disregard the historical change in the status of woman
it go far beyond the usual claim of modern homosexual that they be a minority entitle to the same right as the heterosexual majority
and even if we accept that gide may have be react to the defect and hypocrisy of latenineteenthcentury society it seem incredible that he should advocate the segregation of boy and girl at a time when their sexual drive be at its strong and a fair proportion of them mate for life
perhaps he be tempt to be provocative and paradoxical since he be hide behind the persona of corydon
even so the book remain very unsatisfactory surprisingly so give andr gide s general ability
in his direct confessional writing such as si le grain ne meurt and the diary gide be predominantly descriptive not propagandist and the picture he give of his probably numerically limit category of pederast
his main peculiarity be not as it happen his interest in boy but the fact that he combine this interest with the platonic adoration of his cousin madeleine whom he have know since childhood and have always assume he would marry
the chaste semireligious fixation on a idealized female figure it might be call the beatrice complex be a variety of neocourtly love that occur in the makeup of a number of other latenineteenthcentury french author notably paul claudel and alainfournier neither of whom however be homosexual
in gide s case it be particularly strong and coincide with his early religious fervor
one may wonder to what extent if any he see the young madeleine as a real woman of flesh and blood he write about her as if she be part religious icon and part nonsexual mother substitute
after his first homosexual experience he consult a doctor who assure him that marriage would cure him of him why she hesitate be not make clear but she eventually do so shortly after his mother s death
sexually the marriage be a failure from the start
he do nt say whether he actually try to consummate it but in the extraordinary confession he write after madeleine s death et nunc manet in te he reveal that he regularly consort with boy during their mediterranean honeymoon leave her to amuse herself as she think fit
it may be that she be frigid have be affect in adolescence by her mother s infidelity to her father
gide give two brilliantly write account of this family crisis one in his autobiography and the other in the novel la porte troite but he be obviously unable to help madeleine to get over its effect if effect there be
in la porte troite he piously deplore the cruel blow inflict on the heroine by her mother s behavior but he do nt seem to have reflect at that stage pain
late in life gide confide in albert camus that he have be ignorant that woman have sexual urge and need
this be hard to credit since female sexual desire be a common enough theme in french literature and in french schoolboy conversation
perhaps he mean that he have put madeleine on such a pedestal that he could nt imagine her to have ordinary appetite
he certainly keep repeat that his deep love for her be in no way diminish by his pagan lust for boy as if there be no common denominator between the two feeling
however it be not easy to understand what he mean by love since he also say that he and she never once discuss the sexual question
what confidence can there have be between them and in what sense be he a loving husband if he could proclaim his homosexuality and put her into a acutely embarrassing position as his wife without first ask her permission to do so in et nunc manet in te and well he might
whatever his courage in come out he must have know that he be pursue his chosen course with sadian or nietzschean ruthlessness as far as she be concerned indeed he transparently admit as much both by the content and the title of the novel limmoraliste and this can not enhance his acceptability as a model in the cause of homosexuality
there be two far complication in gide s peculiar sexuality
about the time of the war he break his own rule about only desire boy by actually fall in love with one at least for a time
this be marc allgret who figure in the diary and more prominently in les cahier de la petite dame the boswelllike account of gide keep by his lifelong friend mme tho van rysselberghe
the relationship with marc allgret be probably the nearest gide ever come to the greek ideal of mature mentor and loverpupil as describe in corydon which he must have have be the last straw for madeleine and when against her wish gide accompany marc on a visit to england she take her revenge by burn all the letter he have ever write to her
he present this as a terrible tragedy because he claim to have put the best of himself into the correspondence but how could he if he have never be frank with her and add it be as if she have kill our child a strange phrase that imply that he see his writing as the fruit of his womb that she have serve to fertilize through a curious inversion of role
one can not help suspect that consciously or unconsciously he get his own back later in fact soon afterwards by have a real child with mme tho s unmarried daughter elizabeth
this act of procreation by a famous homosexual remain completely mysterious the great confessionalist himself be mute on the subject and those of his friend whom i hear no indication that he be in love with elizabeth and even if he be politely accede to her request to have a child he must have know that madeleine would be bitterly hurt so once again his morality appear very uncertain
it be almost as if at time he be conscientiously try to be wicked in order to prove to himself that he be free beyond good and evil
as mme tho record in her deadpan way even at the height of his involvement with marc and during the fateful stay in grantchester he seduce another boy at the school that marc be attend the boy tell his parent and there be a slight scandal which have to be hush up
when marc reproachfully ask why do you do it uncle gide he receive the significant reply par acquit de conscience to soothe or clear my conscience
in other word gide be so intent on experience life to the full every passing whim without allow moral consideration to intervene
this correspond to a principle enunciate in les nourritures terrestres act before consider whether your action be good or bad
the recommendation be only valid as a reaction against too oppressively moralistic a society it be what the french call a boutade a deliberately paradoxical halftruth but it degenerate into nonsense outside a context of rigid conventionalism
this gidian itch to flout morality irresponsibly be give its strong expression in the comic novel les cave du vatican where the dashing young hero lafcadio a recognizable descendant of stendhal s julien sorel and dostoyevsky s raskolnikov lay a wager with himself that he will have the nerve to throw a unsuspecting elderly stranger out of a train window
he win his bet thus demonstrate the socalled acte gratuit or pure expression of individual freedom
this famous episode anticipate by several year the no less famous sentence in le manifeste surraliste about the essential surrealist act be the philosophical point be the same in both case the arbitrary act be in reality a emotional response to the strain of live in the absurd world where there be no given rule of behavior but only the endless exasperating search for moral compromise
be emotional the act be in fact neither arbitrary nor gratuitous it be a willfully irrational explosive consequence of a passionate egotistical relationship with the self
from the point of view of traditional humanism it could be call sophisticated imaginative hooliganism harmless enough as long as it remain on the fictional level and even useful as mark the absolute zero of morality
gide the celebrated reforming humanist may have be incomprehensibly cruel to his wife but he can not actually have be in favor of throw people out of train window write before in the relative security of la belle poque he no doubt see himself as move back the frontier of complacent humanism by means of a amusing credit for do so
however write some thirty year later during the horror of the second world war simone weil who have no sense of humor be perfectly justify in point out that the acte gratuit be a pseudophilosophical alibi for every kind of viciousness great and small
generally speak then we can say that gide have the courage to raise moral issue rather than the ability to suggest useful answer
certainly in the sexual area neither his theory nor his personal conduct be coherently exemplary and this no doubt help to explain why he have not become a international hero of homosexuality
not that he ever really aspire to this role in spite of his intermittent proselytizing
he could collapse on occasion into complete skepticism about his moral conviction as be show by the disarming diary entry
je ne suis quun petit garcon qui samuse double dun pasteur protestant qui lennuie
i be just a little boy have fun with a final reason for gide s ambiguous position on the homosexual scene be that none of his literary works be openly homosexual apart from the late novel les fauxmonnayeurs and even that be only very discreetly so
les nourritures terrestes his little pagan bible be full of diffuse eroticism which remain unspecific
at the height of his fame in the twenties and thirties his reputation as a serious novelist rest on three rcits or novella limmoraliste la porte troite and la symphonie pastorale which be all write ostensibly from the heterosexual angle
with hindsight all three can now be read as transposition of his personal sexual problem although this could not be know to his reader at the time of publication
in each book the narrator be a version of gide himself and madeleine appear in a different guise in each
all three story end tragically and in the first two the madeleine figure die
i sometimes wonder if he kill off his wife symbolically three if not four time long before she actually die
limmoraliste follow the event of gide s early life quite closely
the narrator michel be a studious young man just begin on a successful career as a scholar and recently marry to a girl he have know since childhood
during their honeymoon in tunisia he discover he have tuberculosis and be immobilize in a village hotel where he nearly die
when he be at a low ebb his wife marceline happen to bring a arab boy into his room to distract his attention from his illness
the sight of the healthy young body inspire him with a desire to recover and there follow a long ecstatic period of convalescence during which michel awaken to the life of the sense so different from his bookish past
marceline look after him tenderly but he derive his main stimulus from affectionate but apparently platonic dalliance with arab complete that upon return to his country estate in france he can not play the part of the respectable landowner but hobnob with the lusty peasant lad who poach his own game
meanwhile he have make marceline pregnant but she lose the child through a miscarriage which undermine her health
michel become impatient with the restraint of french polite society and long again for the desert
this time as they move south it be marceline who become tubercular
he be so obsessed with get away from civilization that he press on regardless and she unable to bear the strain die
michel summons three of his old schoolfriend to the arab village where he have temporarily settle he tell them his story and ask them if he have behave badly they surprisingly leave the question open
it must be obvious to any reader that michel be a monster of selfishness or in the grip of a ungovernable urge
in any case the nietzschean title
nevertheless the conclusion of the book be almost comically sanctimonious in its attempt to halfexonerate the hero
give the dishonesty of the work about the sexual motive it should be a failure but apart from a few overprecious sentence it be so beautifully write and give such a subtle and rounded picture of the spoiled introspective bourgeois discover the natural life and be naively transport by it that it have a kind of classic quality
gide achieve such marvelously precise expression not only of the hero s sensual awakening but also of his selfishness and selfdeception that one can both despise michel and admire him for delineate himself so completely
one may wish that gide have go still far and tell the whole truth but the book as it stand be a compromise that work effectively on a certain level although of course it make no contribution to the homosexual cause
la porte troite form a pair with limmoraliste gide s quest for selffulfillment whatever the consequence the later appear at first sight to be a extreme elaboration on the theme of madeleine s recessiveness
the work be still far remove from overt discussion of the sexual question although the title can be give a freudian interpretation that gide may or may not have intend
he probably know nothing about freud when he write the book but he later remark in his diary that the imbecile of genius have discover the obvious that he himself have always be aware of
in the story the gate be both a garden gate where the hero and heroine have more than one significant meeting and the strait gate of luke lead to the virtuous life
since the theme be the hero s inability to persuade the heroine to renounce her virginity and marry him there be a implied third narrow gate which be particularly difficult of access
the story be another version of the gide madeleine relationship
jrme be childhood whose mother have be unfaithful
this time the heroine be two year old than the hero as be the case in real life
at first they commune in their christian piety and in their shared enthusiasm for literature and music
when stimulate by the example of a more worldly fellow student jrme begin to think of marriage and want to become engaged alissa put him off say at first that she be too old for him and can not be sure that his love will last
she also argue that they be already so intimately bind together by their common love of god that there be no urgency for marriage
from the first it be clear that her attachment to jrme be in conflict with saintly aspiration
her next excuse be that she do nt want to get marry before her young sister juliette
she have in fact discover that juliette be in love with jrme and her motive this time be noble selfsacrifice
when juliette realize this de convenance with another suitor and the marriage turn out to be happy
but still alissa keep put jrme off and with time she gradually turn herself into a sort of lay nun devote to stultify good works
in the end she waste away leave behind a diary that reveal that she have never resolve the tension between human and divine love
the major weakness of the book which gide later recognize in a diary entry but without trace it back to his own sexuality be the passive role play by jrme
if he have any physical passion for alissa he would try to overcome her resistance instead of meekly obey her every whim and allow her to destroy herself
he be not a man but a sexless blank
alissa i take to be a extreme development of the negative element that be probably present in madeleine and at the same time a reflection of gide s own early mystical fervor and its subsequent withering
however the work be still apparently read in some quarter as a genuinely religious book
i find it too selfconsciously sublime as well as distasteful in its bland avoidance of the sexual root of the case but it have a certain interest as a study of generalized anorexia nervosa at the opposite pole from the eager appetite for life in limmoraliste
""
if limmoraliste be the thesis and la porte troite the antithesis la symphonie pastorale can be see as the synthesis
at first it may appear quite unconnected with the gidemadeleine issue but this be only because the symbolism be indirect
the narrator be a swiss pastor in a remote mountain district and he be full of pious expression of goodwill as he cope with his parish his five child and his rather crotchety wife amlie
his parsonical tone be not unlike that of the vicar of wakefield and we know from gide s diary that he have read goldsmith s novel
one day when peasant woman he discover in her cottage a blind apparently imbecilic girl her niece who be left alone in the world
with christian charity he bring the girl home much to the displeasure of amlie who however accept the situation
they call the girl gertrude
when the pastor realize that she be not subnormal but only undeveloped because her deaf old aunt have never be able to communicate with her he embark with enthusiasm on her education
she blossom into a pretty sensitive creature whom he instruct in the beauty of life with a passion he have never lavish on his own child
in particular he be careful to shield her from all intimation of evil hence i suppose the relevance of the beethoven symphony that he take gertrude to hear in neuchtel in this middleperiod beethoven work evil as represent by the thunderstorm be set between movement celebrate the goodness of god and the beneficence of nature
evil break into the story however be in love with gertrude and want to marry her
he be amazed at his own jealousy and equally take aback when gertrude tell him that she have refuse jacques because she be in love with him the pastor and he with her
they seal their love with a kiss and perhaps more
meanwhile a doctorfriend have suggest that gertrude s blindness might be cure by a operation
the restoration of her sight bring disaster
she realize the sorrow she have bring to amlie and that jacques not the pastor be the loveobject she see in her mind s eye
overwhelm by the revelation of evil she throw herself into a river and although rescue die of pneumonia after a last explanation
jacques disgusted with his father s sentimental laxity enter into holy order and become a catholic priest
the pastor and amlie be leave sorrowfully recite the lord s prayer together
this novella which can be read at a sitting be of verbal music compose in the most mellifluous and exquisitely modulate french and ironically contradict the optimism of beethoven s symphony by the placing of evil at the end instead of in the middle of the pastoral structure
the pastor be clearly a parody of gide himself with his semipious semipagan enthusiasm his roving spirit and his didactic urge
amlie be the longsuffering madeleine a almost silent witness to the vagaries of her husband s temperament
gertrude can stand for any of the boy with whom gide become infatuated to his wife s sorrow and whom he help or harm by his attention
if this reading be plausible and i think it be it show that gide can not in the last resort be accuse of insensitivity or of have only the simplistic attitude to pederasty he sometimes express
all the delicate satire of the tale be direct by the gidefigure against himself the selfdeceiving pastor blind than the blind girl and who while constantly quote the new testament in other word the pastor be after michel and jrme a third embodiment of the author s problem and this time he come to realize that he be in a web of human relationship that have be wreck by the unconscious egotism with which he have pursue a natural impulse
in addition to be lyrical and humorous the book be genuinely tragic in a way limmoraliste and la porte troite be not
it be a nonpartisan work of art which hold the moral issue in balance without resolve it and although homosexuality be no doubt the key issue behind its composition it can be appreciate without any reference to that subject
here gide have completely succeed in transpose the particular into the general which as he i think rightly say be the function of art
with the writing of la symphonie pastorale gide appear to have finally exorcize his problem as a married homosexual unable to separate from his wife or to discuss the problem do not go away but he have slough off his worry about it and it cease to be a source of literary inspiration
if at a early stage he have behave like another nineteenthcentury homosexual the english art historian john addington symonds who after father a number of child decide that heterosexuality be not for him and come to a amicable arrangement with his wife french literature would probably have be the poor by at least three book
such be the quirk of creativity
but the slackening of the guilty tension do not lead to gide s emergence as a specifically homosexual novelist
in his last major work of fiction les fauxmonnayeurs sexual deviance be openly present but surprisingly enough in the muted form of a minor tendency halfvirtuous and halfwicked in a predominantly heterosexual society
the book be a summa encompass all of gide s different style the lyrical the absurdisthumorous and the analytical and touch religion as a source of good and as a hypocritical alibi the question of realism in art and above all as the title indicate the problem of authentic living
i be not sure that it be a total success but it be his most ambitious creation and a book with great quality
it consist of a complex interweaving of various different story involve a score or more of character and can not be summarize in a few word
suffice it to say that it again contain a gidefigure the novelist and compulsive diarist edouard
it be never openly state that edouard be a pederast although unmarried he may have have physical relation with woman but as the story begin he be interested in a adolescent olivier whom he have just get to know and who be the son of his halfsister pauline
this may reflect the fact that marc allgret be relate to gide perhaps incest be relatively unimportant within homosexuality since it return be tremulously enthusiastic about edouard but misinterpret the latter s behavior in a fit of pique become involved with comte de passavant a fashionable superficial man of letter with a homosexual reputation and who be present in fact as a bad homosexual
according to gossip the model here be cocteau who have show a interest in marc but the character seem very different from cocteau
passavant want to found a new deliberately scandalous literary paper of which olivier be to be editor although he be just out of school
it be imply that olivier s appointment like the new wardrobe passavant have supply be a reward for service render
in the end nothing come of the project
olivier get drunk at the launching party become involved in a brawl see through passavant s phoniness and appeal for help to edouard who happen to be present
edouard carry him off presumably to bed
during the night unhinge olivier try to gas himself in the bathroom
he be find in time by edouard and nurse back to health
rather reluctantly pauline accept the situation because she think that edouard will have a better influence on her son than passavant
we be not tell about the reaction of olivier s father a prominent magistrate nor do we see any subsequent development of the edouardolivier liaison
although the pederastic idyll be handle with delicate springlike lyricism it be only a very small element in the book and we be even leave in doubt about how far it be physical
besides olivier be a rather dim figure with no particular quality apart from his beauty which be frequently mention and he be outshone by his heterosexual schoolfriend bernard with whom edouard have some interesting intellectual discussion and who be a altogether more rounded personality
there be also a hint that olivier may be only a very temporary sex object soon to be replace by a young boy in whom of the book
if this be so gide be suggest that the pederastic relationship can never be take very far by the adult since it depend less on the personal identity of the loved one than on his attraction as a provisional embodiment of youthful charm in short a pederast be probably more in love with youth and beauty than with any particular individual and this be hardly a attitude that lend itself to a crusading development
at no point indeed do edouard speak out in favor of homosexuality although he argue about many other subject
perhaps gide as he be sometimes inclined to do be deliberately tease the reader who at this point might have expect a triumphant hymn to homosexuality from so scandalous a author
or perhaps he have reach a stage when he accept his deviance with relative serenity as be appropriate for himself but no long have any strong conviction about it be as morally pure or as universally valid as he once think
in either must find les fauxmonnayeurs whatever the book s other virtue of little representational value to the cause

e pluribus plures
question of race ethnicity and religion have be a perennial source of conflict in american education
the school have often attract the zealous attention of those who wish to influence the future as well as those who wish to change the way we view the past
in our history the school have be not only a institution in which to teach young people skill and knowledge but a arena where interest group fight to preserve their value or to revise the judgment of history or to bring about fundamental social change
in the nineteenth century protestant and catholic battle over which version of the bible should be use in school or whether the bible should be use at all
in recent decade bitter racial disputesprovoked by policy of racial segregation and discriminationhave generate turmoil in the street and in the school
the secularization of the school during the past century have prompt attack on the curriculum and textbook and library book by fundamentalist christian who object to whatever science
give the diversity of american society it have be impossible to insulate the school from pressure that result from difference and tension among group
when people differ about basic value soon or later those disagreement turn up in battle about how school be organize or what the school should teach
sometimes these battle remove a terrible injustice like racial segregation
sometimes however interest group politicize the curriculum and attempt to impose their view on teacher school official and textbook publisher
across the country even now interest group be pressure local school board to remove myth and fable and other imaginative literature from child s reader and to inject the teaching of creationism in biology
when group cross the line into extremism advance their own agenda without regard to reason or to others they threaten public education itself make it difficult to teach any issue honestly and make the entire curriculum vulnerable to political campaign
for many year the public school attempt to neutralize controversy over race religion or hope that the school could remain outside politics this be of course a vain hope since the school be pursue policy base on race religion and ethnicity
nonetheless such divisive question be usually exclude from the curriculum
the textbook minimize problem among group and teach a sanitized version of history
race religion and ethnicity be present as minor element in the american saga slavery be treat as a episode immigration as a sidebar and woman be largely absent
the textbook concentrate on president war national politics and issue of state
a occasional great black or great woman receive mention but the main narrative pay little attention to minority group and woman
with the ethnic revival of the os this approach to the teaching of history come under fire because the history of national leadersvirtually all of whom be white anglosaxon and maleignored the place in american history of those who be none of the above
the traditional history american society which presume that everyone in the american melting pot would eventually lose or abandon those ethnic characteristic that distinguish them from mainstream american
the ethnic revival demonstrate that many group do not want to be assimilate or melt
ethnic study program pop up on campus to teach not only that black be beautiful but also that every other variety of ethnicity be beautiful as well everyone who have root begin to look for them so that they too could recover that ancestral part of themselves that have not be homogenize
as ethnicity become a accepted subject for study in the late os textbook be assail for their failure to portray black accurately within a few year the textbook in wide use be carefully screen to eliminate bias against minority group and woman
at the same time new scholarship about the history of woman black and various ethnic minority find its way into the textbook
at first the multicultural content be awkwardly incorporate as little box on the side social historian like stephan thernstrom mary beth norton gary nash winthrop jordan and leon litwack themselves write textbook and the main narrative itself begin to reflect a broadened historical understanding of race ethnicity and class in the american past
consequently today s history textbook routinely incorporate the experience of woman black american indian and various immigrant group
although most high school textbook be deeply unsatisfactory they still largely neglect religion they be too long too encyclopedic too superficial and lack in narrative flow they be far more sensitive to pluralism than their predecessor
for example the late edition of todd and curti s triumph of the american nation the most popular high school history text have significantly increase its coverage of black in america including profile of phillis wheatley the poet james armistead a revolutionary war spy for lafayette benjamin banneker a selftaught scientist and mathematician hiram revel the first black to serve in the congress lynching and racism
even better as a textbook treatment be jordan and litwack s the united state which skillfully synthesize the historical experience of black indian immigrant woman and other group into the mainstream of american social and political history
the late generation of textbook bluntly acknowledge the racism of the past describe the struggle for equality by racial minority while identify individual who achieve success as political leader doctor lawyer scholar entrepreneur teacher and scientist
as a result of the political and social change of recent decade cultural pluralism be now generally recognize as a organizing principle of this society
in contrast to the idea of the melting pot which promise to erase ethnic and group difference child now learn that variety be the spice of life
they learn that america have provide a haven for many different group and have allow them to maintain their cultural heritage or to assimilate oras be often the caseto do both the choice be theirs not the state s norm of a free society that difference among group be a national resource rather than a problem to be solve
indeed the unique feature of the united state be that its common culture have be form by the interaction of its subsidiary culture
it be a culture that have be influence over time by immigrant american indian african slave and free and by their descendant
american music art literature language food clothing sport holiday and custom all show the effect of the commingling of diverse culture in one nation
paradoxical though it may seem the united state have a common culture that be multicultural
our school and our institution of high learning have in recent year begin to embrace what catherine xxr stimpson of rutgers university have call cultural democracy a recognition that we must listen to a diversity of voice in order to understand our culture past and present
this understanding of the pluralistic nature of american culture have take a long and have lead to major revision in what child be teach and what they read in school
the new history isindeed must bea wartsandall history it demand a unflinching examination of racism and discrimination in our history
make these change be difficult raise temper and ignite controversy but give a more interesting and accurate account of american history
accomplish these change be valuable because there be also a useful lesson for the rest of the world in america s relatively successful experience as a pluralistic society
throughout human history the clash of different culture race ethnic group and religion have often be the cause of bitter hatred civil conflict and international war
the ethnic tension that now be tear apart lebanon sri lanka kashmir and various republic of the soviet union remind us of the cost of unfettered group rivalry
thus it be a matter of more than domestic importance that we closely examine and try to understand that part of our national history in which different group compete together in relative peace and even achieve a sense of common nationhood
alas these painstaking effort to expand the understanding of american culture into a rich and more varied tapestry have take a new turn and not for the better
almost any idea carry to its extreme can be make pernicious and this be what be happen now to multiculturalism
today pluralistic multiculturalism must contend with a new particularistic multiculturalism
the pluralist seek a rich common culture the particularist insist that no common culture be possible or desirable
the new particularism be enter the curriculum in a number of school system across the country
advocate of particularism propose a ethnocentric curriculum to raise the selfesteem and academic achievement of child from racial and ethnic minority background
without any evidence they claim that child from minority background will do well in school only if they be immerse in a positive prideful version of their ancestral culture
if child be of for example fredonian ancestry they must hear that fredonians be
if they learn about great fredonians and if their study use fredonian example and fredonian concept they will do well in school
if they do not they will have low selfesteem and will do badly
at first glance this appear akin to the celebratory activity associate with black history month or woman s history month when schoolchild learn about the achievement of black and woman
but the point of those celebration be to demonstrate that neither race nor gender be a obstacle to high achievement
they teach all child that everyone regardless of their race religion gender ethnicity or family origin can achieve selffulfillment honor and dignity in society if they aim high and work hard
by contrast the particularistic version of multiculturalism be unabashedly filiopietistic and deterministic
it teach child that their identity be determine by their cultural gene
that something in their blood or their race memory or their cultural dna define who they be and what they may achieve
that the culture even though they be born here
that american culture be eurocentric and therefore hostile to anyone whose ancestor be not european
perhaps the most invidious implication of particularism be that racial and ethnic minority be not and should not try to be part of american culture it imply that american culture belong only to those who be white and european it imply that those who be neither white nor european be alienate from american culture by virtue of their race or ethnicity it imply that the only culture they do belong to or can ever belong to be the culture of their ancestor even if their family have live in this country for generation
the war on socalled eurocentrism be intend to foster selfesteem among those who be not of european descent
but how in fact be selfesteem develop how be the sense of one s own possibility one s potential choice develop certainly the school curriculum play a relatively small role as compare to the influence of family community that curriculum influence what child think of themselves it should encourage child of all racial and ethnic group to believe that they be part of this society and that they should develop their talent and mind to the full
it be enormously inspiring for example to learn about man and woman from diverse background who overcome poverty discrimination physical handicap and other obstacle to achieve success in a variety of field
behind every such biography of accomplishment be a story of heroism perseverance and selfdiscipline
learn these story will encourage a healthy spirit of pluralism of mutual respect and of selfrespect among child of different background
the child of american society today will live their life in a racially and culturally diverse nation and their education should prepare them to do so
the pluralist approach to multiculturalism promote a broad interpretation of the common american culture and seek due recognition for the way that the nation s many racial ethnic and cultural group have transform the national culture
the pluralist say all of us the us be us and we remake it in every generation
but particularist have no interest in extend or revise american culture indeed they deny that a common culture exist
particularist reject any accommodation among group any interaction that blur the distinct line between them
the brand of history that they espouse be one in which everyone be either a descendant of victim or oppressor
by do so ancient hatred be fan and recreate in each new generation
particularism have its intellectual root in the ideology of ethnic separatism and in the black nationalist movement
in the particularist analysis the nation have five culture african american asian american european american latinohispanic and native american
the huge cultural historical religious and linguistic difference within these category be ignore as be the considerable intermarriage among these group as be the linkage like gender class sexual orientation and religion that cut across these five group
no serious scholar would the same culture or that all asian be part of the same culture or that all people of latinamerican descent be of the same culture or that all people of african descent be of the same culture
any categorization this broad be essentially meaningless and useless
several district including detroit atlanta and washington dc be develop a afrocentric curriculum
afrocentricity have be describe in a book of the same name by molefi kete asante of temple university
the afrocentric curriculum put africa at the center of the student s universe
african american must move away from a sic eurocentric framework because it be difficult to create freely when you use someone else s motif style image and perspective
because they be not african white teacher can not inspire in our child the vision necessary for them to overcome limitation
asante recommend that african american choose a african name as he do reject european dress embrace african religion not islam or he scorn the idea of universality as a form of eurocentric arrogance
the eurocentrist he say think of beethoven or bach as classical but the afrocentrist think of ellington or coltrane as classical the eurocentrist laud shakespeare or twain while the afrocentrist prefer baraka shange or abiola
asante be critical of black artist like arthur mitchell and alvin ailey who ignore afrocentricity
likewise he speak contemptuously of a group of black university student who spurn the afrocentrism of the local black student union and form a organization call interrace such madness be the direct consequence of selfhatred obligatory attitude false assumption about society and stupidity
""
the conflict between pluralism and particularism turn on the issue of universalism
professor asante warn his reader against the lure of universalism do not be capture by a sense of universality give to you by the eurocentric viewpoint such a viewpoint be contradictory to your own ultimate reality
he insist that there be no alternative to eurocentrism afrocentrism and with the roman playwright terence i be a man nothing human be alien to me
a contemporary terence would say i be a person or might be a woman but the point remain the same you do nt have to be black to love zora neale hurston s fiction or langston hughes s poetry or duke ellington s music
in a pluralist curriculum we expect child to learn a broad and humane culture to learn about the idea and art and animate spirit of many culture
we expect that child whatever their color will be inspire by the courage of people like helen keller vaclav havel harriet tubman and feng lizhe
we expect that their response to literature will be determine by the idea and image it evoke not by the skin color of the writer
but particularist insist that child can learn only from the experience of people from the same race
particularism be a bad idea whose time have come
it be also a fashion by organization and individual with a political and professional interest in strengthen ethnic power base in the university in the education profession and in society itself
one can scarcely pick up a educational journal without learn about a school district that be convert to a ethnocentric curriculum in a attempt to give selfesteem to child from racial minority
a statefunded project in a sacramento high school be teach young black male to think like african and to develop the african mind model technique in order to free themselves of the racism of american culture
a popular black rap singer krsone complain in a oped article in the new york time that the school should be teach black about their cultural heritage instead of try to make everyone american
it be like try to teach a dog to be a cat he write
krsone rail about have to learn about thomas jefferson and the civil war which have nothing to do he say with black history
pluralism can easily the potential use in the classroom of the mayan contribution to mathematics
the mayan example be popularize in a movie call stand and deliver about a charismatic bolivianborn mathematics teacher in los angeles who inspire his student who be hispanic to learn calculus
he tell them that their ancestor invent the concept of zero but that be nt all he do
he use imagination to put across mathematical concept
he require them to do homework and to go to school on saturdays and during the christmas holiday so that they might pass the advanced placement mathematics examination for college entry
the teacher s reference to the mayans mathematical genius be a valid instructional device it be a attentiongetter and would have interest even student who be not hispanic
but the mayan example would have have little effect without the teacher s insistence that the class study hard for a difficult examination
ethnic educator have seize upon the mayan contribution to mathematics as the key to simultaneously boost the ethnic pride of hispanic child and attack eurocentrism to science and mathematics if they study mayan mathematics the mayan calendar and mayan astronomy
child in primary grade be to be teach that the mayan be first to discover the zero and that european learn it long afterwards from the arab who have learn it in india
this will help them see that european be latecomer in the discovery of great idea
botany be to be learn by study of the agricultural technique of the aztec a subject of somewhat limited relevance to child in urban area
furthermore ethnobotanical classification of plant be to be substitute for the eurocentric linnaean system
at first glance it may seem curious that hispanic child be deem to have no cultural affinity with spain but to acknowledge the cultural tie would confuse the ideological assault on eurocentrism
this proposal suggest some question be there any evidence that the teaching of culturally relevant science and mathematics will draw mexicanamerican child to the study of these subject will mexicanamerican child lose interest or selfesteem if they than mayans be child who learn in this way prepare to study the science and mathematics that be teach in american college and university and that be need for advanced study in these field be they even prepare to study the science and mathematics teach in mexican university if the class be half mexicanamerican and half something else will only the mexicanamerican child study in a mayan and aztec mode or will all the child but should nt all child study what be culturally relevant for them how will we train teacher who have command of so many different system of mathematics and science
the efficacy of particularist proposal seem to be less important to their sponsor than their value as ideological weapon with which to criticize existing discipline for their alleged eurocentric bias
in a recent article title the ethnocentric basis of social science knowledge production in the review of research in education john stanfield of yale university argue that neither social science nor science be objective study that both instead be euroamerican knowledge system that science and reason be somehow superior to magic and witchcraft he write be the product of euroamerican ethnocentrism
according to stanfield current fear about the misuse of science for instance the nuclear arm race global pollution and the powerplay of third world nation the arab oil boycott and the americaniranian hostage crisis have make western people more aware of nonscientific cognitive style
these last event be begin to demonstrate politically that which have begin to be understand in intellectual circle namely that mode of social knowledge such as theology science and magic be different not inferior or superior
they represent different way of perceive define and organize knowledge of life experience
one wonder if professor stanfield break his leg would he go to a theologian a doctor or a magician
every field of study it seem have be taint by eurocentrism which be define by a professor at manchester university george ghevarughese joseph in race professor joseph argue that the history of science and technology in particular of mathematicsin noneuropean society be distort by racist european who want to establish the dominance of european form of knowledge
the racist he write traditionally trace mathematics to the greek then claim that it reach its full development in europe
these be simply eurocentric myth to sustain a imperialistracist ideology say professor joseph since mathematics be find in egypt babylonia mesopotamia and india long before the greek be supposed to have develop it
professor joseph point out too that arab scientist should be credit with major discovery traditionally attribute to william harvey isaac newton charles darwin and sir francis bacon
but he be not concerned only to argue historical issue his purpose be to bring all of these different mathematical tradition into the school classroom so that child might study for example traditional african design indian rangoli pattern and islamic art and the language and count system find across the world
time when american mathematics educator be try to overhaul present practice because of the poor performance of american child on national and international assessment
mathematics educator be attempt to change the teaching of their subject so that child can see its use in everyday life
there would seem to be a incipient conflict between those who want to introduce reallife application of mathematics and those who want to teach the mathematical system use by ancient culture
i suspect that most mathematics teacher would enjoy do a bit of both if there be time or student interest
but any widespread movement to replace modern mathematics with ancient ethnic mathematics run the risk of disaster in a field that be struggle to update existing curriculum
if as seem likely ancient mathematics be teach mainly to minority child the gap between them and middleclass white child be apt to grow
it be worth note that child in korea who score high in mathematics on international assessment do not study ancient korean mathematics
particularism be akin to cultural lysenkoism cultural trait be inherit
it imply a dubious dangerous form of cultural predestination
child be teach that if their ancestor could do it so could they
but what happen if a child be from a cultural group that make no significant contribution to science or mathematics do this mean that child from that background must find a culturally appropriate field in which to strive how do a teacher find the right cultural button for child of mixed heritage and how in the world will teacher use this technique when the child in their class be draw from many different culture as be usually the case by the time that every culture get its due there may be no time leave to teach the subject itself
this explosion of filiopietism which we should remember come from adult not from student be reminiscent of the period some year ago when the russian claim that they have invent everything first as we now know this nationalistic braggadocio do little for their selfesteem and nothing for on how little social prestige have be accord in this country to immigrant from greece and italy even though the achievement of their ancestor be at the heart of the classical curriculum
filiopietism and ethnic boosterism lead to all sort of odd practice
in new york state for example the curriculum guide for eleventh grade american history list three foundation for the united state constitution as follow preformatted table
those who be unfamiliar with the haudenosaunee political system might wonder what it be particularly since educational authority in new york state rank it as equal in importance to the european enlightenment and suggest that it strongly influence not only colonial leader but the leading intellectual of europe
the haudenosaunee political system be the iroquois confederation of five later six indian tribe in upper new york state which conduct war and civil affair through a council of chief each with one vote
in benjamin franklin propose a colonial union at a conference in albany his plan say to be inspire colony
today indian activist believe that the iroquois confederation be the model for the american constitution and the new york state department of education have decide that they be right
that no other state see fit to give the american indian equal billing with the european enlightenment may be owing to the fact that the indian in new york state number less than forty thousand have be more politically effective than elsewhere or that other state have not yet learn about this method of reduce eurocentrism in their american history class
particularism can easily be carry to extreme
student of fredonian descent must hear that their ancestor be seminal in the development of all human civilization and that without the fredonian contribution we would all be live in cave or tree bereft of art technology and culture
to explain why fredonians today be in modest circumstance give their historic eminence child be teach that somewhere long ago another culture steal the fredonians achievement palm them off as their own encounter this argument almost twenty year ago when i be a graduate student
i share a small office with a young professor and i listen as she patiently explain to a student why she have give him a d on a term paper
in his paper he argue that the arab have steal mathematics from the nubian in the desert long ago i forget in which century this theft allegedly occur
she try to explain to him about the necessity of historical evidence
he be unconvinced since he believe that he have uncover a great truth that be beyond proof
the part i could nt understand be how anyone could lose knowledge by share it
after all culture be constantly influence one another exchange idea and art and technology and the exchange usually be enriching not deplete
today there be a number of book and article advancing controversial theory about the origin of civilization
a important work the african origin of civilization myth or reality by senegalese scholar black civilization that all race be descend from the black race and that the achievement of western civilization originate in egypt
the view of diop and other africanist have be condense into a everyman s paperback title what they never tell you in history class by indus khamit kush
this latter book claim that moses jesus buddha mohammed and vishnu be african that the first indian chinese hebrew greek roman britain and american be african and that the first mathematician scientist astronomer and physician be african
a debate currently rage among some classicist be whether the greek steal the philosophy art and religion of the ancient egyptian and whether the ancient egyptian be black african
george g m james s stolen legacy insist that the greek steal the legacy of the african continent and call it their own
james argue that the civilization of greece the vaunted foundation of european culture owe everything it know and do to its african not in greece and rome but in egypt and ultimately in black africa
similar speculation be fuel by the publication in of martin bernal s black athena the afroasiatic root of classical civilization volume the fabrication of ancient greece although the controversy predate bernal s book
in a fascinating foray into the politics of knowledge bernal attribute the preference of western european scholar for greece over egypt as the fount of knowledge to nearly two century of racism and europocentrism but he be uncertain about the color of the ancient egyptian
however a review of bernal s book last year in the village voice begin what color be the ancient egyptian black than mubarak baby
the same article claim that white racist archeologist chisel the nose off ancient egyptian statue so that future generation would not see the typically african facial characteristic
the debate reach the page of the biblical archeology review last year in a article title be the ancient egyptian black yurco argue that some egyptian ruler be black others be not and that the ancient egyptian do not think in these term
the issue write yurco be a chimera cultural baggage from our own society that can only be impose artificially on ancient egyptian society
""
most educationist be not even aware of the debate about whether the ancient egyptian be black or white but they be very sensitive to charge that the school curriculum be eurocentric and they be eager to rid the school of the taint of eurocentrism
it be hardly surprising that america s school would recognize strong cultural tie with europe since our nation s political religious educational and economic institution be create chiefly by people of european descent our government be shape by european idea and nearly percent of the people who live here be of european descent
the particularist treat all of this history as a racist bias toward europe rather than as the matteroffact consequence of european immigration
even american education if it be center on anything be center on itself
it be americentric
most american student today have never study any world history they know very little about europe and even less about the rest of the world
their mind be root solidly in the here and now
when the berlin wall be open in the fall of journalist discover that most american teenager have no idea what it be nor why its opening be such a big deal
nonetheless eurocentrism provide a better target than americentrism
in school district where most child be black and hispanic there have be a growing tendency to embrace particularism rather than pluralism
many of the child in these district perform poorly in academic class and leave school without graduate
they would fare better in school if they have welleducated and wellpaid teacher small class good material encouragement at home and school summer academic program protection from the drug and crime that ravage their neighborhood and high and timeconsuming remedy that must also engage the large society beyond the school
the lure of particularism be that it offer a less complicated anodyne one in which the child s academic deficiency may be addressedor set asideby inflate their racial pride
the danger of this remedy be that it will detract attention from the real need of school and the real interest of child while simultaneously arouse distorted race pride in child of all race increase racial antagonism and produce fresh recruit for white and black racist group
the particularist critique gain a major forum in new york in with the release of a report call a curriculum of inclusion produce by a task force create by the state commissioner of education thomas sobol
in soon after his appointment sobol appoint a task force on minority to review the state s curriculum for instance of bias
he do this not because there have be complaint about bias in the curriculum but becauseas a newly appoint state commissioner whose previous job have scarsdalehe want to demonstrate his sensitivity to minority concern
the sobol task force be compose of representative of african american hispanic asian american and american indian group
the task force engage four consultant one from each of the aforementioned racial or ethnic minority to review nearly one hundred teacher guide prepare by the state
these guide define the state s curriculum usually as a list of fact and concept to be teach along with model activity
the primary focus of the consultant not surprisingly be the history and social study curriculum
as it happen the history curriculum have be extensively revise in to make it multicultural in both american and world history
in the revision the time give to western europe be reduce to onequarter of one year as part of a twoyear global study sequence in which equal time be allot to seven major world region including africa and latin america
as a result of the revision in american and world history historysocial study curriculum in the country
dozen of social study teacher and consultant have participate and the final draft be review by such historian as eric foner of columbia university the late hazel hertzberg of teacher college columbia university and christopher lasch of the university of rochester
the curriculum be overload with fact almost to the point of numb student with detail and trivia but it be not insensitive to ethnicity in american history or unduly devoted to european history
but the sobol task force decide that this curriculum be biased and eurocentric
the first sentence of the task force report summarize its major thesis african american asian american puerto ricans latino and native american have all be the victim of a intellectual and educational oppression that have characterize the culture and institution of the united state and the european american world for century
the task force report be remarkable in that it vigorously denounce bias without identify a single instance of bias in the curricular guide under review
instead the every difference of opinion or interpretation as a example of racial bias
the africanamerican consultant for example excoriate the curriculum for its white anglosaxon wasp value system and norm its deepseated pathology of racial hatred and its white nationalism he decry as bias the fact that child study egypt as part of the middle east instead of as part of africa
perhaps egypt should be study as part of the african unit geographically it be locate on the african continent but place it in one region rather than the others be not what most people think of as racism or bias
the latino consultant criticize the use of the term spanishamerican war instead of spanishcubanamerican war
the native american consultant complain that tribal language be classify as foreign language
""
the report be consistently europhobic
it repeatedly express negative judgment on european american and on everything western and european
all people with a white skin be refer to say the report be uniquely responsible for produce aggressive individual who be ready to discover invade and conquer foreign land because of greed racism and national egoism
all white people be hold collectively guilty for the historical crime of slavery and racism
there be no mention of the anglosaxon who oppose slavery and racism
nor do the report acknowledge that some white have be victim of discrimination and oppression
the african american consultant write of the constitution there be something vulgar and revolting in glorify a process that heap undeserved reward on a segment of the population while oppress the majority

the new york task force proposal be not merely about the reconstruction of what be teach
it go a step far to suggest that the history curriculum may be use to ensure that child from native american puerto ricanlatino asian american and african american culture will have high selfesteem and selfrespect while child from european culture will have a less arrogant perspective of be part of
in february commissioner sobol ask the new york board of regents to endorse a sweeping revision of the history curriculum to make it more multicultural
his recommendation be couch in measured tone not in the angry rhetoric of his task force
the board support his request unanimously
it remain to be see whether new york pursue the particularist path mark out by the commissioner s advisory group or find its way to the concept of pluralism within a democratic tradition
the rising tide of particularism encourage the politicization of all curriculum in the school
if education bureaucrat bend to the political and ideological wind as be their wont we can anticipate a generation of struggle over the content of the curriculum in mathematics science literature and history
demand for culturally relevant study for ethnostudies of all kind will open the classroom to unending battle over whose version be teach who get credit for what and which ethnointerpretation be appropriate
only recently have district begin to resist the demand and some have not yet begin to do so
the spread of particularism throw into question the very idea of american public education
public school exist to teach child the general skill and knowledge that they need to succeed in american society and the specific skill and knowledge that they need in order to function as american citizen
they receive public support because they have a public function
historically the public school be know as common school because they be school for all even if the child of all the people do not attend them
over the year the court have find that it be unconstitutional to teach religion in the common school or to separate child on the basis of their race in the common school
in their curriculum their hiring practice and their general philosophy the public school must not discriminate against or give preference to any racial or ethnic group
yet they be permit to accommodate cultural diversity by for example serve food that be culturally appropriate or community
however they should not be expect to teach child to view the world through a ethnocentric perspective that reject or ignore the common culture
for generation those group that want to inculcate their religion or their ethnic heritage have institute private schoolsafter school on weekend or on a fulltime basis
there child learn with others of the same groupgreeks pole german japanese chinese jew lutherans catholic and so on be teach by people from the same group
valuable as this exclusive experience have be for those who choose it this have not be the role of public education
one of the primary purpose of public education have be to create a national community a definition of citizenship and culture that be both expansive and inclusive
the curriculum in public school must be base on whatever knowledge and practice have be determine to be best by toolong teacher and scholarswho be competent to make these judgment
professional society must be prepare to defend the integrity of their discipline to examine dispute over curriculum and to render judgment in order to help school official fend off improper political pressure
where genuine controversy exist they should be teach and debate in the classroom
be egypt a black civilization why not raise the question read the argument of the different side in the debate show slide of egyptian pharoah and queen read book about life in ancient egypt invite guest scholar from the local university and visit museum with egyptian collection if scholar disagree student should know it
one great advantage of this approach be that student will see that history be a lively study that textbook be fallible that historian disagree that the writing of history be influence by the historian s politics and ideology that history be write by people who make choice among alternative fact and interpretation and that history change as new fact be uncover and new interpretation win adherent
they will also learn that culture and civilization constantly interact exchange idea and influence one another a myth
another advantage be that student might once again study ancient history which have all but disappear from the curriculum of american school
california recently introduce a required sixth grade course in ancient civilization but ancient history be otherwise terra incognita in american education
""
the multicultural controversy may do wonder for the study of history which have be neglect for year in american school
at this time only half of our high school graduate ever study any world history
any serious attempt to broaden student knowledge of africa europe asia and latin america will require at least two and possibly three year of world history a requirement thus far only in california
american history too will need more time than the oneyear highschool survey course
those of us who have insist for year on the importance of history in the curriculum may not be ready to assent to its redemptive power but hope that our new ally will ultimately join a constructive dialogue that strengthen the controversy arise educator must adhere to the principle of e pluribus unum
that is they must maintain a balance between the demand of the one nation of which we be common citizens the many varied history of the american people
it be not necessary to denigrate either the one or the many
pluralism be a positive value but it be also important that we preserve a sense of a american communitya society and a culture to which we all belong
if there be no overall community with a agreedupon vision of liberty and justice if all we have be a collection of racial and ethnic culture lack any common bond then we have no mean to mobilize public opinion on behalf of people who be not member of our particular group
we have for example no reason to support public education
if there be no large community then each group will want to teach its own child in its own way and public education cease to exist
history should not be pride
no race have a monopoly on virtue
if anything a study of history should inspire humility rather than pride
people of every racial group have commit terrible crime often against others of the same group
whether one look at the history of europe or africa or latin america or asia every continent offer example of inhumanity
slavery have exist in civilization around the world for century
example of genocide can be find around the world throughout history from ancient time right through to our own day
government and culture sometimes by edict sometimes simply follow tradition have practice not only slavery but human sacrifice infanticide cliterodectomy and mass murder
if we teach child this they might recognize how absurd both racial hatred and racial chauvinism be
what must be preserve in the study of history be the spirit of inquiry the readiness to open new question and to pursue new understanding
history at its best be a search for truth
the controversy rather than through imposition of fixed belief and immutable fact
perhaps the most dangerous aspect of school history be its tendency to become official history a sanctified version of the truth teach by the state to captive audience and embed in beautiful massmarket textbook as holy writ
when official history be write by committee respond to political pressure rather than by scholar synthesize the best available research then the error of the past be replace by the politically fashionable error of the present
it may be difficult to teach child that history be both important and uncertain and that even the best historian never have all the piece of the jigsaw puzzle but it be necessary to do so
if state education department permit the revision of their history course and textbook to become a exercise in power politics then the entire process of statelevel curriculummaking become suspect as do public education itself
the question of selfesteem be extraordinarily complex and it go well beyond the content of the curriculum
most of what we variety of life experience not only in school
nonetheless it have be important for blacks for other racial groupsto learn about the history of slavery and of the civil right movement it have be important for black to know that their ancestor actively resist enslavement and actively pursue equality and it have be important for black and others to learn about black man and woman who fight courageously against racism and who provide model of courage persistence and intellect
these be instance where the content of the curriculum reflect sound scholarship and at the same time probably lessen racial prejudice and provide inspiration for those who be descendant of slave
but know about the travail and triumph of one s forebear do not necessarily translate into either selfesteem or personal accomplishment
for most child selfesteem selfconfidence that grow out of have reach a goalcomes not from hear about the monument of their ancestor but as a consequence of what they be able to do and accomplish through their own effort
as i reflect on these issue a talented black runner
she say that her model be mikhail baryshnikov
she admire him because he be a magnificent athlete
he be not black he be not female he be not americanborn he be not even a runner
but he inspire her because of the way he train and use his body
when i read this i think how narrowminded it be to believe that people can be inspire only by those who be exactly like them in race and ethnicity

like many people now in their thirties i grow up in the long shadow cast by the second world war
a green wool uniform hang in our cedar closet and account of the pacific island campaign be part of the casual family conversation during saturday errand or cleaning of the garage
at a early age i know my father have serve with the marine that the fighting have take place on remote pacific island and that the destruction of hiroshima have save american force from a deadly assault on the japanese mainland
legend or so they seem be weave around distant place like the solomon island espiritu santo and new britain
in other family similar story must have be tell about the normandy beach cassino and night flight over ploesti
these war story be vivid scene in the tableau that explain not just something about my father but what it be to fight in a war
in the early s television make it easy to imagine the track small unit on their way to either berlin or tokyo
german and japanese soldier die by the hundred in a manner that portray war as no more difficult than a cattle roundup or in the case of sniper a fox hunt
by that time john wayne be devote less effort to the defeat of the japanese
but other actor such as cliff robertson in pt portray the pacific campaign as updated version of chivalrous guest
army be never depict as faceless industrial machine or as capable of such blunder as tarawa or peleliu
instead they be squad or torpedo boat like that skipper by lt john kennedy which inevitably survive tough scape behind enemy line
no wonder vietnam prove such a disappointment
do nt the north vietnamese realize their role in the epic of american at arm
although i warm to hollywood s romance of the war win with errant knight i notice my father give it a cool reception
as i now recollect he never take me to humor for movielot combat
but he do talk freely about the war
and from our conversation about what it be like to survive a air raid or lead a assault i infer that the best way to fathom war be to read about it
even my father s answer to my boyish question about bomb and bullet contain allusion to literature
before i be able to finish fulllength book i know that the key to understanding jungle warfare lay in the thin red line by james jones or that erich m remarque be all quiet on the western front apply to trench on okinawa as well as to those in france
the memoir of general be write by publicist and be probably unreliable
the only way to understand what have happen be to hear it from someone who be there
truth it seem could be pick up from a radiant that grow weak the far you get from the front line
just as our conversation of war touch on its literature so there on dday and lead a rifle company through four month of the campaign which include a bayonet charge on the bank of the tenaru river
but he refuse either to romanticize the fighting or to wallow in selfpity for have be send there
if anything his narrative be and still be lace with ironic detachment as if survivalthen and nowrequired a separation from the brutality of the warfare or the misery of the condition
because guadalcanal in our family acquire the position of a mythological site it never occur to me that i might go there
not only be it a dark land of giant but it lay in the south pacific among the farflung archipelago that stretch from honolulu to australia
i never include it even in my travel daydream until i be give william manchester be goodbye darkness
the inscription from my father read someday you will travel among these island and form your own memory of the distant battle site
""
i find the manchester in the autobiography of siegfried sassoon and robert grave
but manchester be remember not the trench along the somme but the island warfare that have loom so large in my childhood imagination
he also retrace the step take by the marine on their way from new guinea to okinawa
until manchester prove otherwise i have think gog and magog more accessible than guadalcanal cape gloucester or the palaus
but with relative ease he have fly to honiara the capital of guadalcanal and hike across the battlefield as if he be visit bull run or spotsylvania
his writing mix a travel account with a wartime memoir and a history of the pacific campaign such that it take a careful reader to figure out that manchester be nt the only marine to have see action in all the campaign
but i choose to overlook such narrative liberty
manchester have give me confidence that someday i might travel among these island

my chance to visit guadalcanal come after a business trip to australia that end with port moresby be seven hundred mile east of guadalcanal although the flight between them tend to be on islandhoppers
i finish my work late on a tuesday
the next morning instead of start the slow trip home to new york i put in a am wakeup call in time to catch a am flight to guadalcanal
the only taxi in front of the port moresby travelodge need a rollstart for the engine to engage
in the predawn blackness the driver coax his holden sedan around hairpin coastal turn and through yellow light
port moresby have little to recommend it especially in the middle of the night
downtown be a disjointed mix of highrise apartment suburban office block and openfront store that attract midday idler
like juneau alaska it be a landlocked capital surround by jagged forbidding mountain
the landscape be dry and dusty and the one beach in town be avoid because crime be endemic
the inner harbor with some rusting hulk and a the plot would involve the alcoholism of a diplomat s wife who would be unable to escape the confine of the club let alone the city or the country
i have some doubt about leave myself as the driver nurse the engine at lonely streetlight
but we make the airport with time to spare
air niugini flight number climb to cruise altitude above the owen stanley range where lowlevel cloud whisk among labyrinthine valley
among those ridge at the start of the second world war australian troop have defeat the japanese in bitter jungle fight along the kokoda trail
the day before in moresby i have drive to the bomana war cemetery that lie in the foothill of the owen stanley
the cemetery be the familiar symmetrical pattern of white headstone set against neatly tend grass
all have engrave poetic inscription or simple family farewell suggest a orderly end
but the hill in the distance where most of the man have die in the handtohand fighting have the look of a tropical bougainville down the slot to guadalcanal
on either side of the plane be small cluster of tropical island whose name form a roster of second world war battle vella lavella new georgia the russell savo island and tulagi
at its simple the campaign in the solomons be to control this turquoise corridor that come to represent the left flank of the japanese march to new zealand and australia
nowhere in the world do the us suffer the naval defeat that it sustain off guadalcanal in water that come to be know as iron bottom sound
eventually american firepower exhaust the enemy
but with a few twist of fate the japanese fleet in the slot could easily have cross the t on the idea of the american century
guadalcanal be one of those place at least in literature that rarely make a good impression
jack london who sail there on the ketch snark write if i be a king the bad punishment i could inflict upon my enemy would manchester remember his first emotion as mix i think of baudelaire fleur du mal
it be a vision of beauty but of evil in between be thick steamy matted almost impenetrable screen of cassia liana vine and twisted creeper mask here and there by mangrove swamp and clump of bamboo the forest seem almost faunal arrogant malevolent cruel
my father describe his first impression in a account of the battle that be publish in american heritage at first light we stand along the rail and look out across the calm violet water
there lay the island dark and impassively sinister shroud in a early morning haze pinpricked by bright orange flash of shell fire from our ship
""
for me guadalcanal appear as rocky jungle whose inhospitable mountaintop be encase in cloud
we make landfall over cape esperance the northwestern tip of the island and fly parallel to the coastal road
from a map in a history i be read point and the mouth of the iluplaces of battle that i previously imagine as remote in many way as cold harbor ypres or kasserine pass
i be also strike by the island s color the warmth of a azure sea against a stark green jungle
in my mind guadalcanal be a blackandwhite photograph that show man come ashore or hike jungle trail
the sea and the underbrush be always gray
i clear custom at henderson international airport a name that tickle my father who know it only as henderson field a muddy landing strip that be the prize of battle
in the waiting room be a brass plaque that list the winner at guadalcanal of the congressional medal of honor
name such as archer vandergrift who be the commanding general or merritt edson a battalion commander i know well from my reading but to the other passenger who file out carry scuba gear and tennis racket this might have be a intersection in a new england town and about deed accomplish at the wilderness
on the bus ride into town i be seat next to a american i judge to be in his early seventies
he wear khakis a sun hat and betray none of the hesitance of a firsttime visitor
he have be on guadalcanal during the war although after the fighting and point out such landmark as the original control tower at henderson field kukum airstrip and the lunga river which you cross on the twentyminute ride into honiara
to see the battlefield he say i would need both a car and a driver
to get around he add i should buy some topographical map from the ministry of agriculture and land which be a short walk from the hotel
honiara look like one of those caribbean town that travel guide recommend for a halfday s shopping
it have school a few oil tank government building lots of little boy ride in the back of pickup truck and the mendana hotel
the local businessman with briefcase at their ankle and american veteran on trip of remembrance
many of the american wear hawaiian shirt gim me cap and name tag that bore the insignia of their travel brigade
i find it difficult to recognize these man as the dashing soldier of my childhood imagination as i be sure it be hard for many of them to fit together their life then and now
chat with some of them in the lobby and at the bar make me remember meet a world war i veteran in a yugoslavian village in 
he speak no english but we be try to understand each other when he abruptly leave the conversation only to return moment later carry a large framed picture
it show the same man in his early twenties with dark hair a thin moustache and military trim
you see his melancholic expression convey i have nt always be what you be see today
""
after lunch i buy the map be paul
i wonder why i need a driver at all until we cross the lunga river and plunge into a coconut plantation on small dirt trail
i have always think of guadalcanal as gettysburg in the pacifican improbable place for the collision of two industrial army
at gettysburg today it be hard to see the battlefield for the monument
but guadalcanal as my friend on the bus have point out be unmarked
i have my topographical survey a military history a guide and a rented car and still it be difficult to navigate through the lever brother plantation which be the original perimeter
the island do nt have a visitor center drive tour battlefield sign or gift shop
hence unlike the geometric symmetry of civil war history as present by the department of the interior what remain vivid at guadalcanal even at midday be the fog of war
on one of these cart trail near henderson field we come across another car full of american man about my age say that his father be out in the thicket look for his foxhole
before long the father emerge breathless to declare that he have find the foxhole where he have live for the bad six month of the campaign
i ask a few question about the island then and now but instead of a answer what i get be a monologue
the father recount land on the island his part in the campaign how he survive the importance of air power the sweep of the pacific campaign and on and on
great interest on my part turn to tedium until after twenty minute i walk back to my car
paul the driver be more polite and get another five minute on what general macarthur have be up to in new guinea
i be sure the father have spend a conventional life and function normally
but either the heat or his return to guadalcanal have move the plate along some dormant emotional fault line
i regret my phrase when he would talk of the war s effect and how for some it have scramble their brain
we thread our way through the coconut plantation to henderson field now a long asphalt runway and then drive east to red beach where the marine and among them my father first land
the popular image of amphibious landing in the pacific have marine hit beach edge with thick jungle
fortyeight year ago that might have be red beach but now it be a thin strip of sand that give way to scrubby grass the occasional palm tree and a saw mill
i have expect a marker a few plaque maybe a map with arrow show what have happen which be typical of the american battlefield in europe but instead we park near a rubbish heap and walk to the beach through the yard of a seaside house
to reconstruct event mean spread the topographical map in the sand and dig through the book and article i have jam into a s step because he have write two account of the battle
immediately after the campaign probably in january of he write his company s report
it be forget until the summer of when one of his man send him a copy with a note i be clean out a old foot locker recently and run across the enclosed document thank you for the good example you set for this year old country boy from alabama
before my trip my father hand me a copy but add a critique of his own literary style
this be write he say as if to place the writing along the spectrum of guadalcanal prose in that dry military style
it have all the usual battlefield cliche be about achieve objective and engage the enemy
but i know it please him that the report have resurface
i also have my father s article from american heritage which he write in the summer of at the prompting of who have hear his account of the battle and urge him to set it down on paper
the narrator of the company report be a young first lieutenant who record the action in a style now prefer in corporate memo
for example he describe the landing we penetrate from the beach to a distance of yard inland and cross a tributary of the ilu without opposition darkness find the company deep in the jungle at the headwaters of the at firing break out on the left flank which be answer ineffectively
pfc oscar grover be kill
""
the writer in american heritage by contrast speak in the voice i know to be my father be and the detachment of forty year give the narrative what paul fussell have describe as the irony of war
guadalcanal be not sixty minute of wellplayed football but a unending series of long day journey that be follow by terrifying night
the landing and the move inland be not preview of john wayne at war that be confusing illogical random and fatal
no order come until just before nightfall when we be tell to move on again
we follow the company to our right leave the high grass and push through the jungle single file
darkness come swiftly and i think this be a extraordinary way to be go anywhere toward a possible enemy position in the dead of night
when the command come to halt the man flop down on either side of the trail
shortly thereafter as we lay together in the blackness come our first experience of pure terror
without warning a cacophony of small arm fire envelop us
a japanese ambush but the shot be come at pointblank range
too close we be fire at each other
i do nt know how i make my voice hear above the din but the platoon leader and noncom take up the cry cease fire
shake and exhausted we lay silent until the dawn installment of the price we be to pay
from red beach where i be stand it take my father s company two day to advance through the jungle and seize the airstrip
then the company take a position on the perimeter about a mile inland and prepare for the japanese counterattack
his company report indicate outpost be man on along the east end of the air field
but write forty year later he remember there be gap of hundred of yard between the fortified position of our unit
the only thing that enable us to survive the battle that be to come be the incredible luck that inspire the japanese always to attack at those point where we be dig in instead of the vast empty space where we be not
""
back in the car paul and i wander among some of these empty space look for the site of the battle of tenaru
it actually occur on a spit of the ilu a nearby river but confusion continue fifty year later
paul know red beach and henderson field but not the battle of the tenaru
nor do his knowledge of jungle stream match that of the topographical map
again i be anger that our pentagon dollar have never include sign to remember a pivotal battle in the pacific
belleau wood along the marne be decorate with monument and map of the world war i marine victory but part of red beach be a junkyard and the only way to find the ilu spit be with topographical survey
i be eager to find it because that be where american first defeated japanese infantry and where my father lead a bayonet charge into enemy line
many time i have hear the story of how the japanese have send the ichiki battalion along the beach to attack and they think destroy the us defensive position around the airfield
instead it be unable to ford the socalled tenaru and be envelop by a battalion that include my father s company
of the bayonet charge he later swirling gunsmoke lunging stab and smash with bayonet and rifle butt
in the battle the entire japanese battalion about nine hundred man die
a famous second world war photograph of the tenaru show row of dead japanese soldier press into the sand as if they have wash ashore in a deadly tide
it echo a harvest of death timothy osullivan s photograph of union dead in a misty gettysburg field
after a long walk through dense shoreline bush i finally stand at the mouth of the tenaru and recall the disturbing end to this familiar story
after the fighting have cease a japanese soldier play dead throw a hand grenade at several american soldier including my father who later write miraculously we be unhurt by the blast we rush at him and as derrico cover him with his rifle i place my automatic pistol to his head and pull the trigger
""
although such action be the ingredient of the movie to visit a place where my father have kill a man
casualty in war be easy to fathom when they come in broad engagement and end up in body count
to contribute to my unease whenever my father tell this story he add that he go through the man s wallet and find a snapshot of his wife and two child smile before a lacquered screen
even when i be young such a postscript change the account from a gung ho war story to one that see in every one of the war dead a distant family
for my father the wallet picture may have be the only time on guadalcanal that he see the japanese as something other than a hated foe capable of every treachery
as he later write hack our way through the jungle we tend to think of the enemy as wily orientals at home in this nightmarish terrain
we forget that they be young man from crowded city like tokyo and farmland like kyushu just as we be city boy both my father s company report and the magazine article be remarkable for the way they describe death in individual term
the fighting on guadalcanal last six month
thirty thousand man on both side be kill
under such condition i would expect a battlefield report to describe casualty just as nathaniel hawthorne have describe the death of the stranger in the ambitious guest his name and person utterly unknown his history his way of life his plan a mystery never to be solve
instead each death or wound be treat with a empathy i never imagine to be part of troop movement in the second world war
as a result the report read like a log from a beleaguered clipper ship or daniel defoe s journal from a plague year
at a low level bombing attack be sustain in which private dan xxr hunt be kill and private andrew xxj thomason wound subsequently dysentery heavily affect the health of the company
private thomas xxj knichel die of the disease august shrapnel
in the ensuing fire fight private john c green be kill
the idea of war as the sum of specific death be also a recurring theme among the early war story that i can remember
it form the antidote to my favorable impression of war as a variation on professional football
in particular the death that sear my conscience be that of bob fowler who serve as lieutenant with my father on guadalcanal
million die in the second world war but his death be the only one that seem like the loss of a family member
by the age of seven i know that my father s closest friend bob fowler have die as it be put on the last day of the war
i remember wonder in a childish way why he have not know the war be about to end and lay low
his picture in the family album show a boyish man in his early twenties with sharp exuberant feature and a british documentary on east africa
my father always refer to him by his nickname swifty which add to the legend
in the report bob fowler often get single out for special mention as if he be a favorite son or brother the enemy be compel to retire upon receive fire from the light machine gun in the weapon platoon command by lt fowler
after capture mahile lt fowler be order to move east and investigate a small native mission
lt fowler make a three day combat patrol to wipe out a enemy field piece which have be register in the sector
he personally account for a japanese officer
but the bob fowler describe often to my sister and me be not a ferocious warrior or grizzle marine so much as a cheerful warmhearted friend who somehow have the ability to endure the horror of war and maintain a genial disposition
although i know bob fowler have die mythically on the last day of the war to my knowledge
bob fowler have leave the first marine after the campaign on new britain return to the united state to take command of his own company and die while fight on okinawa
more than once i hear my father say i always feel that if he have stay with me i could have get him through
anyone who come home from any war return with many regret and for my father they focus on the death of bob fowler
it be as if the war have a purpose and meaning until that point after which all the fighting become a variation on the senselessness that destroy the warsaw ghetto
the story end there until i discover in goodbye darkness that the company bob fowler have command be william manchester s
and in manchester s book be a account of how fowler die
manchester include it in a passage that elaborate on james jones s belief of how easy it be in war to slip over the thin red line father have warn me that war be grisly beyond imagine
now i believe him
bob fowler f company s popular towheaded commander have bleed to death after be hit in the spleen
his orderly who adore him snatch up a submachine gun and unforgivably massacre a line of unarmed japanese soldier who have just surrender
i actually read the passage to my father strangely enough at a memorial day family barbecue
he be eager to hear what have happen and i simply start read aloud
when i finish the passage he flush red and swear sharply and uncharacteristically in front of the group god damn it to hell while stinging the seat cushion with his palm
obviously he have never hear the story and it be painful to think of his friend bleed to death helplessly
nor do he want to hear that bob fowler s death have be the cause of a atrocity
the cry be a brief scream of reason that recoil at so many the italian campaign ernie pyle write a celebrated newspaper column about the death of another company commander henry waskow
in wartime paul fussell use that column to deflate pyle as a sentimental propagandist who never let too many fact of war get in the way of his message to the american heartland
but that column describe to me the numbing agony of what it be like to lose a friend in the war
it could just as easily i sense have be write about the death of bob fowler
e b sledge a memoirist fussell much admire write similarly about the death of his marine captain our company commander represent stability and direction in a world of violence death and destruction
now his life have be snuff out
we feel forlorn and lose
it be the bad grief i endure during the entire war
the intervening year have nt lessen it any
or as pyle quote one of the soldier pass the corpse of captain waskow my driver paul and i leave the mouth of the ilu and drive south of henderson field to see edson s bloody ridge and the terrain of the upper lunga river
from this savage noman s land the japanese have launch repeated attack against the airstrip
edson s ridge a whaleshaped hillcrest be another of the fortified position that the japanese be unlucky to strike
even though a few of the enemy break through to the airfield most be kill or turn away in handtohand night combat that my father remember as a distant flarelit rumble in which to his great relief his company be spare any action
edson s ridge overlook the airfield and the expanse of iron bottom sound
if guadalcanal be gettysburg in the pacific this be little round top
it be cap with one of the few historical marker on the island a white obelisk as modest as the rock in the pennsylvania wood that remember the th maine
but the rest of guadalcanal that we see except for the at least historically
the only way to imagine what happen even with a guide be to evoke the book write about the island
it turn a trip to a battlefield into one of those walk tour that visit the house of great writer
guadalcanal have inspire a small library of fiction and nonfiction much of which line the shelf where i grow up
in early almost before the fighting have end guadalcanal diary by richard tregaskis and into the valley by john hersey be publish help to fuel the legend that be grow
samuel eliot morison devote a volume to the importance of its sea battle in his naval history of the war
james jones use guadalcanal as the setting for the thin red line although he create a fictional landscape
as he write in the foreword to have use a completely make up island would have be to lose all of these special quality which the name guadalcanal evoke for my generation
""
i
he write about a rifle companyeven a c companyduring the early month of the campaign
he get it right be the phrase that convey the adulation
he describe the company with the clinical pinpoint accuracy that herman melville use to convey life aboard a whaler
man foul themselves in fear laugh at ghastly wound inflict on the enemy learn to fight as if this be one of the indian war and when they least expect to show courage or cowardice
and jones write in the crisp purposeful language that be the best expression of the clarity of american thought at midcentury
the prose be brutal sardonic pessimistic witty and always to the point
the intervening year may have soften the tone but the voice i hear in jones be one that at time i can recognize in my father s account of the war
unfortunately i come to jones after read a number of vietnam novel that he inspire
as a result the familiar
incompetent command be a given in vietnam novel hardly the revelation that it must have be in jones
i have expect the thin red line to be the definitive book on guadalcanal
instead i find it date
i could appreciate jones as one of the master of war fiction and that this be a novel about more than a south pacific battle
but it belong to a generation that be not mine
mostly i be draw to the book that in some way tell me literally what it be like for my father on the island
often these be memoir like that by manchester or another by herbert merillat whose diary of the fighting publish in gaudalcanal remember flesh out incident of the battle that i only know in fragment
of the henderson field shelling on the night of october merillat write the shelter shake as if set in jelly
although with the old breed be not about guadalcanal e b sledge s on peleliu and okinawa be so vivid that they encompass the early battle as siegfried sassoon s remembrance of the somme stand also for passchendaele and verdun
but it be not only memoir and novel that can explain to a son his father s war
act of war by the sandhurst historian richard holmes describe the sociology of battle with each chapter cover a subject such as what it be like to endure artillery fire alcohol and combat why man desert or what it be to be wound
the writing be a lively juxtaposition of literary allusion and eyewitness account
in explain that man fight not out of hatred of the enemy but to maintain the respect of their peer holmes marshal evidence from vietnam the falklands the civil war and even the holy war
he write that the death of a friend be often what ignite a atrocity and quote among his example the passage from manchester on the death of bob fowler
that there be bad book mention be guadalcanal diary write by richard tregaskis a newspaperman
he land with the marine in the early wave spend almost two month on the island and then return home to write what become a bestseller and a popular movie
tregaskis s shortcoming be that as a reporter he be free to leave the island at any time
everyone else have to stick around until they be kill wound take prisoner or relieve
in a stock story about tregaskis my father recall see him once from a distance ride in a general s jeep
that be strike two how could a general understand anything about the front line after a while tregaskis evolve into a cautionary tale
he inhabit one world interview general and ride around in jeep in the other be the man of my father s company some be shoot and others die of dysentery
the fable divide the world between observer and participant
we have no choice we world
it also lay bare one of the great paradox of the war
i be sure my father hate the misery of guadalcanal and long to leave the place
but if leave mean let down his man or depart the arena for the box seat then he be happy to stay
ironically another correspondent john hersey write a book that my father praise as the fine on the fighting along the matanikau river where paul and i end our drive
the subtitle of into the valley be a skirmish of the marine and it be to war what the element of style be to writinga concise primer
the matanikau flow into the sealark channel through what be now honiara
but during the war it mark the western edge of the wild frontier between the american and the japanese
my father still shudder ever so slightly when discuss it
he like to quote daniel boone s phrase about kentucky a dark and bloody land
merillat be like dive into a dark stagnant pool and that it be a maze of ridge fringe with scallop ofjungle
""
the matanikau do not have the jungle look of a rain forest but it do look like a angry sea where the wave have petrified into sharp hill
such a landscape offer each side wonderful opportunity for ambush and into the valley describe one that engulf a company of marine
pin down and bloodied the man retreat perhaps not with the haste of those in the red badge of courage but in the same direction
during a lull hersey ask a group of soldier what they be fight for
no one really want to answer the question
nor do anyone advance any theory on the geopolitical balance in asia
finally one whisper jesus what i have give for a piece of blueberry pie
hersey do his best to extrapolate that what the man be really fight for be to get the into the valley be reissue in hersey return to this passage if you ask how a nation could win a war whose soldier would opt for apple pie rather than a chance for heroic death i would be inclined to answer that this be one of the main reason why our side win
there be a lifesaving skepticism and irony embed in the confused courage of man breed to free choice
""
in his own writing my father never say why he be fight
like many he be draft and decide to enlist in the marine as a officer before be sweep into the asmy as a private
he talk about get it over about get home as if he be on a extended business trip
but he also often draw a connection between his enlistment and two childhood summer spend on a bicycle in germany
by chance he see hitler beside the illuminated column at nuremburg and jesse owens win at the olympics
he also see from one year to the be ride and he would speak about how he believe war be inevitable give what he be see probably necessary
almost strong than my father s reason for join be his impulse to speak about what happen during the fighting
over the year we have have numerous conversation about the war
they come up at odd time and go into great detail about this action or that officer
part of his eagerness to talk must be to keep alive memory of those like bob fowler or to make sense of eventslike the fighting along the matanikauthat at the time must have seem senseless
but it also seem akin to the need among holocaust survivor to bear witness to make it clear what all war be about
hersey who see not only guadalcanal but the ruin of hiroshima and warsaw reflect in the foreword of into the valley one of the thing i learn be that war make no national or racial or ideological distinction as it degrade human being
""
i have about his war experience
paul fussell write that many veteran be numb after the war and reluctant to tell the truth about what happen to them
fussell believe that a consequence of such silence be a national illusion about the reality of combat
now fifty year later he write in wartime there have be so much talk about the good war the justified war the necessary war and the like that the young and the innocent could get the impression that it be really not such a bad thing after all
it be thus necessary to observe that it be a war and nothing else and thus stupid and sadistic
ironically it be my father s war story that first create and later take away a most cherished childhood illusion that of the good war
that evening at the mendana hotel i be conscious of how my time on guadalcanal have differ from that of my father
tired from the long hot day i and sleep in a airconditioned room
i do not have to flop alongside a trail or wonder if a artillery shell would find me in a inadequate foxhole
i have even great admiration for anyone who spend time on the island even the maligned tregaskis
darkness spread quickly after sunset as do the mosquito that follow me on a afterdinner walk i take to a bridge over the matanikau
look along the cavernous riverbank i be remind of the last sentence in wuthering height when the narrator stand over a grave site in the moor wonder how anyone could ever imagine unquiet slumber for the sleeper in that quiet earth
on the way back i pass a few piece of rust artillery in front of municipal building
otherwise nothing be a reminder of the battle or make the connection between this stream and a similar one at antietam
in the semiofficial history of monument and driving tour it appear a blank slate
only book such as manchester s and hersey serve here keep it alive
by matthew stevenson
matthew stevenson formerly a editor of harper s work for a bank in new york for which he travel frequently to australia and other pacific country
the case of toynbee hall
jane addams visit london for the first time in november 
she be escort through the slum of the east end by a city missionary as she refer to himperhaps a member of the london city mission which have be preach and practice the social gospel in the east end for halfacentury or perhaps of the more recent salvation army a offshoot of the christian mission
in any case this be jane addams s first encounter with what her guide call the submerged tenth
""
writing of this incident in her memoir twenty year at hullhouse miss addams recall the satisfaction of the guide in utter the then new phrase as she put it the submerged tenth
in fact the phrase do not become current until seven year later with the publication of general booth be in dark england
miss addams do not then meet general booth the founder do she then meet other prominent member of the london philanthropic community who could have enlighten her about the submerged tenth the reverend barnett vicar of st jude s in whitechapel who be at that very time plan the establishment of toynbee hall which be to be the model for her own hull house or octavia hill whose housing project be in effect a social work program or charles loch and helen bosanquet who practice the new science of charity develop by the charity organisation society or charles booth no relation to general booth who have not yet begin his monumental life and labour of the people in london but who have just write a private testament affirm his faith in the comtian religion of humanity or beatrice webb who be also smite by that comtian ideal and be about to embark on her apprenticeship first in social work and then in social research or any of the other man of intellect and property of course in the familiar generic sense whose social consciousness have be arouse and who be devote their livesliterally their life not merely their moneyto the service of humanity
on subsequent visit to england miss addams be to meet many of these people but never the one person whom she might have find especially congenial arnold toynbee
this be most regrettableregrettable not only that she never meet the man who inspire toynbee hall and thus hull house but that she could not meet him because he have die early that year at the tragically young age of thirty
shortly before his death toynbee have deliver a lecture criticize henry george s progress and poverty
the lecture conclude with a passionate mea culpa
we middle class i mean not merely the very richwe have neglect you instead of justice we have offer you charity and instead of sympathy we have offer you hard and unreal advice but i think we be change
i think that many of us would spend our life in your service
you havei say it clearly and advisedlyyou have to forgive us for we have wrong you we have sin against you grievouslynot know always but still we have sin and let us confess it but if you will forgive usnay whether you will forgive us or notwe will serve you we will devote our life to your service and we can not do more
these word be often quote as if they come at the very end of the lecture
in fact they be follow by a few sentence in which toynbee ask for a quid pro quo from the working class
we will ask you to remember this we work for you in the hope and trust that if you get material civilization if you get a better life you will really lead a better life
if that is you get material civilization remember that it be not a end in itself
remember that man like but like the tree and plant he must grow upwards towards the heaven
if you will only keep to the love of your fellow man and to great ideal then we shall find our happiness in help you but if you do not then our reparation will be in vain
today these passage be likely to offend or embarrass us
we may find them mawkish hypocritical condescending at the very least unpersuasive and unrealistic
to try to understand them as contemporary do be to come to term with a culture and society very different from ours to come to term also with attitude and assumption on our own part which may inhibit such a understanding
there be two criticism commonly make of victorian philanthropy
the old more familiar criticism be that such philanthropy be obsolete and irrelevant that social problem can not be solve or even remedy by small private voluntary effort but require either substantial legislative and administrative action by the state or radical institutional this view be not only irrelevant but counterproductive since it distract attention from any real solution or remedy
moreover the argument continue it be as obsolete in victorian time as it be today for industrialism from the beginning and certainly by the end of the nineteenth century create problem that be beyond the scope of individual
unemployment for example be not the result of a failure of character on the part of worker or a failure of compassion on the part of employer
and it could not be solve or even alleviate by welldisciplined worker or wellintentioned employer or wellwishing philanthropist
more recently criticism have take a different turn
the gravad of the charge now be that philanthropy by its very nature be a selfserving exercise on the part of philanthropist at the expense of those whom they be ostensibly serve
philanthropy now stand condemned not only as ineffectual be the least of its offenses as hypocritical even immoral
in place of the original etymological meaning of word be now identify with the love of self
thus philanthropy be see as a mean of promote the social status of the philanthropist who be pleased to serve on board and attend charity ball in the company of titled or royal personage and to receive token of gratitude and recognition preferably in the form of a knighthood or peerage
or it be see as the occasion for cultivate social connection that result in tangible economic reward
or as a way of enhance the philanthropist s selfesteem and selfapprobation as others respect him more so he respect himself more
or as a mean a relatively painless mean of aton for his sense of guilt possibly for riches unethically acquire
or as a passport to heaven a record of good works and virtue perhaps to offset some palpably bad works and vice
or as a opportunity to flaunt one s power and person even to flaunt one s goodness and selflessness
or as a combination of these motive and many others one can have the effect of impugn the character of philanthropist but not necessarily discredit their work they may have do good in spite of themselves
but there be another dimension to this argument which do reflect upon the work itself
if philanthropy be see as serve the interest of individual philanthropist so it may be see as serve the interest of their class the middle class or bourgeoisie as a marxist would say
among historian this thesis go under the name of social control
in profess to help the poorin encouraging the virtue and habit of sobriety thrift prudence diligence cleanliness orderliness selfdiscipline selfreliance philanthropist it be say be impose upon the poor value that be alien to them and inimical to them
since they be not workingclass but middleclass value the value of the hegemonic culture as it be say they violate the indigenous workingclass culture
and in violate that culture they undermine the class consciousness and class identity require struggle
moreover these bourgeois value not only deprive the poor of the mean of liberation and emancipation they make them conspire in their own enslavement and exploitation by instil in them a work ethic design to make them more productive member of the labor force and more docile member of society
philanthropy in short be a insidious exercise in social control mean of control the low class and ensure the hegemony of the upper class
it be almost impossible to refute this social control thesis empirically
there be no evidence one can adduce that can not be interpret in these invidious term
if one philanthropist promote a educational reform it be because educated worker be more efficient and profitable than uneducated one and if another oppose that reform it be to keep the poor in a state of ignorance and submission
it be a nowin situation
the only rebuttal be the formal logical one that a theory which can explain anything and everything and which
there be another more fruitful way of address this issue by example rather than argument
for instance it have be say be no proof
yet it be in a wayor as close to proof as history often provide
such a example be toynbee hall one of the philanthropic monument of latevictorian england
the first thing to be say about toynbee hall be that toynbee have no part in its founding
toynbee hall be establish the year after toynbee s death as a memorial to him
at the time his wife and some of his friend demur point out that toynbee himself have not be involved in the planning or even conception of the hall and that his own acquaintance with the east end be limit
although he have often visit the barnett in whitechapel the only time he actually live in the east end be as a student at oxford when he spend a fortnight s vacation do volunteer work for the charity organisation society
the actual founder of st jude s who have long be encouraging young man from the university to visit and work in his parish and decide to formalize this arrangement by establish a house where they could actually reside
yet if toynbee hall be not the creation of toynbee it waspace his wifea fitting memorial to him for it be inspire by the idea of citizenship that be at the heart of his philosophy
there be a nice coincidence in the founding of toynbee hall in and the passage that year of the reform act that give the suffrage to most of the working class
in a sense the suffrage be the formal manifestation of citizenship and toynbee hall its existential realization
for toynbee as for his mentor the philosopher t h green citizenship be not only the right to vote although they do not disparage that right it be also the right and the obligation of each citizen to cultivate his best self and to pursue the common good
this positive freedom
in contrast to john stuart mill green insist that freedom be not the will to do anything and everything the right of every individual to do as he like so long as he do not prevent another from do so
the individualor citizen as green preferredwas a grow man in civil society who want more from freedom than the right to do as he likedto get drunk for example
he want and deserve the freedom to realize his best self
this be the truly democratic idea of freedom
when we speak of freedom as something to be so highly prize we mean a positive power or capacity of do or enjoy something worth do or enjoy and that too something that we do or enjoy in common with others
every person not just the superior person have the capacity to realize his best self and in community with everyone else to realize the common good citizenship have two essential aspect the pursuit of the best self and the pursuit of the common good
it be this philosophyphilosophical idealism as it be called toynbee adopt from green and that barnett want to realize in toynbee hall
toynbee hall be to be civil society writ small a microcosm of the large community a social laboratory which might achieve on a small scale what could not yet be realize on a large scale
on this model of civil society barnett himself a minister of the church of england insist that toynbee hall be nonsectarian which make it especially attractive to the jew of whitechapel by the turn of the century onequarter of the student in the university extension course be jewish
he also insist that it be not a mission in any sense
the resident be not missionary bring the faith to the heathen nor be they almoner bring them money food or clothes
they be settler who come to live among as much as to teach to receive as much as to give
""
the idea of community or fellowship be the inspiring principle of toynbee hall
but it be a community and fellowship for a purpose to elicit the best in each individual and the best in the community
the young man who be resident in toynbee hall be expect to give the best of themselves so as to cultivate the best in others
they be to be citizen in the high sense of the word fulfil their own civic obligation by help those less privileged than themselves to fulfill their better self
this explain much about toynbee hall that might otherwise be think inappropriate and peculiar
it explain for example why toynbee hall resemble a civic and educational institution more than a charitable institution
it do not dispense relief or charity it dispense education culture and civic amenities
the calendar of educational activity in a typical month include evening class on arithmetic write draw citizenship for example be on th century musicworks by handel bach scarlatti etc afternoon class for girl on dressmaking write and composition geography bookkeeping needlework hygiene read and recitation french sing cook and swimming and evening session devoted to the discussion of legal principle and current social issue
in addition there be a roster of university extension course that many a modern college might well envy
there be course on geology physiology botany and chemistry on hebrew greek and latin on european and english history and on a wide range of literary subjects the pilgrim s progress walter scott and browning on the elizabethan dramatist dekker lyly and of course shakespeare this particular month they be read hamlet and the taming of the shrew on dante goethe and french literature diderot moliere and hamlet in french translation
all the heart of the east end the poor section of london
one be not surprised to find that most of the student attend the university extension course be as the economics teacher report the best sort of worker steady thrifty interested in the improvement of their order or that the latin and greek student be mainly clerk or small tradesman although one be a foreman at the dock
the popular lecture on saturday night attract a wide range of worker who come to hear such lecturer as charles booth who use toynbee hall as a source of information for his life and labour of the people in london leslie stephen the writer and editor of the dictionary of national biography now more famous as the father of virginia woolf arthur sidgwick the greek scholar and his brother henry sidgwick the philosopher mrs humphry ward the novelist a xxv dicey the jurist the liberal party leader asquith before notoriety overcome him oscar wilde
and then there be all the other activity sponsor by toynbee hall a shakespeare society a elizabethan society a smoker s club where political passion be supposed to be temper by tobacco a traveller club that arrange trip abroad this mainly for local schoolteacher flower show concert art exhibit when the painting and photograph outgrew toynbee hall a special building be erect call the whitechapel art palace a library open to the public and utilize by more than people each year andbarnett s personal favorite the child s country holiday fund in the fund manage to send more than child from the east end to the country for a holiday
the hall also serve as a civic center a meeting place for trade union and strike committee county council and school board official social worker and investigator tenant representative and other local group
in addition and not least be toynbee fifteen or so young man who live in it for period range from three month to several year
the hall have be criticize for serve the interest of the resident better than those of the community
but this be to misunderstand its essential purpose
from the beginning the residential function be give at least as much weight as the communal function indeed the two be see as integrally relate because they both derive from the idea of citizenship
the young man be to live among the poor so that they would become better acquaint with them move more easily among them understand and sympathize with them and assist them in whatever way they could but they be not to live the life of the poor or lose themselves in the service of the poor
they be not to be latterday saint francises
on the contrary they be to show the poor the possibility of a more elevated more gracious more fulfilling life a life that the poor would not be able to emulate but that could
toynbee hall be not simply a settlement house it be a university settlement not only because its resident be university man and because it offer university extension course but also because it be deliberately construct except for its redbrick facade to resemble a college hall
it contain suite and bedsitter for the resident much like those in a oxford college a classroom that could accommodate three hundred a conversation room a drawing room and a large dining room cum library decorate with the crest of oxford and cambridge college
in this collegial setting civilised but without undue luxury or display the architect describe it resident live
and here the worker in the neighborhood come to attend class and meeting mingle with university man and community leader and living at least briefly a mode of life very different from their own
other settlement found soon afterwards be name oxford house balliol house and wadham house
""
the resident pay it be regard as a privilege not everyone could purchase a residency there
applicant have to be approve by a committee of resident be admit on probation and have to be confirm after three month
and the resident be bind by strict house rule that be more reminiscent of boarding school than of college
they dine at specified hour have a fixed bedtime and be assign particular duty
whether they work in the east end or pursue career as teacher civil servant or lawyer elsewhere in the city they be all expect to devote their spare time to communal affair
barnett describe them not ironically as clubmen but their club resemble a religious order more than the familiar west end variety
toynbee hall he write seem to its visitor to be a center of education a mission a center of social effort
it may be so but the visitor miss the truth that the place be a clubhouse in whitechapel the neighborhood
when william beveridge author of the beveridge report the founding document as it were of the welfare state be subwarden of toynbee hall in he deliver a paper entitle the influence of university settlement which be devoted entirely to their influence upon the resident
the paper he confess be a foolish legpull but it have a serious point which be that the essence of the settlement lay in the individual life of the resident as they be affect by the special experience of live in that particular place
jane addams say of hull house that it be more for the people who do it than for the other class
she also explain that her first reason for found hull house be to give purpose and mean to her own life her second be the desire to help the poor
""
today these statement would be regard as evidence of the elitist authoritarian selfserving nature of purpose of the social worker rather than of their client and design to imbue the working class with a middleclass culture as well as a middleclass ethic
to barnett as to jane addams these statement testify to the democratic nature of the institution
the rich and the poor they believe have a common commitment to citizenship and require a common education for that civic vocation
they also assume that the poor as much as the rich be able and willing to receive such a education because they share a common human nature
this be what jane addams mean when she say that it be important to hold all man to one democratic standard
and it be what green mean when he insist that man by naturenot by class breeding wealth or some special grace but by simple human naturewas a rational moral be capable of realize his best self and pursue the common good
this be also what contemporary mean when they speak of the settlement house as a bridge between the metaphor
that bridge be not mean to abolish either class or individual toolong of wealth occupation status or talent
it be mean rather to bridge them to establish the common denominator of citizenship that make tolerable those other distinction which be natural and inevitable but which should not be exacerbate and should not be allow to obscure the common claim to citizenship
the settlement house be not a experiment in socialism it be a experiment in democracywhich be no mean feat at that time and place
it be often say that the great achievement of toynbee hall like that of hull house be the training of a professional corps of social administrator who later assume important position in the department and agency of the state social service state as the forerunner of the welfare state have be call and then the welfare state itself
one can produce a roster of such namesbeveridge sometimes know as the father of the welfare state clement attlee the prime minister who actually inaugurate host of others less familiar today but well know at the time
no doubt in the early twentieth century toynbee hall do serve in a sense as a training and recruitment center for the expanding state
but if this be its main achievement one would have to say that it be a failure at least from the point of view of its founder
for this be not what they intend and it be not the spirit that inform it in the first decade of its history
the founder and early resident have no objection to social legislation indeed they publicly advocate it
in a lecture deliver the year before he die be radical socialist toynbee explain that the radical that is the radical faction of the liberal party have already commit themselves to so much of the socialist program in the form of factory act sanitation and health act land acts the continental form of socialism which seek to abolish private property be totally in a article the following year on practicable socialism which he identify with the poor law the education act the irish land act the artisan dwelling act the library act and the like
but these socialist measure he insist be no substitute for the kind of institution represent by toynbee hall
in argue for the irrelevancy or inadequacy of the settlement house or the housing project or the salvation army or barnardo s home for child or any other victorian philanthropy or for that matter any modern philanthropy critic make it sound as if this particular institution alone be mean to solve the social problem or even any one aspect of that problempoverty or housing or neglected child or what have you
in fact the victorian no less than modern philanthropist be acutely aware of the multiplicity of agency private and public which complement and supplement one another as often as not duplicate one personally associate with not one but several cause and institution the result be something like a network of interlocking directorate
this be what sidney webb mean when he say nothing in england be do without the consent of a small intellectual yet practical class in london not in number
even the most laissezfairist representative of this philanthropic class the leader of the charity organisation society be engage in organize and coordinate not only private charity but public relief as well
other take the initiative in urge various form of state intervention barnett and charles booth be among the early and most vigorous proponent of a statefinanced and administer oldage pension system
but all including the socialist among them believe that the expanded role of the state make it all the more necessary to support private voluntary association to do what the state could not or should not do
and the main thing the state could not do be what walter besant the fabian socialist define as the principle of the new philanthropy
this return us once more to the concept of citizenship as green and his disciple understand it
a citizen be not a subjectnot even the subject of a benevolent state
toynbee be as opposed to tory or paternalistic socialism as he call it as to marxist or continental socialism
he be oppose to both because they both violate the essential principle of citizenship which be also the essential principle of positive freedom that citizen should be free to cultivate their best self and to pursue the common good
historian often use such word as vague and illogical ambivalent and ambiguous transitional and halfway house to describe this generation of philanthropist reformer and social philosopher
the implication be that latevictorian england can only be understand as a prelude to the welfare state or as some historian would have it a prelude to socialism and that anything short of that be vague ambiguous transitional and halfway
this assumption that the welfare state or socialism represent the logical necessary rational culmination of social policy be a typical symptom of what have be call the whig fallacy tendency to read the past in the light of the present to see history as a progressive movement of event institution and principle
if most victorian demur at a large extension of state control if they persist in expend their energy and resource on private voluntary philanthropy it could only be the argument go because of their commitment to a outmoded ideology or vested interest or because of a failure of imagination or will or in the most sophisticated version of this theory because the administrative apparatus of the state be incapable of cope with the economic and social need of the time
this mode of read history do justice neither to the past nor to the present
it do not begin to appreciate the victorian their problem and more subtle and sophisticated thought than we sometimes give them credit for
there be in fact very few criticism currently make of them that they do not anticipate and try to address not only criticism of their policy and institution but of themselves personally their motive and behavior
read their book and memoir one be strike by how modern so many of them sound in their sensitivity to accusation selfaccusations for the most part of condescension complacency callousness obtuseness selfishness
this be not to say that they be paragon of virtue or sensibility
but many of them most of the more prominent oneswere at least as thoughtful analytic and selfcritical as their counterpart today
in one respect they be more admirable than their successor
to use a unvictorian metaphor they put their money where their mouth were more than their money their career and life
at no other time do so many people of distinction give so much of themselves be see as a flaw
just as private voluntary institution be regard as inferior to public compulsory one so the voluntary unpaid social worker be consider amateurish compare with the paid professional and the philanthropist ineffectual compare with the government official
it may be argue however that the modern mode be not all that superior to the victorian one in practical term and far less superior less estimable in personal and moral term
professionalization as we have painfully discover breed bureaucratization and both produce their own peculiar variety of inefficiency and insensitivity
if whig history do less than justice to the past it also do more than justice to the present
have our present progressive social institution and arrangement give us that much cause for selfcongratulation be we so confident of the superiority of our own system of welfare that we can afford to be condescending to the victorian be we so satisfy with the result of the welfare state to say nothing of socialism more vigorously in that direction be the situation of our own underclass so much better than that of the submerged tenth that jane addams encounter on her first trip to london and when we agonize over the social pathology as we say of the underclass breakup of the family the prevalence of drug crime illiteracy and illegitimacy the compulsion for instant gratification and the inability to defer gratification are we not implicitly invoke the kind of middleclass value indeed victorian value with which we reproach the victorian it be worth keep such question in mind as we pass judgment on those victorian philanthropist and reformer whom we speak of rather derisively as moralist
""
those victorian exemplify by the founder of toynbee hall and of hull house be avowedly unashamedly incorrigibly moralist
they be moralist on their own behalfthey found toynbee hall and hull house in good part to satisfy their own moral need whom they seek to elevate morally spiritually culturally and intellectually as well as materiallywhom moreover they assume to be capable of and desirous of such elevation
to one historian this be evidence of a authoritarian disposition
to this historian it suggest a eminently democratic one

in a photograph as a upperclassman edmund wilson appear austere and purposeful look as if he have be study more than be socially desirable at princeton
he believe that he could subject himself to the control of his mind could make himself do what he think he should be do
in this way of think wilson be strongly influence by secularized eraser instead of apply himself to the page of homer before him he grandiloquently despaired calvin i understand you jonathan edwards you be justify
but he also make life fun for his literary friend for he love joke parody and literary hoax
enter into the majority princeton he write the book for the triangle show call the evil eye
red haired eager tireless he bubble with idea and throw them out by the handful christian gauss recall of his student and future friend
he be carry the war into the country of the philistine as gauss put it defend the standard of the intellectual minority in editorial about the curriculum and the social system
in temperament and taste wilson s friend range widely

he have believe latin boring on account of succeed in discover catullus s love poem and the eclogue and georgics of virgil
in the evening he read tibullus with mackie
i have never know anyone droller or more sensitive to literature wilson recall in old age
bill have a racy wit and be a master of pepys s diary style he describe his summer read in a eighteenthcentury script and manner that might fool us be it not for the reference to maximum nordau s degeneration and other book of the s
edmund however be uneasy over bill s reading without even a system or aim over the miscellaneous pile of book strew on the floor of his room when he drift away from literature wilson be disappointed but not surprised
at the other extreme be john wyeth the pure aesthete of the class who seem all too willing to leave the real world to the philistine
wyethwho become a painter like his famous relativesplayed debussy late into the advent of world war i by rent a cottage in the chateau district of france and amuse himself play the piano
he be the one who teach wilson how to read henry james
near the end of his life he recall how edmund and he by some mystery elect to a club discuss literature and art at dinner alone among the socialite and jock wilson not in the least intimidated
there be something wonderful about him wyeth say
the campus writer wilson think most talented be stanley dell his friend from hill john peale bishop who succeed him as editor of the magazine and scott fitzgerald who enter the group through his friendship with john
dell be a sophisticate who have live much abroad
a student of philosophy he write with a clarity and sensitivity that seem to have all the making of a novelist
bishop be a southerner with a self assurance that his friend consider aristocratic he be something of a dandy and a libertine he derive his romanticism from swinburne and shelley but before he leave college he be imitate yeats and pound
wilson and bishop first regard fitzgerald with the ambivalence of bookish undergraduate toward a manipulator bend on social success
in wilson s attitude there be a measure of snobbery toward someone who be both a practicing catholic and a product of the middle west latter circumstance from which fitzgerald rather suffer though he romanticize it at the end of the great gatsby
one day as reader of the dedicatory poem for the crackup know scott leave at wilson s door a story of a bohemian artist call shadow laurel which for all its romantic cliche have a lyric power
correct the spelling and syntax wilson publish the story in the lit in the spring of 
another time he come on fitzgerald wait for him in his room a creature strange to college intently pinch out his pimple in the mirror that reflect his pale
wilson would always admire the assurance that be part of fitzgerald s narcissistic strain
that summer scott be do the lyrics for the triangle show while edmund struggle with the libretto and the next fall these two with bishop and dell be in the same preceptorial of christian gauss s french course
by the time that fitzgerald withdraw from college under cover of illness to avoid academic suspension a basis have be lay for his and wilson s friendship after the war as they emerge in the complementary role of artist and critic
fitzgerald s imaginative gift and his resilience would enable him to profit by wilson s biting criticism of his first novel
as upperclassman these literati grow critical of the princeton social system
this be the indian summer of the college custom era in our campus life gauss write
freshman still have to wear black cap and jersey and stay away from the elegant club building on prospect street until the election in the spring of the sophomore year defend in the princetonian
fitzgerald the outsider who identify the gentlemanly ideal of the college with the pageantry he love could also apparently feel that they be hollow
the idol of the young hero of this side of paradise dick humbird who apparently can do anything and make it look right be kill when drive drunk and humbird later appear as the devil
when the president of the university object to his novel
fitzgerald reply that the whole social system be conceive uniquely for student without talent or imagination
""
john peale bishop s later portrait of princeton in the smart set end on a similar note
after defend its leisurely aristocratic life he confess at the last moment that if he should have a son of notable intelligence and promise he will lock him up in a library till he be old enough to send to paris
neither scott nor john say such thing about student
stanley dell however attack the religion of mediocrity in what purport to be a letter from a french graduate in the lit of 
intellectually independent and socially a insider a member of one of the best club dell laugh at the figure of the confident collegian justify the course of least resistance by a ideal he have himself create able to find in the big game the rush and the triangle show a alternative to learn in college
the essential issue for the intellectual minority at princeton during these year be the eating club
woodrow wilson have try to replace these with residential quad a aborted reform that set the pattern of his frustration as a political leader would be the subject of edmund s essay woodrow wilson at princeton
in college the critic recall i read and listen to wilson s speech and accept him as a shining champion in the war against sordid business a reformerintellectual in politics gt at first edmund have nothing against the club hall of good fellowship
as a sophomore he try not to get too nervous about the election and when dell s club pass him over ostensibly for lack of special ability or noticeable brain he be glad to go into a more modest one
he find that all he do there be eat and read the paper
john bishop make the same point state that the trouble with the club be that once in them they matter so little after have seem to matter so much
as a senior wilson conclude that the club be a barrier to the intellectual princeton he have come to believe in through his best professor
his objection be not egalitarian
he respect the yale senior society like skull and bone where intellectual ability be recognize and the selection come late enough in one s college career to be a incentive to merit
the princeton system on the other hand turn the first two college year into a quest for social approval that lot of fool cad and snob he declare in his final editorial in the lit
if say this do not make wilson popular in his class the minority for whom he speak be get strong
in more than a quarter of the sophomore class lead by dick cleveland the expresident s son refuse to join a club in a effort to bring the system down
he look on other aspect of college life with a humorous tolerance he may have acquire from bishop who be not so weary of college spirit as be dell
eventually however he attack those conservative who be commit to defend any custom hand down to them except perhaps the practice of throw snowball through the window into lecture room to get the professor s goat
the romanticization by many of the good old day provoke his best undergraduate prose
those be the day of happy carelessness the loos organization and the most perfunctory regard for the classroom
to suggest as their only redeeming feature
a procession be hold at midnight to celebrate halley s comet a doctor s excuse could be have for a quarter when one do not like a lecturer on prevent him from talk when one be bore by a preacher one cut him short by cough
we have mention elsewhere that triumphant cry engrave forever on the pavement of dickinson street who win the rush 
fancy the time when people care for such thing but how naive how merry they must have be those be the day of boyishness fresh and unaffected that is they be day of prevalent drunkenness cheat in examination intellectual cowardice and repression indiscriminate mockery general ignorance and the branding as a sad bird of anyone who try to rise above it
this be what wilson mean when in old age he say i enjoy the pleasant princeton life except when my reforming zeal would come to the surface
as editor he with shaw and well as immediate model
witty and fervent they have the lucidity and conversational ease of his mature criticism
wilson also write literary essay and short story set to verse his thought about the artist and education and recorded undergraduate life and talk in his journal
in addition to this one on james he write essay on stendhal and huysmans
as a sophomore he experience the hereditary anglosaxon trepidation i xxn the presence of a french immorality and decadence he find more attractive than he care to say
he condescend to stendhal s worldly irony in a piece that in old age wilson call hypocritical guff state that he have much admire stendhal
a unpublished manuscript on huysmans locate this apostle of bohemian freedom in a suffocating cul de sac
he lament huysmans s inability to create character outside himself describe his story as the second rate tragedy of a man pervert by too much culture and bored to death by civilization
these be solipsistic aspect of modernism in axel s castle where proust be say to have put into practice the regime which huysmans invent for his hero
during this time wilson s poem be already a outlet for the private reflection he would try to keep out of his criticism
they contain his thought about the heroism of writer and artists swift the dark hour whistler at battersea the drama of education
princeton by night apparently the sleeping college be in fact a stage where learn life and human soul find birth
to bellinger he confess the fear that i have nt much distinction in the use of wordsnot for poetic purpose anyhow
the journal he begin in england would become a source of his writing in other form
the college year contain interesting detail
the protestant freethinker take note when scott fitzgerald remark i can go up to new york on a terrible party and then come back and go into the a effete insipid undergraduate life be also visible in this potpourri of descriptive passage list of expression book title remark the young man think pointed or witty enough to set down
on the other hand the act of record experience on the page be important to wilson whose memory for detail of personality and scene would be the source of much of his lasting work
some of his fiction reflect his uneasy relationship with his parent
in one story a ostensible expose of the dullness of new jersey life a boy s father die liberate the son to contemplate a ambition very different from his father s and to explore the world at least as far as the corner drug store
in the oedipal triangle of below stair publish in the june wilson graduate a jockey be hire by his boss to run away with the man s wife and not return
when the two fall in love and return to new york catastrophe follow the hero ineffectually try the wife reading of her lover s fate in the newspaper repudiate this evil world for a convent
below stair suggest how little he know of girl his own age the debutante whom his friend be take to dance
he be aware of a certain awkwardness in these story
to bellinger he report that teek whipple come in and burst into roar of laughter at the sentence i have write which be my god girl say the doctor
we do nt wear wig in america and really one can hardly blame him because it be certainly a little startling out of its context
that he have to work at his fiction with a strain that his critical writing lack would not modify wilson s ambition in this genre
when wilson in the early twenties look back on princeton in a article on the ivy league school he evoke not the social atmosphere that his friend write about but a humanistic ideal
if the muchtalkedof social would survive where one could read plato in greek and with the appreciation of a peer
twenty year later he write that in my youth you read shakespeare shelley george meredith dostoevsky ibsen and you want however imperfectly and on however infinitesimal a scale to learn their trade and have the freedom of their company
this be not a arbitrary listshakespeare and shelley have also make their mark on him
the sense of meet the great writer on their own level distinguish this literary generation from its successor produce by american university
appreciation and emulation be for them as closely connect as be criticism and imaginative writing
eliot stevens and pound be follow by dos passos and cummings at harvard wilson fitzgerald and their friend at princeton
after fitzgerald s death dos passos remark that he have raise the level of american fiction to follow in some such way as marlowe s blank verse line raise the whole level of elizabethan verse
their undergraduate literary education be important to life
this be conspicuously true of wilson give his shortcircuited connection with his father
at school he have turn to the fierce but benign discipline of his greek teacher mr rolfe and in college he find hero in christian gauss and norman kemp smith who would turn out to be lifetime friend
gauss be then thirtyfive and a outsider in genial princeton
in his old raincoat pass by on the walk with pale cheek and shuttered gaze sometimes accompany by a shabby mongrel dog name baudelaire he have a air of the nineties for the campus writershe be know to have be a journalist in paris and shared drink with oscar wilde
he make a formidable impression in the lecture course on dante have the same command of the classroom as of the subject
he expound on dante s code of loyalty to the truth no matter where it lead or whom it hurt and the idea of il ben del intelletto that good of the intellect poet s art be polish and carefully plan and know how to make its point and the meaning of the point it be make
for gauss dante convey the whole spectrum of human passion in a orderly vision that imply also a reasoned morality and he make his student feel that no englishman could have accomplish this even shakespeare
his bete noire be robert browning whom he portray as a tonedeaf beefeater concoct facile moral drama in italy while dante s ghost look on in wry disdain
in private gauss would admit to have acquire a lot of bad doctrine from browning in youth
this be the future critic s introduction to the continental aesthetic which give the writer of the twenties perspective on english literature and a way to see their native material
dante have much the same value for eliot and pound different as they be from each other as well as from wilson
flaubert be the writer who take this standard into modern idea of the world
when gauss lecture on flaubert in his french course wilson recall he make us all want to write something in which every word every cadence every detail should perform a definite function in produce a intense effect
edmund be soon emulate the search for le mot juste in his journal
after the war he would exhort fitzgerald to practice flaubert s objectivity and irony advice that help to shape the novelist s development between this side of paradise and the great gatsby something that wilson later politely attribute to gauss s influence
gauss s french course help lay the basis for edmund wilson s criticism
begin with voltaire and rousseau the professor expound the romantic the philosophy of naturalism the symbolism of the fin de siecle much as wilson do in the background chapter of axel s castle
he teach michelet as well as renan
taine and anatole france all of whom would at one time later historiancritics as victim of a palsying pessimism somewhat as wilson do in the first section of to the finland station
gauss introduce the young man to saintebeuve whom edmund want to emulate until impatience with the gossipy journalistic aspect of the causeries de lundi send him to arnold to whom saintebeuve owe so much
in voltaire he find the essence of the wit and irony he enjoy in flaubert and other french writer and voltaire also exemplify the ideal of the enlightenment make him want to be a soldier in the liberation war of humanity
it can be argue that johnson s life of the poet and boswell s life influence the critic more than anything in voltaire just as arnold s effect on him match that of saintebeuve and taine
in youth however he be rebel against the british tradition which be less consciously aesthetic and more politically conservative than the french
france have the attraction of be a though he work at the writer with dictionary in hand
later in life he would grow into his inheritance from the english
gauss s teaching method also make wilson aspire to a encyclopedic knowledge and to the historical point of viewone that remain more congenial to him than what he would see as the obscurantism and dogma of many theorist
gauss talk about personality as well as text
he believe that moral issue be real which make him a effective interpreter of french aestheticism to a morally earnest young man
the artist s code be not he say that of the citizen or the churchgoer
when edmund define as humane a impulse to avoid tell a friend who want to contribute to the lit that his manuscript be terrible gauss suggest the right word be weak
in preceptorials he usually confine himself to socratic questioning
when he ask where beauty justice goodness and other value come from and wilson reply out of the imagination of be correct
it be a memorable moment for the student who fifteen year later use this phrase in criticize eliot s assertion that civilization depend on the christian church
gauss share the enlightenment philosophy that the world be real and that we ourselves may find some sense in it and make ourselves happy in it that wilson take as his own
after world war i wilson would go down from new york to princeton to visit christian gauss and they would exchange letter but in his college year theirs be not a personal relationship
he know gauss only in class and in casual campus conversation
revere him from afar he bring a driving intensity to the idea and ideal that they share project onto the professor a promethean ambition
wilson do not have the same stake in his more informal relationship with the philosopher norman kemp smith
kemp smith sometimes invite student to sunday dinner follow by a country walk
they be not ordinary social occasion for the scotsman do not speak of his own innocent child might cause him to speculate about the possibility of innate idea
edmund enjoy his wit
kemp smith say that a professor of his acquaintance be drive out of the parish in disgrace by the congregation of the little scotch country church in which he have be preach because he say in one of his sermon that the weather be almost certainly not manage by providence but probably the result of natural conditions this be a note in wilson s journal
although kemp smith apparently believe in god he remark that if you be not persuade of immortality you ought not to allow yourself to be convinced b y the death of a favorite daughter
it be what edmund have tell himself several year early when a aged preacher at hill say that the boy would come to share his point of view when they be old enough
a serious thinker in the secularized calvinist tradition of which wilson too be a product kemp smith be intellectually the most impressive age as gauss he be already a recognized authority on descartes and in he be work on what remain the standard translation of kant s critique of pure reason
he would later expound the skepticism of hume
his lecture be a systematic exploration of everything from the nature of man s knowledge of the external world to aesthetics
he know enough literature to base a argument on wordsworth and speak of the personality of boswell and hume as well as their idea
he be also interested in science idea and newsin everything that man be do
philosophy have always mean for him everything that man have think
such a man leave his mark
he would not be a professional model for wilson be never a theorist or system builder
he could admire kemp smith s mind while observe its paradoxical relationship to the everyday world as when in class the professor have just disprove the existence of sound when his lecture be interrupt by a brass band outside the window
s view that one make the life significant out of personal effort
wilson would keep in touch with these teacher
in gauss he have find a second intellectual father and a sounding board
in the dedication to axel s castle he would acknowledge a debt to gauss s lecture and endorse his view of criticism as the history of man s idea and imagining in the setting of the condition which have shape them
wilson conceive of artist as antenna of the racemuch like poundnegotiating new experience and help humanity to move ahead
gauss would have subscribe to the idea
with kemp smith his relationship be similarly durable
they correspond and though the philosopher go to edinburgh to assume the chair of logic and metaphysics wilson manage to visit from time to time even as late as 
ten year later kemp smith write to his former student contrast santayana s muddled theorizing to the fascinating autobiography that give a key to his complex makeup observation the historical interpretation of literature give at princeton in wilson cite kemp smith in support of the view that the critic s authority be ultimately personal l that his judgement rest on the emotional satisfaction that derive from the imposition of form on the pain and disorder of reality
sum up his own aesthetic he write this relief that bring the sense of power and with the sense of power joy be the positive emotion which tell us that we have encounter a firstrate piece of literature
the idealistic student cherish his vision of what princeton might be although his friend generally consider it at odds with the reality
he see himself not so much as a marginalized member of a minority as one of the majority for whom he speak even as he attempt to direct their interest and taste often against their own inclination
to occupy this position within the institutional structure of the college be good practice for a lifetime effort to extend artistic and intellectual standard man in the street could be enlighten about proust and joyce about marx and the revolutionary tradition about the dead sea scroll and the literature of the civil war never defer to the limitation of this common reader s vision
he would not assume a adversarial relationship to a antiintellectual culture as would most of the intellectual elite of postworld war ii america
his college year have give him a sense of continuity with the great writer of the past a belief that their work could be carry on and make new in his own time
his be a privileged education derive from a class that value literature and art and have some leverage on public affair
he would be able to make use of it outside the milieu in which he have grow up and be already commit to open up to others the intellectual experience that it make available to him
his last review in the lit be a appreciation of the account of a man who have work his way through college a in the army he look back nostalgically to princeton in his poem
after world war i however it seem impossible to have sentimental emotion about any situation and princeton fade for him during the twenties
the last class reunion he attend be a drunken affair in which he describe in a new republic piece about the disillusioning effect of the war on his generation
in the thirties when wilson be attack capitalism from the left all that remain of his youthful ideal be satire i too have fake the glamor of gray tower i to have sing the ease of sultry hour clean wood wide playingfield smooth pond where clean boy train to sell their country s bond
in a sense his relationship with gauss have replace the institutional tie and gauss s death in sever wilson s loyalty though he live pleasantly off nassau street when give the gauss lecture two year later
in the modern technological princeton his impression be that the be accentuate because the university never give him any money something wilson always need the princeton university library chronicle pay him fifty dollar for thought on be bibliographed a essay as valuable in its own time as emerson s american scholar
when he resort to sell his paper to pay overdue income tax it be yale s beinecke library that buy them
he remain loyal to the literary friend with whom he set forth into the world even when they disappoint him
john biggs a friend of fitzgerald s who give up realistic fiction to become a lawyer then a distinguished federal judge give up too much in wilson s eye
when dell fail to pursue literature when bishop s writing still largely imitative fail to flower he attribute it to problem in their private livesbishop s marriage dell s long analysis with jung
he preach art to them for its own sake and as a way of deal with their problem
now be would write to fitzgerald in when scott s life be disintegrate and he be begin to feel hopelessly inferior to the novelist whom he have help on his way
wilson s ambition for others and proclivity as a cheerleader color his conception of the role of a critic
that his talent be for interpretive expository writing make it easy for his creative energy to sustain themselves through all the confusion of his life while the energy of his novelist and poet friend fade
in old age wilson once talk of a unwritten work perhaps in novel formhe think he might not live to do it would consist of a round of visit among the blasted comrade of his youth
it be the language of the nineties the era that first set the image of the artist for this college generation
as a senior at princeton edmund concoct with scott and john for a parody of the fin de siecle the last remain of edward moore gresham
in make up the poet s sad and his literary remains he could never have imagine he would one day address to the dead fitzgerald a poem beginning scott your last fragment i arrange tonight

wilson s loyalty reflect the cloistered nature of his college world
he neither smoke nor drink take one glass of champagne at the yearly banquet of his club
in his class poll the future inveterate pursuer of woman be name most likely bachelor
he sometimes hope that his power as a writer would win him the woman of his dream
in a goodnatured letter to bellinger in whom he continue to confide he imagine come upon this marvelous creature in a moonlit scene in venice read my last novel
wilson s reverie continue
how do you like the book it be pretty darn good be it not i blurt out
no she reply in a lovely voice it be the sad stuff that ever i read

even
the comedy continue
he reveal he be the authorexpecting her to express a better opinion of the novel immediately which she do nt

john and alec go off with the girl while scott and i take a walk down the hill to the lake
that be one thing exclaim scott that fitzgerald be never do if edmund be not bind by a catholic conscienceeven such a porous one as scott have claimedhe lack his friend s confident charm
my feminine ideal at this time he write when look back upon his journal be not the kind of girl those lovely and slender brunette capable of serious interest for whom the hero of hg well abandon their passive wife
when i stay in hotel i would dream of amour with complaisant chambermaid but i would not have have the least idea how to initiate one

as graduation approach he become impatient with the unreality of college life and experience familiar to american student
he have no idea how to support himself as his father have long be insist he would have to do
stanley dell and he have be to summer school at columbia after their junior year study sociology and labor problem and he have a notion of do political journalism in washington
but these idea be not very concrete
wilson s lifelong intellectual absorption come at the cost of a certain abstraction and incompetence in practical affairshe would never learn to drive a car regularly take taxi more than once for hundred of mile
one be always conscious of this dichotomy a old friend recall and dedication to the scope and power and dedication of his mind at the same time that one look down at his childlike inability to wrestle with the knubbly fact of life

i want to be one of the greatest writer who ever live do nt you fitzgerald remark to him not long after they leave college
it be a aspiration he could not share since as he say to himself scott have be read hg well and compton mackenzie when he have be read plato and dante
yet he have a ambitious conception of the future of their literary group one that would eventually embrace his literary generation
in he write in his journal princeton be a kind of prelude before the action of the opera have begin when the leitmotif which be to dominate the rest of the performance be quietly sound as if in play

edmund wilson sr nurse his hypochondria in a sanitarium do not come to his son s graduation they talk of his future it be surprising how his father understand and accept him
do nt you think you ought to concentrate on something the senior wilson ask without however mention money or earn a living
father he reply what i want to do be to try to get to know something about all the main department of human thought
edmund gratefully remember that his father do not even smile at this nor venture any of the obvious objection that such a statement invite
that be a possible ambition he say
go ahead if you be really serious

by lewis m dabney
lewis m dabney be professor of english at the university of wyoming and the editor of the portable edmund wilson
this essay be derive from edmund wilson to make a american culture the first volume of a critical biography to be publish by farrar straus giroux
according to the summary report doctorate recipient from united state university publish by the national research council new phd
s be award in 
fortyfour percent of those doctorate be in field of science and engineering percent in the life science percent in the physical science and percent in engineering
other large group come from education percent and the social science percent
the humanities and professional field business administration social work theology and others account for percent and percent respectively
while this distribution by field hold no surprise a special section on timetodegree highlight some disturbing trend
first the median time spend in complete a phd
have be rise steadily for twenty year to its present year including year of registered study
but the time require to proceed from a baccalaureate to a doctorate also vary significantly from field to field it take appreciably long year of registered time and the humanities year than in the science and engineering all of which fall well below the average engineering year physical science year and life science year
what do these figure mean and why should we care we should care warn leader in education industry and government because the projected need for highly train specialist in most of the specified field can not be satisfy in the s by the current number of phd
s which have be fairly stable for the past fifteen year
to meet increasing national and world requirement we must attract more student into our graduate school and we must get them through more efficiently
what the figure mean however be another matter altogether one that can be explain more satisfactorily by history than by statistical analysis
at the beginning of this century many people in the united state be worry that there would be
in william james publish a article deplore the increasing hold of the phd
octopus upon american life
james s powerful metaphor of the octopus have long dominate discussion of the phd
in the united state arouse archetypal image of a dark brooding presence strangle our student our campus and indeed the intellectual life of the nation in its tentacle
the image may have occur to james because in much of which he spend in england a unusual plague of octopi off the southern coast of england attract a good deal of public attention
forty year later in a reprise of james s piece in teacher in america jacques barzun observe that james be inspire when he speak of a octopus that describe its flabbiness its ubiquity and the squirting of ink which be its main reflex
according to barzun nothing have change since the turn of the century
the octopus have the young teacher in its grip and do mania have take over the country yet barzun claim after see degree holder and read their thesis it be hard to say what the title show
in a thorough and judicious study graduate education in the united state bernard berelson state that james be concerned lest the phd
octopus crush the true spirit of learn in the university and quote james s essay at length because his observation and comment reveal so well the timelessness of some issue of graduate study
to this day the phd
octopus be still invoke formulaically in discussion of graduate education and national life
james however have in mind no such broad target as phd
mania or the true spirit of learning
he compose his essay with a very specific aim to call attention to misuse of the phd
by what he label the doctormonopoly in teaching
write toward the end of the period when educational leader like at clark and charles w eliot at harvard be strive to create the first major research university in the united state he feel that the degree be in danger of be reduce to a mere advertising resource especially by the president and trustee of small institution seek to compensate for the lack of distinction in their faculty
its most immediate effect be to keep many qualified but undoctored teacher out of our college
will anyone pretend for a moment james ask that the doctor s degree be a guarantee that its possessor will be successful as a teacher
james be voice a concern that trouble a good many educator around the turn of the century
five year later james s harvard colleague irving babbitt in literature and the american college bemoan the fetish worship of the doctor s degree on the part of certain college president
babbitt believe that this acceptance of the doctor s degree as proof of fitness for a chair of literature to dehumanize literary study and fix on our college a philological despotism
at princeton the dean of the graduate school himself andrew fleming west express his regret that the phd
be become a employment badge like a union card in the graduate college of princeton 
the controversy about the value of a phd
for a career in college teaching be therefore a classic one extend from james by way of babbitt and west to barzun and beyond down to today s disgruntled teaching assistant who look around to see that he or she be do most of the work of instruction at many university while the highly pay professor who already have phd
s be teach only rarefied graduate seminar if teach at all
to suggest the extent of the concern today a twoday walkout of teach assistant on the berkeley campus of the university of california in the spring of cause the cancellation of nearly percent of class
""
for all james college teaching he a md and scientist who have train graduate student in physiology psychology and philosophy at harvard among them g stanley hall and w e b du boi do not question the value of the phd
as a degree certify ability in research
our high degree be institute for the laudable purpose of stimulating scholarship especially in the form of original research
while he recognize the danger of institutionalization on a large scale to develop a tyrannical machine with unforeseen power of exclusion and corruption he support both the phd
as a degree and the graduate school as a institution it be well for a country to have research in abundance and our graduate school do but apply a normal psychological spur
""
but other factor be involve here
when james write his essay he be a tenured professor on the point of retirement follow a distinguished career
he do not feel personally threaten by the research scholar with their phd
abroad ill at ease with german scientific method
it be no accident that many of the president who stimulate graduate education in this country be themselves scientist who have also study in germany the physical geographer gilman the chemist eliot and the psychologist hall
from the very start the phd
be largely a degree for scientist intend as the yale faculty put it in to enable us to retain in this country many young man and especially student of science who now resort to german university for advantage of study no great than we be able to afford
the proportion of degree award over the year show that this tactic be successful
by the physical and biological science account for more than half of the phd
s award in the united state
the social science make haste to emulate the science through the quantification of their method as do the humanities through a turn from appreciation to methodological and historical rigor
the scientist be positivistic training and research
the principal opponent of the phd
be humanist whose work do not lend itself so smoothly to scientific method
babbitt still a untenured assistant professor with a master s degree when he publish literature and the american college feel distinctly menace by the phd
s with whom president eliot be staff harvard s department
not content with james s pragmatic argument against the doctormonopoly in teaching babbitt attack the degree itself on the moral ground that the work that lead to a doctor s degree be a constant temptation to sacrifice one s growth as a man to one s growth as a specialist
the classicist andrew fleming west less defensive than babbitt although he also have no doctorate seek to combat what he regard as the unenlightened specialization of the new breed by create at princeton his graduate college a residence for a community of graduate student who live together would be infect by the contagion of knowledge
""
babbitt be also afflict by a rabid antigermanism which lead him to regard the phd
as a german incubus to rail against german doctor and to claim that the uncritical adoption of german method be one of the chief obstacle to a humanistic revival
babbitt almost certainly do not realize that he be recapitulate a debate whose term have be exhaustively explore by german thinker ever since schiller in his inaugural address at the university of jena in make the classic distinction between brotgelehrte the specialist who want to learn nothing that would distract them from the field in which they intend to earn their living and the philosophical mind who see knowledge as a whole and integrate their particular interest into that unity
babbitt go well beyond james in challenge the worth of the phd
altogether and he have be follow by others who often unwittingly but nonetheless wrongly attribute that humanist disdain of the degree itself to james
in the realpolitik of like business administration agriculture home economics physical education and recreation it be naive to believe that what james call our three magic letter certify anything resemble the humanist notion of culture
today american university including the best one award the phd
to foreign student who can barely speak english to us student who can not understand a foreign language to humanist who have no grasp of mathematical or statistical or scientific reasoning and to scientist and engineer who can barely construct a coherent paragraph of english prose
graduate school can not aspire to compensate for the educational and cultural deficiency that student have bring along from secondary school and undergraduate college
the phd
do not pretend to certify a command of the calculus or latin or us history or french literature that a student should have obtain early in life
the role of the university as a cultural agent in our society have decline proportionately as the university have become less unify in its vision and its constituency and more of student from the most varied background and career interest
in such a educational system the phd
can be no more but should also be no less than one welldefined step in the process lead from college through graduate school and into postdoctoral career whether within the university or outside
what the phd
do certify and usually quite creditably be a degree of competence regarding the organization and method of a general field of study for example history or physics and a solid command of the chosen field of specialization for example german history of the sixteenth century or string theory
it be a matter of expectation you do not expect the holder of a new driver s license for passenger car to be able to handle a ox cart or a eighteenwheeler
but you would reasonably expect him to understand the historical link between the ox cart and the automobile as well as the theoretical analogy between steer the passenger vehicle and the truck
however expertise in these road aircraft
whether the recipient of a phd
be a brilliant generalist or a tedious nerd be essentially irrelevant to the ability certify by the graduate program with its degree
the same apply to the pedagogical qualification of the doctorate
the newly certify phd like his graduate school professor may be dazzling in the classroom or a unhappy tribulation for his student
today many graduate student especially in the humanities and social science have too much not too little teach experience by the time they receive their degree unvaried unsupervised and poorly remunerated experience
but those ability be not guarantee by the degree
none of these characteristic stand in any necessary relationship to the other
the prodigiously learn generalist may be a prodigious bore while the specialist with no interest beyond the narrow bound of his field may through his very obsession captivate his student
in sum the term of the debate as establish by james and babbitt have become largely irrelevant to current discussion regarding be unimportant just that they be misplace if address to the phd
per se
as desirable as a wellrounded knowledge of one s field of specialization may be and as important as it be to have excellent teacher in college classroom those problem can not be solve by the phd
alone which exist as james well know for related but distinctly different purpose
discussion about reform of the degree should take care not to discard what be good and distinctive about the phd
by seek to make it serve too many purpose
for better or bad the phd
have increasingly be regard as desirable by american society even in field where such certification might be think irrelevant such as music composition
i note one amusing exception i be recently petition unavailingly by a graduate student in physics to change the title of his princeton degree from doctor of philosophy to doctor of science on the ground that in the soviet union where he be born the marxist trash forcibly hammer into every head
""
in james write that graduate school still be something of a novelty and high diploma something of a rarity
in fact only phd
s be award in the united state that year and according to the national academy of science survey a century of doctorate barely altogether have be bestow since 
but the situation change rapidly
the number of phd
s have roughly double each decade in this century at a rate considerably more rapid than the population as a whole bring the annual total today to the low thirty thousand where it have stabilize since the early s
it have be estimate that by half of one percent of the us population hold a doctorate
the phd
have not just multiply it have also spread
almost percent of the doctorate award in be concentrate in the fourteen founding member of the association of american university the phd
s in be grant by some institution
the dispersal of university now award the degree be indicate by the fact that today even the top forty doctorategranting institution begin with the flagship campus of the state university of california wisconsin illinois texas and michigan account for not quite half of them
the phd
octopus be well and thriving
indeed for the contemporary situation the generally small timid octopus which tend to confine itself mainly to coastal water provide a image less compelling than another cephalopod the large aggressive and highly mobile squid with two prehensile arm in addition to its eight grasping tentacle
today most college and university still decorate their catalogue with title which in james s word bespangle the page as if they be sprinkle over it from a pepper caster and it be not likely that their titular ambition will wane
it would confirm james s bad fear to know that the widely consult peterson phd
s on the faculty of each institution list
despite the huge increase in phd
s the demand still outstrip the supply
the calamari to give the squid its gastronomic designation be regard as a delicacy and not just in those exotic part of the world that send their student in increasing number to pursue their graduate study in our university but also in the gourmet restaurant favor by the expenseaccount representative of the nonacademic world that be bid for large and large share of the phd
market
when james and babbitt be write they have in mind principally the effect that the influx of phd
s would have on the american college as they know it
but the phd
be no long primarily a teaching degree especially in the science and engineering
only half of today s phd
s be accept academic employment as compare to almost percent just ten year ago
in according to the summary report percent of percent into government and more than percent into other sector for example elementary and secondary school nonprofit foundation selfemployment
the taste for squid be spread to the extent that some of the rare academic variety be virtually be pursue with drift net
as survey by the american council for education have recently show college and university be already experience increasing difficulty in their effort to identify and recruit faculty member especially in business computer science mathematics economics the natural science and the health profession
a major report by william g bowen and julie ann sosa prospect for faculty in the art science project a increasing discrepancy between the supply and the demand in many other discipline in the coming decade
this shortage result from several factor
first despite what bowen and sosa identify as the striking flight from the art and science during the seventies from percent of total degree confer in to only onequarter in and be expect to increase slightly in the s in response to the slackening interest in engineering among undergraduate the increasing emphasis on the liberal art not only in liberal art college but also at such technological institution as mit and the public concern with question of ethics and value
second bowen and sosa point out that the anticipated steady supply in the number of new phd
s will not suffice to replenish faculty rank although they demonstrate contrary to popular opinion that there will be no dramatic bunching of faculty retirement in the nineties and that the retirement will have varying effect in different field and type of institution
in fact some university be already begin to stockpile phd
s against that anticipated imbalance of supply and demand
third the proportion of us citizen receive american phd
s have be declining from more than percent in to only percent in 
while many foreign student plan to remain in this strong competition for our phd
s from abroad as other country intensify their investment in science and technology
finally the steady growth of big science in federal and industrial laboratory as well as in university will absorb more and more highly train researcher in such field as superconductivity space exploration and medical research
even though james s gentle octopus have metamorphose itself into the large invertebrate know to man the supply be still not adequate to meet the increasingly ravenous demand from institution and nation compete among themselves for phd
s
in the light of this problem the debate over specialization versus generalization or teach versus research seem rather quaint
how have this situation develop since the number of phd
s award annually in the united state have more than triple from to a total last year of 
that figure might suggest that student be enter graduate school in adequate number to meet the demand
but most of the growth have take place by stop because for a variety of reason the demand for phd
s both within and without the university decline
university which have fill their rank with new and young professor in the s in response to the matriculation of the babyboom generation realize that they have enough and in some field too many teacher for the small birth cohort reach college age in the late seventies and eighties
in some field specifically the oil and aerospace industry economic factor cause a decline in the demand for certain kind of engineer and scientist
at the same time start salary in other field begin to reach such height that college graduate accept job immediately after school or enter more immediately gratifying twoyear mba
program with a quicker payoff
for these reason and despite certain social achievement for example the proportion of woman increase to its current percent of american graduate student the proportion of us man decline steadily
to keep the number of graduate student at the minimal level require researchintensive field of science and engineering university begin recruit widely abroad
as a result in only percent of the phd
s in engineering be award to us citizen and only percent in the physical science
the current national graduate population of about million student might still seem to be a adequate pool in which ta cultivate squid
but most of those student be in professional or terminal master s program
far from all student who enter a doctoral program actually persevere to earn the degree
as many as percent of student who pass their general examination fail for one reason or another to complete the degree
attrition be notoriously difficult to measure because both the definition and the data be so vague
do the student drop out or do he or she switch field or institution do the student drop out for good or only long enough to earn some money or to have a child or to travel for purpose relate to education university have reliable statistics on student require to fill out a national survey form
but those who never finish rarely pause to explain why they drop out
even if substantial number of these graduate student intend to stop with a master s degree or have make a happy transition into another subject or into a professional school there be still enough disenchanted abd s all but dissertation out there concentrate in place like cambridge morningside height hyde park berkeley and other large academic community but visible everywhere to have create a limbo of aging graduate student a unhappy intellectual proletariat with its own mystique
from time to time one see on resume the designation abd as though it represent a degree actually receive
the phenomenon of the abd be by no means peculiar to the late twentieth century
two hundred year ago johann wolfgang goethe provide a precise model of the type
as a law student at the university of strasbourg in goethe as undisciplined as he be brilliant waste his as the deadline approach hastily patch together a dissertation which be straightway reject by his professor
on the basis of a oral examination he receive a license to practice law but no doctorate
of course a phd
be not necessary for success in life as william james well know goethe go on to do quite nicely for himself act among other capacity as minister for high education in the duchy of saxeweimar
moreover his revenge on the institution be sublime shortly after the rejection he write the section of faust in which the university and its practice be wickedly satirize by mephistopheles pose as a professor
by what james call this new class of american social failure have begin to emerge in this country
his most poignant word be reserve for these person whom he regard as the institution s victim
man without marked originality or native force but fond of truth and especially of book and study ambitious of reward and recognition poor position weak in the eye of their examiner among these we find the veritable chair a canon of the war of learning the unfit in the academic struggle for existence
forty year later barzun classify the species instructor aged fortyfive and fifty be find tread the mill at the point where they begin they find other post good bad or indifferent but never forget the cruel alma mater that take their best year and make them start anew in midcareer
circumstance have hardly improve
a few year ago a greeting card be circulate in university circle that feature a miserable creature with a hangdog expression under the inscription meet the bitter person in the world the grad school dropout
from time to time the new york time and the chronicle of high education print letter or oped piece in which disgruntled abd s savage the institution with which they have be unproductively associate for all too many year
ultimately both the recruitment of talented new graduate student ominous third factor timetodegree
the squid be not just large than the octopus it also have two arm that can reach out far than the eight tentacle the better to hold on long to the student once seize in its embrace
if any generalization about timetodegree be possible it be that it tend to increase
the summary report calculate that time to the phd
have increase by about percent over the last twenty year
while timetodegree vary appreciably from field to field and while it can be measure in different way either the total lapsed time between the baccalaureate and the doctorate what the statistician call ttd or just the actual period of registered graduate study rtd the time spend in complete the phd
have be rise steadily from year in to registered year in or from year in total time to year
put another way the average graduate student be currently well over thirty actually year old and have spend the time he or she finally receive the degree that entitle him or her to begin any career that specify the phd
as its prerequisite
they be just enter the labor market at a point when many of their contemporary in other profession be begin to calculate their retirement benefit
this have not always be the case
william james may have turn his elegant irony on the phd
as a prerequisite for college teaching but he do not question the time require to achieve it
in the example james cite at the beginning of his essay of the brilliant student of philosophy who have be work as a writer for three year and suddenly find that he need a phd
to take a position in english literature offer at a small institution the young man spend several week write a thesis on metaphysics and review his study so as to pass our formidable ordeal
the committee could not accept the hastily assembled work brilliancy and originality by themselves will nt save a thesis for the of learning
but unlike goethe james s protege be urge to pad out the thesis properly and to resubmit it and within a year he be able to fulfill all the requirement for the degree
while the overall timetodegree be fairly lengthy since the year of freelance writing would have be count the period of registered graduate study be quite short or in any case not significantly extend by the year need to pad out a acceptable dissertation
james s example be representative for that period
when yale decide in to offer the doctorate the requirement be simple at least two year of study on campus past the bachelor s degree a satisfactory final examination and a thesis give evidence of high attainment
the first three american phd
s be in due course award at yale in after just two year of postbaccalaureate study
in the decade following the founding of the first american research university at john hopkins in
octopus the doctorate remain a shortterm degree normally require only two or at most three year of postgraduate study
these expectation be share by the student
at the founding meeting of the federation of graduate club in the representative from various university recommend that the minimum requirement for the phd
should be two year of resident graduate study a general examination and a thesis
the establishment of national organization begin around lead to effort to standardize the degree
in the national association of state university and in the association of american university propose that the period of postgraduate study should ideally be three year
the american conception of the phd
have remain remarkably constant throughout most of the century
in the association of graduate school and the council of graduate school issue a joint statement summarize their view of the normal course of study lead to the doctorate a year or two of lecture and seminar follow by a general examination and a dissertation
the entire or at most four year beyond the baccalaureate
the fouryear norm have be affirm by most writer who have analyze the situation for example bernard berelson in graduate education in the united state and stephen h spurr in academic degree structure innorative approach 
while most graduate dean have strive quixotically to maintain the ideal of the fouryear phd reality have veer sharply away
indeed spurr calculate that only percent of graduate student in be complete their phd
s within four year of the baccalaureate
the available evidence in a nrc survey doctorate production in united state university suggest that the average total timetodegree for the student receive their phd
s in be year and that by it have increase to year
the data show certain variation
already in the pattern be evident that prevail today timetodegree be short in the physical science and the life science the field in average in the social science and appreciably long in the humanities
all field show a deviation downward from the trajectory during world war ii probably as a result of accelerated wartime program and again during the early s probably as a result of several vast postwar fellowship program
during the s the total timetodegree fall slightly because support possibility be very good and the war in vietnam make it attractive for student to maintain continuous enrollment
yet during that same period and probably for the same reason the registered timetodegree increase steadily from year in to year in and without a break in the curve to year in 
the spectrum be identical with that in range from the short degree time in the physical science to the lengthy in the humanities
""
various factor have be cite to account for the lengthening timetodegree in our doctoral program
in some field engineering or business and management for example the candidate be often expect the real world before enter or complete a graduate program but the period of registered study be not seriously extend
another factor cite for the statistical increase in timetodegree be the rise in the number of parttime student in graduate school
be it the case that fulltime student be finish in the same time while the statistics be change by the parttime student who take long while i have no national data at princeton timetodegree have be creep gradually upward from year in to year in and year in even though the graduate school admit only fulltime student and strive mightily to maintain a reasonable timetodegree
""
a third factor involve type of support
according to the summary report student with fellowship or research assistantship complete their degree significantly fast than those who support themselves with their own earnings or with family support or loan
but the report have no way of take into account the fact that student may receive fellowship because they be judge to than those who receive no such award
the amount of time spend teaching be another factor that vary from field to field
while teach assistant finish in year that is more slowly than those on fellowship and research assistantship but still well below the overall average in those field where teaching be most common notably in the humanities student who teach require year to finish
but the question still remain do these student take long to finish their work because they be teach more or be they teach more because they need long to finish their work especially in the science some professor also hold on to graduate student who have prove to be integral to a continuing research project
finally despite all the myth about the misery of abd status some graduate student seem to enjoy the way of life or at least prefer it to the uncertainty of the job market or the relegation to what they consider to be less desirable location or institution
the germany along with the phd
degree
all of these consideration be less important than change in disciplinary expectation
something can be do nationally and locally about graduate student support about parttime versus fulltime study about teach demand about exploitation of research assistant and about other external factor
disciplinary expectation on the other hand can be transform only from within the individual department
change here can have immediate result independent of such external factor as financial support or the job market
compare to the undergraduate curriculum which be determine by the faculty as a whole and the institution s image of itself graduate curriculum be set almost exclusively by individual department according to the expectation of the discipline for example the need for competence in latin or in statistics for archival research or the use of scientific equipment at distant location
the graduate faculty as a whole may set certain minimal requirement for example at least one year of residence or a certain number of course but the substance of the degree be determine almost wholly by the department
here matter have change little since the day of william james who note among his colleague two antagonistic passion one for multiply as much as possible the annual output of doctor the other for raise the standard of difficulty in passing so that the phd
of the special institution shall carry a high blaze of distinction than it do elsewhere
these antagonistic passion manifest themselves today in pressure with which every graduate dean be familiar to increase the number of graduate student in every department while at the same time extend the expectation and the time for the degree
high expectation for degree candidate involve the material to be master in the early phase of graduate study with the result that the date of the general examination have be push subtly back in some department especially in the humanities
but the very designation abd suggest that the central problem be locate mainly in the period follow the do research and write the thesis
sometimes attenuation be justify
in some field timeconsuming fieldwork be a prerequisite for adequate professional training
the ecologist need to be in africa when the zebra be mate the plant biologist in south america when the tree be fruit or the anthropologist in sri lanka long enough to win the confidence of the local population
in others the student need to spend month in archive or museum or foreign library collect material
but if the student have be thoughtfully advise and steer to a topic that be not unrealistically large or exotic then even that research away from campus should not require substantially more time than library and laboratory work on the home campus
it be not without significance that timetodegree almost precisely parallel the average length of dissertation by field
from to the present total timetodegree have consistently range from a low point in the physical science by way of engineering and the life science to the social science and professional field with its peak in the base his study the length of dissertation accept in by median number of page extend from the physical science page and life science page by way of engineering page and the professional field page to the social science page and the humanities page
there be of course many local variation
the often mammoth dissertation in history and political science more than page be balance by short one in sociology and economics to produce a average in the social science that be slightly below the average in the humanities
concern about these problem have become so widespread that the council of graduate school in appoint a task force to study the role and nature of the doctoral dissertation
""
bulk have not always be a prerequisite in humanities dissertation
when james morris whiton qualify for one of the first three yale phd
s in he submit a sixpage handwritten thesis in latin on that might strike today s abd be as sadly prophetic
the young philosopher that james cite write his dissertation in only a few week although he need another year to pad it out with scholarly apparatus
by don cameron allen in a study on the phd
in english and american literature estimate that percent of the dissertation in the field come to between and page another percent range from to page and percent amount to page or more
what be go on here
james and babbitt be both right
the phd as it be import into the united state from germany during the heyday of positivism be neither a teaching certificate as james point out nor a cachet of culture as babbitt stress
it be essentially a badge of research competence in the science introduce into this country by president who be germantrained scientist and monitor for the past century by graduateschool dean who have come preponderantly from field fiftyeight dean currently represent their institution in the association of graduate school be scientist or engineer at many university moreover the dean of the graduate school serve concurrently as dean or vicepresident or director of research
for this reason the worry about the degree have come principally from the humanist not from the scientist and engineer who have be generally quite content
berelson report that percent of physicist and percent of mathematician describe the current state of their discipline as very satisfactory as opposed to percent in history and percent in english
the level of satisfaction be low percent in the field with the long average dissertation political science

why should this be so scientist and engineer generally have a keen sense of the state of the art a consensus regarding the problem that need to be address at any given time
moreover they have be resourceful over the year in adapt the requirement of the phd
to the need and graduate student rapidly become affiliated with a group or a laboratory work on a specific problem the dissertation emerge from or as a component of the group s work
the professor often have a personal stake in seeing that piece of the project do competently and expeditiously otherwise it could delay or jeopardize the entire project
what most dissertation of this sort constitute to be sure be not a original piece of research but rather and perhaps more important a contribution to knowledge certify the ability to carry out research according to the current standard of the discipline
accordingly the dissertation be increasingly no long a monograph in the traditional sense of the word but a presentation according to the publication practice in the field it often include material already present at conference and publish by the candidate and his or her research group
the phd
thus earn do not attest the pedagogical ability or the cultural sophistication or the emotional maturity of the candidate but it do and productively in research group on other campus or in nonacademic laboratory
some social scientist and most humanist bring quite different expectation to the degree
many regard graduate school not simply as the place to acquire a certain level of knowledge and proficiency in a field but as a openended status where the aspiring phd
can sit and mellow like a wine ripen like a cheese and grow like a vegetable the organic metaphor flourish in the prose of department seek more time and support for their student
these expectation be explicit in irving babbitt s opposition of germanic specialization to the more humane growth as a man
but they be still all too often implicit today in the expectation of department interview candidate for their position
how often be the gifted scholar who have work hard to complete the degree in a reasonably short time pass over for the more mature candidate who have acquire year four hundred page in the science new phd
s be expect to mature in the postdoctoral position that have there become the norm
but in the humanities and some of the social science this process of maturation be increasingly calculate into the degree expectation
they not only want squid they want mature squid whose plumpness have be induce by hormone the correlation between timetodegree and dissertation length make the skeptical dean sometimes suspect that the dissertation be long because the ripening time need to be fill out and not viceversa
to look at it another way american humanist and social scientist be increasingly make the same demand upon the phd
that be fulfil in germany by the postdoctoral habilitationsschrift or in france by the these detat that is a major piece of postdoctoral research carry out by a candidate who be already employ as a teacher
instead of regard the degree as the beginning of a career as the certification that the degree holder be now ready to enter the first level many college and university choose to regard it as proof that the wellripened recipient have dutifully churn out four hundred page of carefully document though often dull prose publish several forgettable paper and teach the same elementary course many time over
these wellcured phd
s in turn place a burden on the system by occupy the place and the support that might otherwise be give to new candidate
if university do not succeed in get them through the system more quickly then they shall surely be unable to meet the demand of the nineties
what can be do in the first place as james suggest as early as university might low their fantastic standard by scale the phd
in the humanities and social science back to what it be originally intend to be and what it still be in many of the science and in engineering not a habilitation but simply as james put it a diploma certify mastery and mark a barrier successfully in the preliminary phase as in the dissertation
but here much could be improve
professor should discourage student from undertake topic that be not reasonable in scope
the student who boast in the new york time of august that he have spend eight year merely identify a thesis topic be either irresponsibly advise or a unregenerate ewiger student
departmental committee should monitor every stage of the process and make sure that the candidate understand the expectation that a reasonable topic can be manage in two or at most three year
the graduate school in turn can establish procedure that make it increasingly difficult for student to submit their dissertation if too much time have elapse
study of dissertation length and timetodegree suggest that university should impose a strict upper limit on thesis and refuse to accept those that be too long
this would teach student early in their career about the reality of publication deadline and length restriction
excessive length be sometimes a indication of course of the
length requirement might also ensure that the dissertation will receive a more conscientious reading than be now often the case when lengthy tome be return to the student without a mark on their page and with the most cursory of reader s report
all the study have show that few factor affect rapid completion of the phd
as powerfully as a close and encouraging relationship between student and adviser a relationship that thrive much less easily in the lonely library discipline than in the more convivial laboratory science
the dissertation must continue to be the center of doctoral education
for many phd
s it will remain the single extended piece of research and write they will ever do
even if the dissertation have not make a contribution to knowledge it have make a contribution to the candidate s own knowledge it should have teach him or her to identify and analyze a reasonable problem in the field to treat it according to accepted procedure and to present it in a accessible a exercise should prepare the new phd
to organize his or her first college course and to appreciate what it take to write a good book
a valuable byproduct of this change might be the disappearance of the vanity press and the series that exist simply to publish with a heavy subsidy and at expensive price the poorly edit and usually critically ignore dissertation currently be churn out by the system
""
the humanities might also emulate the science and such social science as economics in their tendency to accommodate the thesis to the current practice of the field
this be not to suggest approval of the practice in some field of accept as dissertation work that amount to published article bind or staple together
at many institution the locally approved manual of style have become so dominant and so tyrannically enforce that the candidate come away with the notion that style matter more than substance
a dissertation should present research result in the format appropriate to the discipline
why should a student spend hour many a new phd
revise a dissertation for publication have discover that the first thing that must go be the introductory survey of research the lengthy footnote and the cumbersome bibliographical apparatus often require for the dissertation
it would be far more helpful to the student s career as a scholar to learn the style use most widely in journal of the field to practice the art of selective quotation and to recite the credo of scholarly ethics
the dissertation should demonstrate the student s command of the basic skill of the discipline
whether or not the phd
then go on to use those skill be another matter altogether one that depend on personal energy ambition and a variety of other factor
the degree should be award like the doctorate bestow upon that promising but lazy student in seventeenthcentury avignon recall by jacob viner sub spe futuri studii
none of these change can take place until the hiring department modify what literary critic call their horizon of expectation and here the entire weight drag heavily on the present
if the expectation do not change the system will produce more and more abd s and a inadequate number of phd
s for the future
department should be seek neither the scholar who have ripen long enough in graduate school to have compile a fivehundredpage and therefore probably poorly supervise dissertation nor the scholar who have mature long enough to have acquire year of teaching or research experience and therefore probably a corresponding sense of bitterness at have be exploit by the graduate institution
department should instead be happy to appoint welltrained young phd
s who have demonstrate their commitment by move expeditiously through a reasonable program to a degree that certify their competence to begin a career in teaching and scholarship
let the hiring department participate in the continuing education of new phd
s as be the case in many of the science by supervise their development as teacher and scholar
if that happen phd
shortage in the s in the and engineering the problem be different they be not timetodegree or even attrition but rather recruitment into graduate program of us citizen adequately motivate and prepare in mathematics and basic science
but that be a problem that reach back beyond the graduate school into college secondary school and society itself
indeed the educational deficiency of american student have emerge as a national scandal that tea concerned blueribbon panel and catch the editorial attention of the national journal
why should one care about issue that might seem to be the proper and rather specialized concern of the graduate school first more than half of our phd
s be no long remain in the academic cycle but be go into government industry and other sector of our society
the worldwide need for specialist qualify to the level of phd
be go to increase in the coming decade
in a certain sense our national future depend on the graduate school
but it be also in the urgent interest of the nation at large to excellence in every field from assyriology to astrophysics and train them within a reasonable time to assume a appropriate place in a college or university
if university continue to permit or require student to spend ever long portion of the most productive period of their life in graduate school then the student enter graduate school this year will not yet be finish by the time of the excess demand predict for the year 
education can follow either a exhilarating trajectory or a vicious circle
if we do not have the best student with the fine mind in our university the institution itself can rapidly decline as it do in the seventeenth and eighteenth century when the bright thinker prefer to be associate with academy that is the counterpart of today s nonteaching research institute rather than with the university
the principle of gravity and gresham s law both provide analogy for intellectual history
water seek the low level bad money drive out the good secondrate scholar do nt like competition either among not succeed in attract excellent student into graduate program in the science and engineering and see them through to the phd
within a reasonable time in the humanities and social science undergraduate in the nineties and the first decade of the new millennium will be teach in a dizzying downward spiral by second and thirdrate phd

by theodore ziolkowski
theodore ziolkowski professor of comparative lieterature and dean of the graduate school at princeton university be the author of among other book fictional transfigurations of jesus variety of literary thematics and german romanticism and its institution
i must begin by say this in preparation for this lecture i read or in some case reread a number of the writing of sidney hook
i read them solely to give me the right starting point for a lecture give in honor of sidney hook
but instead i find myself infuse with a set of idea that be relevant to a different setting a different occasion
sidney hook give the jefferson lecture in which be publish in under the tide the paradox of freedom
he also write a introduction to a mentor book of thomas paine s writings he write many other thing as well
but as i read these two piece it suddenly become apparent to me how relevant sidney hook s idea be not only to this convention s activity but also to a question different fromthough relate to those we examine here today
next week i will participate in a meeting in warsaw a meeting attend by a select set of member of constitutional reform
the question they will be raise be question that confront any new nation question that confront jefferson and paine how do we construct a new constitution what should the constitution look like
it be with these question in the back of my mind certainly not in the front that i read sidney hook s writing about paine about jefferson and about liberty
i plan to carry his idea with me to warsaw next week
two year ago i receive a award from the sociology of education section of the american sociological association
i take the occasion to remind the sociologist present that the person to whom they be make the award have early be harass vilify and attack by officer of the association as well as by other social scientist for precisely the same research that be now the cause of a award 
i use the incident surround that research to suggest that among the threat to academic freedom the threat pose by fellow faculty member be probably administrator of university
i argue that the greatest enemy of academic freedom in the university be the norm that exist about what kind of question may be raise in research and in teach as well although that be not my topic of interest and what kind of question may not be raise
there be taboo on certain topic taboo which if broken lead to sanction not primarily from administrator or the general public but from one s own colleague
it be not always so
the research and writing of professor be once far more subject to the norm of the large community than they be today
at the university of chicago for example a distinguished sociologist w i thomas be spy upon harass and finally drive out of the university by a newspaper whose publisher regard thomas s research on prostitution to be a violation of community more
""
the taboo that a sociologist be most likely to encounter be those concern question of difference between gender or difference between race the social factor lead to homosexuality that begin with the premise that homosexuality be less natural than heterosexuality would be under a similar taboo
and there be other topic with taboo less strong
what interest and concern me be the defining characteristic of these taboo and how they be hold in place
for it be these taboo on the raising of certain question the gentleman s agreement that certain question remain unexamined that constitute one major threat to academic freedom in university and college
what be more it be a threat that operate not merely through pressure from colleague but also through selfsuppression
it be this phenomenon of selfsuppression that i want to focus on today
i will do so by recount a incident one i have long put out of mind until i be remind of it recently by a research proposal of one of my student a hispanic student of the sociology of education
in the proposal a welldesigned study of the interaction between elementary school student and teacher my student point the proportion of minority student and the proportion of minority teacher
the student raise the question often raise concerning black student with white teacher but here concerning hispanic student with nonhispanic teacher of whether the cultural difference might contribute to the educational disadvantage experience by hispanic student in american school
this be a reasonable question but it remind me of another i once fail to ask in research on inequality
of educational opportunity
the occasion be this in under a provision of the civil right act of the united state office of education as it be then call be carry out a survey of the lack of equality of education by race and i be direct the study on parttime loan from john hopkins university
the research arrive at some result we have not expect of which three be most important
first we discover that the facility and resource of school attend by black and white child in the same region and urbanrural setting differ very little the principal setting not between race within these setting
this do lead to inequality of resource and facility by race but only through their different distribution across the country
second we find that even if the resource distribution have be different it would not have matter very much differential effectiveness of different school be not closely relate to the resource put into the school by school board nor to per pupil expenditure age of textbook or a host of other measure of presumed school quality
to understand how this second result could be so how the output of education could be unrelated to the school input it be only necessary to shift the context
in the industry of eastern europe and the soviet union which like american public school operate under state management free from the market discipline create by consumer choice output also have very little relation to input
in such system the force that would bring this about be largely miss
on the other hand there be one student achievement than others
teacher be give a short vocabulary test in the survey and we find that the teacher score on vocabulary test be relate to the verbal achievement of student in the school
other characteristic of teacher be not including degree experience and salary but vocabulary test score be relate
the third result of the research be that black child achieve more highly in school with student body that be predominantly middleclass
although the official school resource matter little for their achievement the resource provide by what fellow student bring to school do make a difference not as much as their own family background but more than the school board s resource
these result have various consequence
the first two be strongly oppose within the department of health education and welfare for they go against conventional wisdom as well as the recentlyinitiated federal policy of funding school physical facility
the third result be use by plaintiff in school desegregation case including the citywide busing case that be one result about which little be say
it be the result to which i now want to return the relation of teacher vocabulary score to student achievement
one of the policy issue that be current at the time a necessary accompaniment of school desegregation be the future of black teacher as the formerly segregated school system of the south be dismantle
these teacher be at a disadvantage because of the strong prejudice hold by many southern white against have their child teach by black teacher
but they be also at another disadvantage themselves product of segregated school system they be on the whole less prepared and qualified with low verbal skill than their white counterpart
what do this mean for the research the question we do not ask be one directly connect to our research find that child s verbal achievement in school be relate to the vocabulary test score of the teacher in the school
this finding take together with the fact that black teacher be generally not as wellprepared as white teacher lead of the fate of black teacher from formerly segregated school system how be the achievement of black child relate to the racial composition of the teaching staff in the school
these two fact would also lead to the conjecture that black child would be do less well on average under black teacher than under white teacher
in contrast the rolemodeling or cultural difference hypothesis that be implicit in my hispanic student s research proposal would lead to the opposite conjecture that they would be do better on average under black teacher
but if the first conjecture be right it would have some disturbing implication
one would be that a major source of inequality of educational opportunity for black student be the fact that they be be teach by black teacher
another directly relevant to the policy issue would be that both black and white child would have great educational opportunity if they be not teach by these teacher
it be this potential implication i suggest that be the cause of our not have find
perhaps it be not this
we have many other thing to keep us busy many other bartles to fight with agency official who do not like our result many problem in merely maintain the integrity of the research report in the face of attempt to rewrite or to undermine it altogether
yet i believe that a dispassionate researcher concerned with find fact relevant to the policy issue at hand one of which be school staff desegregation would have go on to pose the question we do not ask
one could well argue that by not ask it we aid in the sacrifice of educational opportunity for many child most of whom be black to protect the career of black teacher
and one could argue that by not ask it we encourage the continued neglect of the kind of skillspecific retraining program not only for black teacher but for all teacher that might have bring improvement in educational outcome
but my principal concern here be not this policy issue
it of a research question the impulse not to ask the crucial question a impulse if i be correct that prevent many relevant research question from be raise
these question be not generally of the kind that be clearly taboo among university researcher yet they be nonetheless subject to more subtle pressure lead to the selfsuppression of research
how do these subtle pressure arise i believe it can be put this way
we hesitate to ask research question which might lead to result that would elicit disapproval by those colleague we see regularly
we monitor our own activity and suppress those that do not meet this criteria
when there be a strong consensus among these colleague we redirect our behavior accordingly
the stake be not trivial
i think of a sociologist who during the fervor of the s ask the wrong question and come out with answer inimical to the school desegregation policy favor by his fellow sociologist and subsequently fail to get tenure
i know also from personal experience on similar the kind of result that most strongly elicit disapproval by one s colleague in university the answer be not always and everywhere the same but i believe that for many academic in many setting the following can be say there be certain policy certain public activity that have the property that they stem from benevolent intention express toward those less fortunate or in some way oppress
the intended consequence follow transparently from the policy
these be policy design to aid the poor or to aid black or hispanic or woman and any result that would hinder one of these policy be subject to disapproval and attack
these be policy intend to display egalitarian intention
for many academic they replace the pattern of conspicuous consumption that thorsten veblen attribute to the rich
they might be call policy of conspicuous benevolence
they display conspicuously the benevolent intention of their supporter
the consensus about such policy among academic stem if i be not mistake from a general view that there be a single broad good intention who want to help the disadvantaged and those who be selfish and oppose to any aid to those less fortunate
this view manifest itself in a thousand way
it be the source of widespread support for communism among intellectual in the s and s
it be the source of widespread support for sanction against south africa today for civil right measure for school buse policy for generous welfare provision for bill to aid the handicapped for the equal right amendment
sometimes the support be wellplaced
sometimes it be not
the conflict between this conspicuous benevolence and dispassionate research on the consequence of social policy lie in the difference between intention and consequence
a former teacher of mine robert k merton have point out that because the indirect consequence of social action may be very different from its intended consequence much of sociology consist of examine the unintended consequence of purposive action the policy of conspicuous benevolence be not unfortunately immune to this principle that intention do not equal be intend to help
but so long as there be a consensus among academic on the policy of conspicuous benevolence selfsuppression will prevent their serious questioning
how may that consensus be oppose or undo the problem be a fundamental one because a university be a community and a department be a community within that community
it be within such community that norm grow and thrive
a norm about what be the correct thing to teach and what be the correct research to carry out constitute a assumption by the community of the right to disapprove or otherwise sanction a member on the basis of his research or teaching
member of that community feel a obligation one that sometimes lead to the selfsuppression i have describe early to accede to such community right
in a different context sidney hook write about this recognize the close connection between community and right accompany by obligation
in the first of his lecture publish as the paradox of freedom he say
obligation be purpose needsome shared interest want or feel require the functioning presence of these right
without some common nature or some community of feeling the sense of obligation could hardly develop the assertion of right would have no binding or driving emotional force 
as sidney hook write community generate right right generate obligation and it be this obligation that lead in the case under question to the selfsuppression of academic freedom
yet there be a way out
there be hierarchy of shared value in a community and therefore hierarchy of right
if in the hierarchy of value hold by the academic community of which one be a part the value of freedom of inquiry be high than the value of equality the value that give rise to conspicuous benevolence then such constraint such selfsuppression of research into inconvenient question will no long be effective
it be this i submit which be lack in many university setting
if it be present the of obligation it entail would lead to the pursuit of inconvenient question without constraint
in the absence of such a hierarchy of value with freedom of inquiry above equality the most efficacious mean to insure that inconvenient question be pursue may lie in the creation of a community within the university that can insulate its member from the effect of the general pressure toward conspicuous benevolence
the creation of such a community cut across university a invisible college span the academic community as a whole may constitute another mean
in this second alternative lie the importance of the insulation provide by a association like the national association of scholar
again i be honor to be the recipient of the first sidney hook memorial award of the national association of scholar
be he here today he would be pleased with the activity that carry on his fight for academic freedom
i would like to think i be best know for my wisdom and learning but in truth such fame as i have derive from my be a reputed conservative who be also dean of yale college
that be the reason news of my appointment appear in the wall street journal and the national review which do nt usually happen to dean of yale college and do nt help them much when it do
what have i do to be consider so unusual it seem i have a very dark record at yale
back in william shockley be prevent from speak at yale after arrive at a lecture hall complete with audience
nothing like that have happen in memory and it be a pretty bad moment for us
i take it upon myself to make a public address in which i trace yale s failure over the preceding decade to protect freedom of speech
as it turn out this talk have a certain effect
it result in the appointment of a commission chair by produce a report on the importance of freedom of speech at university the recommendation of which be adopt by the yale corporation and be now part of the yale code of law
in any case during the course of that speech i make it very clear that the then president of yale be a major reason for the failure to protect freedom of speech
a short while later yale face the scandal of a brilliant teacher and outstanding scholar one of the best in his field i would say be deny tenure by his department
i find this so outrageous and so plainly the consequence of illegitimate consideration and improper procedure that i publicly denounce the action thus provoke a yale daily news headline along the line of kagan call committee s report whitewash which indeed be a correct report of my remark
that incident be also relatively unprecedented at yale
finally when a group of student erect shanty on a key part of the yale campus to protest be supposed to consider rule violation take no action against them i step forward before those structure and make a speech to object
thus when some year later the president appoint me to the position of dean of yale college all of these event be a part of my record
that provoke a certain amount of comment and i be tell that a chill of fear run through some segment of the faculty
the yale daily news seek opinion from various faculty member
one harkening back to my remark about the shanty and my complaint that the people who have violate our rule have not be punish declare that this be evidence of a frightening intolerance on my part
far since i have be and continue to be know to favor what i call common study or a core curriculum another faculty member say my appointment be very dangerous because i believe some thing be more important than others
but to get a real sense of the way my appointment news editorial entitle a unsettling choice experienced kagan have much to prove
in donald kagan president schmidt have choose as dean of yale college a respected professor and experienced administrator
he also have send what could be perceive as a dangerous message to this community
that kagan be qualify to be a dean be clear
as chairman of a committee which in recommended change in the structure of student government at yale and as act athletic director from kagan have prove administrative experience
student in kagan s classic course extol his teaching style and ability some say that no one should leave yale without have take his class
despite kagan s personal achievement his appointment as the top officer of yale college have justifiably alarm some student and faculty
kagan be a white male professor of history and classic who in the past have espouse decidedly conservative political and academic view
during the presidential search for a new dean the name of at least two woman and one emerge as likely contender for the position
given that the process engender hope much of it in these page that a progressive candidate might be name to the post kagan s appointment suggest to many in this community that schmidt plan to continue his administration s conservative course
several of kagan s professed view give cause for worry about the next five year at yale
in a letter to the news last year kagan criticize student at yale football game say they chant slogan in foul and obscene language that be hear by woman and child and family nearby some of them family of the player who be unaccustomed to contemporary student more
such a remark at best demonstrate a outdated paternalism at bad it offend proponent of free speech and equality of the sex alike
student be not the only member of this community disturb by kagan s appointment however
at a time when yale be nurture a number of innovative academic department specifically those in area kagan s devotion to the traditional liberal art canon could impede far curricular progress and experimentation
in light of the probable pessimism with which many in this community will greet kagan s appointment the new dean must act quickly and decisively to prove his detractor wrong
after four year of a dean perceive by most undergraduate as unresponsive to their concern and uninterested in discuss their point of view kagan s most pressing and difficult task will be to restore student faith in the position
he should take several measure to do so
over the next few week kagan should call a wide range of student to his office simply to talk with them
not only will such meeting give the dean insight into student attitude but they will assure student that the new dean be truly interested in actively solicit their opinion
periodic attendance at yale college council the student government meeting also would allow kagan to learn firsthand of the issue most concern student
over the year kagan have he must demonstrate as forcefully that he can accommodate the interest of a diverse and for now worried community 
well i do nt do what be suggest needless to say
but it be evident how problematic my appointment be
now what i find terribly worrisome be not the notion of everyone tremble at the appointment of a character like me which be really very funny but that it be consider acceptable to suggest there be something inherently alarming or worrisome about appoint a white male historian and classicist who have be know to utter conservative view about politics and academic matter
just think what would happen if somebody have write the same thing about a black female professor who have be know to utter liberal view on these issue
i can just imagine the outrage and the claim of censorship
but the insinuation of this editorial be regard as perfectly acceptable
i happen to know the kid who write it
he be very nice and have no another student write a letter in response point out how outrageous it really be
all this tell us something about what a strange situation we live in
what then can one conclude about my future prospect as dean i do nt know yet but at least i can report that a year have go by and i be still in office
i be not sure that be go to happen
of course i will nt predict how long i will remain because i can nt say what will turn out to be possible
on the other hand i should say that it have nt be a bad time i have about as much hair as last year and it be not any grayer it can nt be
moreover i think i have have a few small achievement and maybe there be some hope in that
however let me now address some of the question that concern not just me but all of us and see if what i clue for reform
first let us consider the question of the curriculum
yale have no common core of study
i have on many occasion complain about this and explain the nature of the deficiency cause by the absence of such a program a fact which more than anything else have terrify people
i have say it before i be say it now and i will say it again in the future i have no intention of try to introduce such a program at yale
it would be one of the most foolish thing i could do
for one reason there be not the small chance the faculty would approve it as a general requirement but that be the least serious problem
it would be far more terrible if the faculty do approve it
consider what a core construct by the current faculty would look like and the consequence that would ensue if they also have the responsibility of teach it
at a research university such as yale the faculty have be train to they be very uncomfortable in reach out the way teacher of the liberal art have traditionally be ask to do
so i have no such plan to force a formal core curriculum on the college as a whole
however the idea of have interest faculty member voluntarily put together a set of course that cover certain core text be something else
nobody could stop us from do that and i think we could probably do more good that way than by fight a losing battle for a formal core
unfortunately i think the number of people who might involve themselves in such a effort would be small
second as to the question of discrimination we must begin by recognize that it be a critical one and very properly relate to the question of excellence
it be possible at yale i believe to make the case for excellence and one of the reason i accept my highly problematic assignment be that i wish to create a great degree of freedom of expression on precisely this subject
the same thing i always have be say but say them as dean of yale college and if i survive that experience for any period of time it would make it easy for others to do the same
so i have continue to say these thing and while people be nt necessarily persuade by them they do pay more attention than they use to
what be more my sense be that these idea do now seem to be less outrageous
but again that be only a preliminary report
i be much attract by the notion of talk about the specific thing that can be do to make a difference and i have a strategic suggestion which i think might be very important
one of the thing i have try to do in the short time i have be dean be to support foster and extend the study of the natural science at yale
now heaven know simply for balance yale need that more than most place because we be so topheavy in that
in my judgment the natural science be the healthy of the discipline teach at our university
i do nt know a single natural scientist who do not believe in the efficacy of reason or the possibility of truth arrive at through reason
on the other hand the wood be full of humanist who doubt those thing
therefore increase the number and percentage of your faculty who believe in reason and truth be inherently a good thing
secondly support and allow them to feel they be a important maybe the most important part of your operation be also good
the one other thing that you must do however be to make them understand the issue that they normally ignore those that shape the part of the university they tend to regard with distant amusement
after all people in the humanities do nt experiment do nt have control disagree about what be good and bad and overall seem a very funny bunch of guy
so you have to humanities and why it matter to them enormously
what be more you have to involve them in the total life of the institution and ask their help in defend reason and the search for truth
and if you do my experience be that they will respond
and boy do we need em
we really do
and this be true quite apart from the intrinsic value of increase the understanding knowledge and practice of science in the world today
consequently as a strategic suggestion i would urge you to reach out to your scientific colleague and ask them to help in the common cause
you will find that they will be especially good in the area that i regard as central the main weapon that we have in this fight our insistence on high standard of intellectual achievement
such a insistence be something scientist understand automatically it do nt have to be explain to them in any way
and that be where you can hold the line
at of underlying support for high achievement particularly among the student
one of the happy experience i have have this year have be to participate in bestow some of the traditional prize give out to student at commencement time
yale be wonderfully oldfashioned and many of these prize probably go back to the eighteenth century
for example they give a prize for the student with the high standing objectively arrive at in each of the division
and there be also a prize for the student who be think to be somehow the very best a more subjective judgment but also base on all kind of objective data
now as dean of yale college i make those award this year and it be wonderful the way the class receive them warmly enthusiastically encouragingly with not the slight embarrassment at this single out of people even within a already elite oligarchic group for great elitism than ordinary
it be really a beautiful sight
and it tell you that if you can take the sting its remarkable desirable condition people will respond very positively
what seem so often true be that the thing we deplore that seem to us so injurious to the quality and functioning of our institution be in fact thing that degrade or detract from excellence
but it be also important to note that the people do the most damage at our institution rarely say yeah we do nt care about excellence
we want to get equality
we do nt care if they be excellent or not
what they say instead be we be for equality and we be for excellence
and so you have a weapon because there be obviously some contradiction there
the best way of hold to excellence be to be very careful and selective in the people you bring forward into position of leadership
if in make these selection you choose faculty member who be themselves excellent and appreciate and insist on excellence you will discover that amazing thing can happen
for example which have nt be apply for a very long time can again be enforce and that people will respond to them not always positively and often with some mutter about where they will be next year but nonetheless with genuine acceptance
finally with respect to the question of diversity we should reflect on the fact that while it present a very serious problem it be one quite different from that typically imagine
we be all familiar with the demand for diversity of representation one from each color and continent and so on but what about the diversity of idea to me this seem to be the most dreadful problem we face today
i think that most people who teach subject in which idea be central
as opposed to knowledge and technique be stunningly similar to one another
the degree of difference of opinion on my faculty be so slight as to be very troubling
when i begin teaching the common wisdom be that our student have in outlook
that be a wonderful thing because it forced student to test their inherited idea against our challenge
the result be conflict confusion turmoil and think out of which could come either strengthen belief in inherited value or a change of mind base on better argument or better belief
when i look at the university today however i see that the situation have change sharply
the student come to yale mainly with what might be describe vaguely as liberal belief
i hate to use that word because it be not true
liberal ought to have something to do with liberty and what be generally call liberal these day have very litre to do with that
but you understand the code that i be use
and we on the faculty for the most part hold even more liberal belief than our student
accordingly the result be not conflict but mutual massage of a imperfect and unprofessional kind
now that be not education need to have great difference of opinion
it be not necessary of course that the faculty and student body be completely at odds with one another or that there be some particular ratio of dissent
in fact only five or ten outstanding teacher on a faculty of five hundred can be enough to provide the required challenge if they be good and in the right subject
that be my experience when i be a young assistant professor at cornell
there be perhaps five or ten such people and the result be astonishing
i take it for grant because it be my first real position
later on i discover it be extraordinary and very nearly impossible to find today
now be there anything that can be do about this my own experience be that very few case exist in which there be active discrimination against people who have let us say conservative view
it almost never get to that
what happen instead be that the number of people with such view for the best position be terribly small
hence in look for intellectual diversity you find yourself in a position where you can nt beat somebody with nobody
i can tell you that at yale we have be look closely and carefully at departmental search to ensure that no discrimination go on but by itself this give little prospect of solve the problem
so what we have be a deepseated difficulty that be go to be very hard to overcome

when allan bloom write the closing of the american mind he be probably not think of the closed mind under the image of a contraceptive
still less would anyone be likely to think of the open mind that way
but such be precisely the image that seem to govern a series of event at princeton university this past year which culminate in the dismissal of one of the official catholic chaplains 
c john mccloskey be a young priest who belong to opus dei the work of god a mixed layclerical organization found in spain in the s with branch throughout the catholic world
opus dei pride itself on its loyalty to the pope and its rigorous spiritual discipline
some of its member be active in the franco government in spain and the group have often be accuse of have a conservative political ideology
officially opus dei state that it have no political position as such but that its member be free to engage in political activity opus dei member be know to be politically active
the group have for year be in the habit of establish house near elite university and seem to recruit new member primarily from such environment
there be degree of affiliation some of which be relatively loose
the group be active at princeton as early as and in it purchase a house just off campus to serve as its local headquarters
the purchase alarm some princetonians indicate as it do that the organization intend to become a permanent presence at the university
almost from the beginning rumor about the group and its alleged hidden agenda be circulate in both catholic and noncatholic circle in the community
among liberal catholic opus dei have a image somewhat like that of the mason in early time a malign secret organization with control tentacle move in all direction
little of this have ever be document and whatever the group may do in other part of the world it be clear that in the united state personal piety
from to the official catholic chaplain at princeton be father charles weiser a trenton diocesan priest who direct the aquinas foundation
this organization be princeton s equivalent of the newman club elsewhere and have its headquarters in a house once occupy by thomas mann
weiser be appoint by the bishop of trenton and be officially recognize by the university
by his own account weiser be at first cool to opus dei and he describe his early encounter with mccloskey as less than friendly
eventually however he make the decision to appoint mccloskey a assistant director of the aquinas foundation as much as anything according to weiser to keep a eye on him
""
shortly afterwards weiser terminate official relation with another assistant chaplain jesuit father robert ferrick because of disagreement over aquinas foundation policy
rather than accept weiser s policy ferrick leave princeton but his departure cause a good deal of bitterness among his campus admirer
run through the dispute over opus and it be reveal that ferrick s most ardent admirer who attend a weekly midnight mass he celebrate refer to themselves as the druid
one of them the leftwing journalist gloria emerson note something remarkable must have be go on to get a jewish undergraduate a puerto rican methodist sic and a agnostic together for a catholic worship service
 ferrick himself in his farewell message list his constituency as druid chapel colleague black and latino friend those concerned with alcohol and drug abuse the harassed the marginal the foreigner
 notably absent from the list be those he have be appoint primarily to serve traditional catholic
ferrick s departure be the occasion for the first public attack on opus dei attack notable for the fact that in one of the major scholarly community in the united state they be make without any feel need to offer proof not even to define term
thus walter murphy a catholic say opus dei have fascist tie
 the closest opus dei s critic ever come to offer proof of their charge of a malign hidden agenda be a frequent citing of the book the people of god the struggle for world catholicism viking by the late leftwing journalist penny lernoux which claim that opus dei have be involved in various rightwing movement in latin america
lernoux be hardly a disinterested scholar and opus dei official point out that the organization have win a libel suit against her in a west german court
her book however be cite over and over again as irrefutable evidence of opus dei s sinister nature
this alarm be fuel within a community that pride itself on openness and rationality by almost unlimited attention in both the campus and the community press to all the group s critic frequently cite the same people say the same thing over and over again
for a while no mention of opus dei in princeton fail to recall that the woman find murder in the basement despite the fact that this information have absolutely no bearing on the controversy
for some month before the mccloskey case come to a boil the press relate how some princeton catholic be worry about the organization and its possible intention call it cultlike and possess a rightwing reputation
 murphy allege that opus dei have particularly target ivy league university a charge which if true merely prove that it accept those institution own evaluation of their worth
weiser initially unsympathetic to opus dei observe with some irony the behavior of highly rational academic
the guy mccloskey be come down here three time a week and people be paralyze by anxiety
the immediate feeling i have be that they be act like a elephant jump on a chair try to get away from a mouse
people be afraid opus dei be go to take over 
critic of mccloskey studiously avoid one inconvenient fact student and others and it be by no means clear that his critic outnumber his supporter
the critic claim with considerable vehemence that mccloskey s approach to religion be inherently offensive and oppressive and in case that fact be not know widely enough give it maximum publicity
but if that be so it seem to follow that in a highly sophisticated community like princeton mccloskey s approach would have little success and he would in time be force to withdraw
what really bother his critic which for obvious reason they could not admit be that intelligent people including undergraduate do find his message attractive
the critic task then be to save such people from themselves
the most vocal critic be a undergraduate name robert taliercio a member of the leftwing religious group pax christi the peace of christ who be one of those constantly refer to opus dei be suppose rightwing political tie
taliercio claim to have attend a opus dei program in spain one summer member live in very luxurious surroundings if live in opulence be ground for condemnation it might be suppose that many princeton student themselves would have to be damn
however for all the talk about rightwing political ideology no princeton critic of opus dei ever report any direct experience of this
no one claim that mccloskey try to influence his political view or to recruit him into any kind of political activity even on such identifiably catholic issue as abortion
instead a small number of student report that they have be offend by mccloskey s approach to what the catholic church call spirituality or personal religious discipline
some undergraduate no more than a half dozen be ever identify complain that he be overly negative rigid and censorious which turn out to mean that he place a good deal of emphasis on personal sin warn student to avoid certain occasion of sin and suggest that the large world merely classical christian doctrine once teach at princeton and other protestant school and if it be indeed unattractive to modern american the problem again would have be selfcorrecting mccloskey would simply have fail in his mission
thus critic be force once more to avoid the central issue that in a truly pluralistic environment catholic be free to accept or reject mccloskey s advice as they see fit
instead they have to go through remarkable contortion to conceal the fact that they simply want church and university authority to suppress a individual whose view they find personally distasteful
some attempt be make to imply that mccloskey have engage in improper action such as a female student s claim that he question her in the confessional about her sexual activities allegedly these impropriety have be report to university authority
the nadir of yellow journalism in the case be reach by the trenton time which report that evidence of these action have be give to university source who prefer to remain anonymous action against them
 the time thus find it possible to insinuate serious impropriety on mccloskey s part to offer no proof to claim that the evidence exist but be be suppress and to charge that the university have be intimidate by opus dei
if the university do indeed keep the complaint confidential for fear of legal action a logical assumption might be that the complaint be unfounded and would not withstand scrutiny
""
unable to state frankly that they seek to suppress mccloskey s opinion simply because they find them offensive his critic next fall back on a relatively narrow point that he should not be allow to represent the aquinas foundation since it would officially associate the catholic church with his own allegedly distorted theology
but it be the prerogative of the foundation s director and ultimately of the bishop of trenton to decide who could enjoy official status in the chaplaincy
weiser later state that he have investigate every complaint against mccloskey and find no impropriety even though he do
the logic of the critic position be that no one who could be view as controversial ought to be give official status by the foundation a contention they would hardly have defend under other circumstance father ferrick have also be highly controversial
a priest who for example might have offend some people by passionately support the sandinista in nicaragua would in all likelihood be dub a prophet and praise for his courage
the nub of the issue be halfconsciously express by taliercio when he accuse opus dei of try to stamp out those who do not agree
 but mccloskey be not demand the expulsion from the aquinas foundation of those who do not support his view rather the reverse be the case
in effect his critic position be opus dei want to suppress disagreement so we have to suppress it first
it be the dilemma of modern liberalism in a nutshell be tolerant pluralism either tolerant or pluralistic enough to tolerate those to tolerate only those whose view be like its own
taliercio say that he have originally be attract to opus dei because it provide security and it make complicated life very simple
everything be black and white
you do nt have to think
 it be a curious confession for a ivy league student to make prompt as it do the obvious question if you be so easily manipulate then how do you know that you be really thinking right now but it be also necessary to justify the exercise in liberal censorship those who accept the opus dei position allegedly do not do so with full freedom and understanding and must be protect by those who know better
in december suzi landolphi a professional comedienne perform a routine at princeton design to promote both safe sex and feminism which include such thing as pull a male student in front of a video camera order him to say vaginal it get catch in your throat
she also have female student stretch condom over male student head as a mean of desensitize the audience to contraceptive
mccloskey subsequently publish a letter in the daily princetonian the official campus newspaper object that landolphi view student as salivate animal without any capacity for selfcontrol
 one student respond in a letter by accuse mccloskey of try once more to enslave woman with the holy bond of matrimony and of keep them barefoot pregnant and in the kitchen a illogical charge give the fact that mccloskey be preach chastity
the student conclude by suggest that perhaps the princeton community
and society at large should advise mccloskey to take to drink nothing but the semen of aids patient
""
early mccloskey s critic have meet with the new director of the aquinas foundation a trenton diocesan priest name vincent keane to demand mccloskey s removal
keane who remain publicly noncommital let it be know for use the foundation s name in his letter
follow the semen letter it might have be think that at least some of mccloskey s critic would begin to wonder whether the tone of the debate be sink low than be proper for a elite university but there be no evidence that they be embarrassed by such rhetoric
in some way the essence of the matter be state by another student letterwriter who explicitly deny that opus dei be entitle to the toleration of a pluralistic open society on the ground that their agenda be to establish a universal hegemonic view
the writer conclude
in a plural liberal democracy mccloskey be allow to spread his aids assault on inquiry discourse and speech
but we have our contraceptive open mind
 the landolphi incident reveal most clearly that the real opposition to opus dei therefore be not over its alleged rightwing political tie but over sexual liberation and mccloskey be because he dare to disagree publicly with current conventional wisdom
intellectual freedom be explicitly describe as a contraceptive the purpose of which be to exclude consideration of unfashionable view
that sexual orthodoxy be the root of the tension between mccloskey and some in the princeton community be confirm when the g k chesterton society sponsor a talk by maggie gallagher the author of a book argue that woman have be exploit by the sexual revolution
gallagher face a partially hostile audience which at one point pelt the stage with condom
a feminist student publish a review of the speech which stop just short of say that gallagher should have be bar from campus argue that she appear under false pretense since she fail to acknowledge that she support patriarchy the chesterton society be then accuse of be a opus dei front organization found to give the group unmerited intellectual respectability although member point out that only some of them be affiliate with opus dei
mccloskey s defender soon find themselves in a forth yet another barrage of attack which widen to include not only mccloskey but any student who dare to defend him
the technique be classic mccarthyism ceaselessly repeat charge offer without proof unsubstantiated claim often by unnamed people hint about confidential evidence which be be suppress
opus dei find itself in the impossible situation of have to say in effect over and over again we be not a cult
""
mccloskey s critic repeatedly criticize the aquinas foundation and the university for not investigate their charge
but luis tellez head of opus dei s princeton house point out that no one have ever file a formal complaint against mccloskey with the university authority which would have result in a investigation in which mccloskey could have defend himself
the critic weapon be primarily a unceasing propaganda barrage and they seem to have calculate correctly as it turn out that such a assault would eventually achieve their goal without the obligation of have to prove their charge in any rigorous concerning matter of sexual behavior the critic begin claim that he have warn student against take particular course and prohibit them from read particular book and that opus dei member themselves be forbid to read certain works
they therefore assert that mccloskey s approach to education be fundamentally at odds with the nature of the university
mccloskey in turn claim that the allegation be untrue or highly distort
the only smoking gun the critic could find which they attempt to establish as the murder weapon be a memo from the priest list about forty course of possible interest from a christian culture viewpoint at princeton university
 the list be draw directly from the university catalogue and include nine academic department its net cast wide enough to include both the religion of islam and the origin of modern science
criticism center on a note append to the list remember everything depend on the outlook of the teacher give the course
the latter may seem quite interesting and stimulating impact be counterproductive
this warning critic trumpet be censorship of the bad kind and in violation of the very nature of free inquiry
but no critic even allege that mccloskey s list omit course that should have be include which would have be the obvious way of censor course the priest think unacceptable and on the face of it the list be a recommendation not a condemnation
mccloskey give no indication which course if any he consider antichristian and his warning be no different from the kind feminist and militant ethnic minority issue all the time on university campus
thus critic be in the position to assert that mccloskey have no right to evaluate university course no matter how mildly or obliquely a curious understanding of the nature of free inquiry
at the end of last march six student circulate a open letter to the princeton community accuse mccloskey of use the tactic of intimidation and claim that his presence on campus be detrimental to the their name append to the list not all of them catholic
although mccloskey s critic portray him as fostering ignorance in contrast to those like themselves who value knowledge their publicity be consistently mar by elementary error
thus on their petition the name of the historian carl schorske be spell scherske and one student claim that mccloskey have warn her against read bertram russell
""
tellez issue a detailed response to the petition mention among other thing the libel suit against penny lernoux and the fact that no formal complaint against mccloskey have be lodge with the university he also say that certain statement attribute to mccloskey be not authentic
mccloskey s defender be at a constant disadvantage however since his critic use each defense merely as a occasion to mount the same charge even more aggressively a tactic which both the university and the community press be more than willing to permit
keane who have meet with twenty people demand mccloskey s ouster now have no right to warn student about antichristian course keane cite his own experience as a college professor of speech pathology to justify his judgment apparently a act of professional solidarity with professor for whom freedom include immunity from criticism
the daily princetonian after give mccloskey s critic maximum publicity for month now formally side with those critic in a editorial decree that the opus dei group should be allow to preserve its religious identity but only to the extent that its practice do not intrude upon the university s academic mission
 both this statement and keane be seem to imply that academic freedom include professor immunity from outside criticism
the princetonian s formula also seem to imply that opus dei s preservation of its religious identity be a privilege grant by the university
in april keane announce that mccloskey would not be return to the aquinas foundation in the fall a decision mccloskey say have be convey to him in december the time of the approximately nine hundred catholic student on campus have sign the petition against him and categorically deny their charge
the princetonian article announce his dismissal be a comedy of error which scarcely bolster the claim that mccloskey s critic represent responsible scholarship
keane appear to be advocate affirmative action for hawaiian when he be quote as say that he hope to replace mccloskey with a lei woman and the student paper identify keane s photograph as mccloskey s give rise to a deliciously wicked fantasy on the part of mccloskey s supporter that of post copy of the paper all over campus with the notation this man have be officially find to be dangerous to student
if you see him on campus detain him and call the police
""
now even the claim by mccloskey s critic that the issue be the relatively narrow one of whether he ought to be officially associate with the aquinas foundation be bely when follow the announcement of his nonrenewal they continue to press for a university air the same charge against him
keane s action in surrender to mccloskey s critic be curious in part because of their increasingly frank agenda
one student write for the princetonian accepted opus dei s claim to loyalty to the pope but assert that good catholic need pay no attention to him one leader of the antimccloskey faction who publish a lengthy attack against him sign a proabortion advertisement in the princetonian however when weiser write a letter to the newspaper argue that mccloskey have be mistreat it be not publish
the letter later appear in a conservative student publication the princeton sentinel in a summary of the case in which several of the student who sign the petition against mccloskey admit that they never meet him and have sign at the urging of their friends 
mccloskey and opus dei intend to remain active in princeton and mccloskey have say that his exclusion from the aquinas foundation might actually make his work easy
the pastor of st paul s catholic church board member of the aquinas foundation who say he be not consult about mccloskey s removal have comment it seem that a little orthodoxy scare a lot of people
 princeton university itself seem to bear little responsibility for what happen to the priest
there be no evidence that the university seek his removal although the few official who speak publicly mildly criticize mccloskey
primary responsibility rest with keane who appear to have decide simply to buy peace
even if every single charge against mccloskey be true his comment and action be within the bound of what be usually define as academic freedom
ironically in the future those in the princeton community
inclined to think that catholic official fail to respect this freedom have only to look at the treatment accord john mccloskey to find prime evidence for their thesis
section report from the academy preformatted table
alexander pope
my association with the english department at duke university begin in 
have take my bachelor s and master s degree at the university of tennessee i be look for a place to study for the doctorate and be interested in a change in academic scenery
as i consider various program duke university keep surface as a particularly attractive choice
it be small but not too small it have educate two of my best undergraduate professor its library be spectacularly fine and with its gothic architectural splendor and lush garden it be the most beautiful place i have ever see
furthermore in my english study thus far i have often find duke scholar such as allan gilbert on dante and the renaissance benjamin boyce on eighteenthcentury culture newman i white on shelley and lionel stevenson c xxr sanders and paull f baum on victorian literature particularly valuable
their work be thorough serious and solid something new and worthwhile
i enter the doctoral program at duke concentrate primarily on eighteenth and nineteenthcentury english literature and after take my phd
in move on to the university of rochester as a andrew mellon postdoctoral fellow
thus begin a career that have take me to a number of institution give me a chance to write teach and chair for perhaps too many year a english department and generally have allow me to experience the kind of up and down usually associate with a academic career
through it all i find that my training at duke serve me well
duke could not of course strike brilliance from such ordinary stuff as i but it do give me a thorough grounding in the english language and english literary history and a exposure to a very broad range of english american and world literature
it also instil in me the sense that however important the profession and my own career might be to me literature and culture be much more so and moreover quite transcend in significance the relatively small world of american academic life
after i have little contact with affair at duke
then in the fall of i receive a duke university english newsletter a publication promising to be the first in a ongoing semiannual enterprise to keep alumnus and friend of the department up to date on what be go on in the department
my first perhaps naive response be one of at least mild pleasure
learn about the goingson in one s old graduate program seem innocent enough though i do remember think that the rather slickly produce publication seem just a bit vulgar and out of key with the duke i have know
in my time selfadvertisement be view with something like disdain and we graduate student joke that the classic departmental recommendation be the onesentence statement that a given candidate be not without redeem virtue
well this chirpy little newsletter be a far cry from the whole inoffensive
it list the current departmental faculty with a paragraph about each professor s background and publication
at the end of this section however i come bolt upon the following
we hope that it be our humanness as well as our professional achievement that will come to the fore in future issue of the newsletter enough so at least to make you want to read about who and what we be what we do what we think and even what we be like when we be outside the hallowed hall of academe
perhaps i be too sensitive but this statement positively jar
just what do they mean by humanness i be certainly far from convinced that whatever it might be it could be communicate in a sixpage newsletter
suspect them of cant i think they rather expect more interest in them personally than be warrant
if i detect something selfserving and selfimportant in that statement some of my fear be a successful duke writers conference be discuss which attract national attention apparently a mention in the new york time hold rigorous workshop and create a rich environment
another item note a predictably successful association of department of english meeting hold at duke have virtue other than statistical and feature paper exhibit gratifying qualify of mutual admiration
it be conclude that the most fortunate department be those at small private university like duke no doubt
the issue close with the revelation that the phd
no long require historical distribution
now each program would be shape by the individual student and phd
course speak more directly to the student course of concentrated study and be extremely popular
""
here i begin to see two feature that would become all too characteristic of subsequent issue a emphasis on publicity as opposed to intellectual value the department s favor
the newsletter i would soon realize seldom report anything without first assure the reader it be excellent successful the best or important
this leave the unsettling impression that selfcongratulation publicityseeking and a very dubious curricular freedom have become the order of the day
the spring issue contain a rather bland section on the journal publish by the department
although it focus a bit heavily on the great distinction of these journal the rest of this issue be informative and relatively modest
when fall arrive i be gratify by the long lead article on the great carlyle letter project
this undertaking begin by c xxr sanders in the sixties be a genuinely important work of literary scholarship arguably the fine ever do at duke
a lengthy piece follow however on a new department member professor frank lentricchia who seem a odd choice for duke
he be himself a duke upon in my time
furthermore his recent work have focus on highly theoretical contemporary political and rather narrowly professional subject
after the new criticism his most notable book achieve great success due i suspect to the hope of many bewildered scholar that it would help them make sense of the opaque jargonridden waste of contemporary theory
at one point professor lentricchia toss a crumb in the direction of duke s past commitment to historical literary scholarship but it be clear to anyone familiar with his work that his loyalty lay elsewhere and that a department comprise of lentricchia and others like him would be unlikely to produce another carlyle letter project
indeed his appearance on the scene strongly suggest that a idea of scholarship be begin to obtain that be less catholic literary balance and disinterested than i have know
my suspicion be increase by another piece on the new undergraduate english major which it be say would now concentrate on a student interest primarily in the history of the novel could now mainly take course relate to that interest requirement base on historical literary period would be largely scrap
lest reader consider this approach flimsy ahistorical overly specialize or irresponsible the newsletter assure us that student be require to take a course on a major author chaucer shakespeare or milton
how one course on milton would make much sense to a undergraduate largely read in the history of the novel the newsletter do not indicate
my fear about the duke of crystallized when the piece conclude with the following example of english prose as student recognize the excellence of a english major to later experience both personal and professional we hope to see increased interest in our course continue
it be a use of excellence with which i be unfamiliar
the spring newsletter on first blush bring little bad news
but in the midst of s eliot and robert penn warren there be a incoherent and largely incomprehensible piece by professor gerald monsman on his application of derrida s deconstructive possibility to walter pater and of all people charles lamb
i point out that for pater there be no privileged source of mean within the text not the author s life not the fate of his character not the text s intellectual precursor not the increment append to it by the readercritic but rather that each component generate alternative possibility of meaning because the imagery of the text contain within itself multiple contradictory echo
this passage leave me with three reflection first that this might given deconstructionist assumption be apply to any writer second that professor monsman s prose have benefit little from his study of pater and third that this be a rather ominous straw in the wind regarding the english department
i be at least right about the third reflection
in far reading replace by a fragmented toolong affair involve seven different course each do its own thing teach by faculty from every manner of department and preside over by a resident composition theorist
the crowning touch be that each freshman would choose which course best suit him
this late revelation regarding program reform bring everything into focus
whether freshman senior major or phd
candidate each student be to do whatever be right in his own eye
any concept of common expectation experience and body of knowledge as well as a meaningful core curriculum be clearly become a rare bird at duke
it then dawn on me that without all these not only student but professor also would be blissfully free to pursue merely their own specialized interest
this insight would prove useful in deconstruct later newsletter
look back i see that the first four issue be merely preparatory
their selfcongratulation selfadvertisement general complacency justification of questionable be prelude to the grand announcement in the fall issue that stanley fish be come to duke as be his wife and fellow theorist jane tompkins
it be also note though rather parenthetically that fredric jameson america s foremost marxist critic would soon grace the hall of duke
clearly something big be afoot
we have be tell that the emperor be be fit for a set of magnificent new clothes and now the attendant be arrive with the complete line
just what professor fish s impending presence signify be evident
in accord with his resistance to orthodoxy and impetus to change fish feel that the greatest excitement in literary study today be in feminist study because of the unwillingness to stop at any boundary real and imagine
he note that the revisionary energy of literary study currently rest in feminist study
professor tompkins in a accompanying piece describe her view of literature as a form of political power her suspiciousness literary works that do social work
she indicate that as a populist and feminist critic she like to say that the road from uncle tom s cabin lead to the valley of the doll
even to a reader of limited insight it be evident that professor lentricchia and professor monsman be but humble johnthebaptists to the true prophet
those prophet have now arrive and with a new gospel
the precise nature of that gospel become brilliantly clear in succeeding issue
anything concerning traditional literary study literary history the canon literature per se be out or at least deeply suspect
contemporary theory postmodernism pop culture political approach gay study feminist study and the new historicism with its marxist assumption be the new duke
despite the seeming diversity of these approach their essential sameness be quickly reveal in the newsletter though such revelation could theory
when for instance professor fish be quote in the fall issue as say once you have subtract from the accident of class race gender and political circumstance what be it that you have leave it be perfectly in character
the sort of preoccupation and limitation implicit in professor fish s question quickly come to shape almost everything in the department and this be mirror in the newsletter
thus in the spring issue it be announce that nonperiod specialization would be the new emphasis at duke
such shift in focus require new faculty bring to duke marianna torgorvnick a cultural critic and jane gaine a media critic
the piece on professor gaine be particularly interesting
at one point she indulge in the sort of logic become quite common at duke i have argue that film study belong in english department because this strange presence better answer the question what be literature a close study of those text which be not consider literature
maintain that people in film and television study must find every manifestation of mass culture significant she go on to assure the reader that such scholarship be quite respectable now duke can move ahead with assurance because media study have establish its theoretical pedigree
academic study of film and television be respectably align with the most sophisticated french theory
no doubt
the fall newsletter herald the hiring of another couple professor annabel and lee patterson be the result of another impressive year of recruiting
it be make clear that the patterson be link not only in marriage but also in their commitment to the political study of literature
annabel patterson specifically affiliate herself with the reaction against the reaction against political history
reader would perhaps have like to ask whose political history but that would be frown upon and besides we be all expect to know the answer of the new duke
the first be a lecture by professor fish on the irrelevance of theory for practice in sport literary study and the profession of judge
example come from legal text newspaper article and the career of former baltimore oriole pitcher dennis martinez
the second not totally unrelated perhaps involve the graduate english program no long be specific requirement need to ensure the coverage of historical period of literature and comprehensive examination would cease to be comprehensive and instead focus on a major area
far the foreign language requirement would also be closely tie to the major area
it occur tome that with every reiterated claim of great diversity and range at duke the actual literary and linguistic horizon of its student seem to narrow
the next three newsletter focus on continued hiring and the kind of scholarly activity characteristic of the new duke
the fall issue announce the acquisition of barbara herrnstein smith who apologize for her of herself as always have be a theorist
professor smith s major contribution to theory be that all value be radically contingent
also note be the arrival of some young academic including regina schwartz who combine study of the bible with what else contemporary theory michael moses whose main concern be south american fiction and literary study within the context of political philosophy and michael moon who combine the new historicism and gay study
i then read of john clum s several essay on homosexuality leigh deneef s deconstruction of thomas traherne and joseph porter s exploration of postfeminist tragedy in shakespeare
the highlight of the issue however be its list of visiting professor among them a marxist a feminist and a television theorist with a special interest in soap opera
""
spring stand out for its coy protest that despite recent newspaper account the english department
furthermore it be assert that the classic be teach and abundantly offer as proof the fact that english major be require to take a course on either shakespeare chaucer or milton
what more could one ask
what really get teach at duke be perhaps more candidly reveal in the fall issue
new hire be again note and the star feature be eve kosofsky sedgwick who be quote as observe that if the work do nt have a strong political thrust i do nt see how it matter
such a charge can hardly be level against her
her work center on male sexuality central oppression in our culture and the aids epidemic
what literature professor sedgwick address in this worthy scholarship be not reveal though the newsletter publish the title of two of her paper how to bring your kid up gay and jane austen and the masturbating girl
apparently the classic be not dead at whose interest include contemporary marginal literature
despite his brave commitment to the contemporary he lament his student lack of historical perspective the literature of the s and s be ancient history

compensation however do exist for professor ferraro
he be delighted to be in a department he note in which the godfather be deem a masterpiece
the late newsletter continue to tell the good news about hiring and we read that duke have a new star in black study two new feminist theorist and my favorite a specialist in daily life
this learned person be particularly interested in the scholarly contemplation of aerobics shopping mall barbie doll michael jackson and mickey mouse
i do nt know that we should be very surprised that the department s new mickey mouse authority come to duke after a appointment in the california at santa cruz
as tempting as it be to close on this sublime bit of bathos i really can not do so for despite its rich comic value the new english at duke be not finally funny
if ayear professor at one of america s most expensive and elitist school want to posture as good comrade populist and the vanguard of class struggle probably no lasting harm be do to them
there be undoubtedly however student at duke who would like to study literature
what they be actually study be make all too clear in two of the most recent newsletter
it be note that duke graduate student have give a number of paper lately
and what be we to suppose be their topic some tide be indicative from screwballs to cheeseballs comic narrative and ideology from frank capra to rob reiner fear and loathing in the literary canon
the gynecology of the closet in the changeling a gender paradigm and kierkegaard marxism and poststructuralism
""
this list be to me inexpressibly sad
not only be the dreary sameness of the assumption and preoccupation depressing but completely or almost completely absent be any sign that the author of these works have have any real exposure to the rich beautiful endlessly fascinating and genuinely liberating fullness canonical and noncanonical of english and american literature from anglosaxon time to our own
in the final analysis it be not so much what the duke english department actually do that matter as silly as much of it be rather it be their painful and ultimately absurd desertion of literature as a great human art and as a great instrument of culture in the arnoldian sense that condemn them

should the curriculum include more humanities many thoughtful people think so
they argue that the humanities be need to help us get back in touch with our essential humanity regain our moral insight recover our sense of value return to our cultural root and restore our political traditions like the humanities themselves this argument be inspirational but vague and because it be vague it be dangerous
it leave many question unanswered and this leave room for people to answer these question in way we might not like
here be some of the question that need answering
what exactly be the humanities which course in humanities will student be require to take why should these course be prefer to those they will replace who will teach these course and whose humanity moral insight value culture and tradition will they advance how will these course be teach i believe that these and similar question must whether require more humanities be a good idea or a bad one
the vagueness of the idea of the humanities
if anything can safely be say about this subject it be that the term humanities be not well define
consider the list of course that will satisfy the humanities requirement in my own university s socalled core curriculum this list which be typical contain just under a hundred item and be still grow
in addition to the usual course in literature classic history anthropology philosophy and religion there be also course in art music both jazz and classical dance american study woman s study latin american study communication political science speech film etc
this be a very heterogeneous and divergent lot
these course may have what the philosopher wittgenstein call family resemblance mean that a have eye like b who have a nose like c but there be almost certainly no way in which they all resemble each other
long but that it be too diffuse
no one could object to the richness of choice if it serve a clear and coherent educational purpose but if it do who can say what that be certainly not i each of these course may have its value but the value be different in each case
there do not seem to be anything that all of them have in common
so there do not seem to be any reason to group them all together and require every student to take one or more
it be sometimes say that the humanities all have in common a concern with value
accordingly course in art and literature treat of thing that embody aesthetic value and course in feminism or marxism treat of economic political and moral value
yes but every human activity including science and engineering either treat of or embody value
thus the social science treat of value in discuss human behavior and the physical science embody value by prefer evidence the exclusive possession of the humanities
we could of course try to limit the humanities to particular sort of value
for example we could try limit them to aesthetic value
the humanities would then include nothing but course in art music and literature
woman s study and communication would be leave out
yes but also leave out would be the first two part of northrop frye s famous triad of humanities philosophy history and literature
why not then simply limit the humanities to frye s triad because that would leave nothing out
philosophy history and literature be universal media they cover everything
so once you have include them you have include everything else too
we could leave out the art if we limit the humanities to moral value but we would then have to include woman s study black study economics politics and so on
in fact social science would now comprise most of the humanities desire
evidently it be hard to find a characterization of the humanities that will limit them to a short and welldefined list of thing
in fact every choice be arbitrary
although no single principle rule or definition determine what count among the humanities there be a perfectly good explanation and justification for every item on virtually everybody s list
humanities have add new meaning with each age
why this be so will become evident after we review the history of the concept of the humanities
as this history reveal the word humanities be a chameleon which have change its color to suit every age and ideology
in consequence it have not one welldefined meaning but many different if overlap meaning
so far as i have be able to discover the idea of the humanities originate in the renaissance when scholar tired of medieval theology and otherworldliness distinguished literae humaniores writing about thing human in scale from literae divinae write about thing divine in be give over to god and the church most of the downtoearth writing be in classical latin or greek
therefore the first humanist be classicist lover and scholar of classical literature
more generally they be admirer of thing classical devotee of classical ie greek and roman literature art and culture
present use of the term humanities still retain some of its original meaning but the term have also acquire a very different connotation one that be in some way broad in other way narrow
first the broad connotation
where medieval theology have be dry and logical the classic be elegant and charming
so the adjective humanistic soon come to connote not just the subject but also the style of the writing
in fact style eventually count for more that content
whether the writing be about man or god cease to matter very much what matter be whether it be refined or florid
hence humanities now more often denote what the french anything at all human or divine
once this extension of usage come into existence a still far extension be soon to follow
if what make literature humanistic be its refinement or elegance then the same could be say of all art whether literary or not
accordingly humanities have come to denote not just poem and story but all refined art including painting music sculpture film and the like
as a result humanistic now mean arty in other word refined cultivate and effete
this broadening of the term to include all of the refined art have be accompany by a compensating narrowing
in the renaissance humanist prize classical discussion of science
one of the greatest discovery of humanist scholar be a copy of lucretius poem on the nature of thing which make know to modem scientist the atomic theory of matter first formulate by democritus of classical greece
also of interest to renaissance humanist be roman writing on engineering governmental administration and to adopt the factual analytical manner of the medieval scholastics science and technology cease to count as humanistic
in fact both science and its technological application come to be regard as the embodiment of all thing that be not humanistic
c xxp snow s two culture come into be as science become antihumanistic and humanist become antiscientific
the exclusion of thing scientific be complete in the nineteenth century when the german romantic distinguish what they call geistewissenschaffen study of the spirit from what they call naturwissenschaffen study of the physical world believe that a human being be essentially a spiritual not a physical be the german reinterprete the humanities as inspirational study the main purpose of which be to influence not the intellect but the will and the emotion
this make theology which have originally be the very opposite of a humanistic study into the most important such study
it also mean that science be now formally exclude from the humanities by virtue of its content as well that have flow from science
accordingly humanistic now mean thing ornamental inspirational and cultivated but unscientific and impractical 
in summary the word humanities originally mean the naturalistic writing then the naturalistic art of classical greece and rome
later it signify any form of refined art or writing and then any form of art or write that be edify inspirational or entertaining but not analytical informative or utilitarian
at one time or another therefore humanities have denote just about anything anybody care to mention
give this history it be no wonder that list of the humanities be so lengthy and diffuse
one might desire to prune these list but there be no obvious and principled way to do it
in the history of the term humanities one can find a justification for every item on the list
so whether he like it or not a friend of the humanities be commit to them all
the diverse value of diffuse and divergent collection of thing the customary answer be again one that mention value
we teach the humanities it be say in order to teach our pupil a sense of aesthetic moral political economic or intellectual value
let us now examine this answer
obviously it owe a lot to the romantic conception of the humanities
in that conception the humanities be inspirational rather than scientific study their main function as the romantic themselves emphasize be to cultivate not the intellect but the passion and the will
in other word their business be to inculcate us with certain moral and aesthetic value
where the science teach fact and logic the humanities be to teach feeling obligation and taste
where the science teach us how the world be the humanities teach us what it ought to be
where the science endeavor to understand the world the humanities aspire to take the right attitude towards it and make effort to improve it idea be questionable because it leave out the social science which deal with both fact and value and overlook the fact that natural science embody and teach the value inherent in a preference for reason and truth
however let us overlook these difficulty
for the sake of the discussion let us grant the distinction
how do it help
so far as i can see it do not
here be why once the topic of value have be raise we inevitably face the question whose value mine or yours you like mozart i like monk
who will we teach our student to like you prefer matisse i prefer grandma moses
who will we teach our student to prefer jones favor feminism smith a strong family
which will we teach our student to favor sarah believe in free enterprise sam in socialist equality
which will we teach our student to believe in
to some people the answer will seem to prefer what be beautiful to what be ugly what be good to what be bad what be true to what be false and so on
unfortunately these abstract term truth beauty justice goodness etc conceal great intellectual and practical problem
who get to decide what be to count as true beautiful just or good you i or somebody else
this be no problem where you and i who share essentially the same value be design a curriculum for a private school or university support by voluntary contribution and attend by people who wish to be teach what we wish to teach them
design a curriculum for a public school or university however present a moral difficulty
this arise from the fact that it be contrary to the principle of a free society to compel citizen to pay tax to support the teaching of value that can not be reconcile with their own conscience and interest and it be doubly onerous to compel them the public school be nobody s private property
they do not belong to any group to do with as it please
rather they be the property of all who must pay the tax that support them or submit their child to their tutelage
what be our choice
what then should we do the answer i think lie in give up the idea of use the school to teach student value per se and insist instead that they be teach skill
in particular we can insist they be teach the intellectual skill that use to be know as the liberal art
i believe that in the process of learn these valuable skill student will also automatically acquire some of the most important value namely respect for discipline hard work reason truth honesty excellence achievement civility etc
there will be no need or room for indoctrination
these remark will puzzle some reader
it be generally believe that the humanities and the liberal so it will seem inconsistent to praise the one while condemn the other
it be also widely believe that the main business of teach the humanities be to refine the taste and improve the morality and politics of our pupil
so it will seem selfcontradictory to reject do this while recommend training for citizenship
how the liberal art differ from the humanities
to resolve these paradox i must now explain how the liberal art differ from the humanities and why teaching the skill necessary for good citizenship can escape the temptation to engage in political or moral indoctrination
the idea of the liberal art be invent by the ancient roman to whom the word art mean skill and the word liberal signify free
accordingly the great roman writer cicero and seneca explain that the liberal art be the intellectual skill need by free man as opposed to the menial skill need by slave
among the liberal art as thus understand be the skill of calculate reason read write and responsibility and prerogative as citizen to participate in make or approve policy for the republic
in short the liberal art be the skill need for free and effective citizenship
the term liberal art retain this rich and complex meaning throughout the middle age
in the typical medieval university the basic study be the seven artes liberales which comprise the trivium of logic grammar and rhetoric and the quadrivium of arithmetic geometry astronomy and music ie poetry
high education involve the study of more esoteric subject revealed philosophy ie theology natural philosophy ie science and moral philosophy ie ethics
anyone who go through this curriculum get a liberal education one fit him not to earn a living or enrich himself at a particular occupation but to fulfill his public responsibility as a citizen
he could read write and reason at a very high level of proficiency
it should now be clear that the liberal the concept of the liberal art be far better define
second the liberal art be skill whereas the humanities be subject
third mathematics be one of the most important of the liberal art but it be positively exclude by the romantic conception of the humanities
fourth although they be intellectual rather than occupational skill the liberal art be useful rather than ornamental utilitarian rather than inspirational unlike the humanities as they be presently conceive the liberal art can not be equate with the refined art
finally there be no antagonism between the liberal art and either science or technology
teach the liberal art should be our first priority
my contention broadly state be that we ought to concern ourselves first with instruction in the liberal art
we should make the teaching of the subject embody in the humanities and in the social or natural science a goal of secondary importance to the inculcation of intellectual skill
the reason be obvious
everybody need these skill but few my own experience as a college teacher confirm student these day can not read or write or calculate much less reason effectively
i know from personal experience that we be now graduate with ba and bs degree people who can not write grammatical sentence read and understand paragraph calculate simple percentage or compose a coherently formulate argument thing many eighth grader could do fifty year ago
this be shocking it be shameful and it desperately need to be correct
but we be not go to correct it if we continue to fight over whose value to teach
instead we shall just distract attention from what truly and most urgently need to be do namely restore to our student the capacity to reason seriously
the task may seem insuperable but if we attempt it we have one thing go for us it be in fact a objective that virtually everybody whatever his political or religious conviction can support because virtually everyone will benefit from its realization
art as much of them as we can get
so anybody with any sense want to be able to read and write at as high a level of proficiency as his ability will allow
for this reason alone instruction in the liberal art ought to be one of the main task of public education in a free society
training people in the refined art ought to come second
so should training in the occupational or vocational art as well as training in moral religious and political value
please note that nothing in this proposal either rule out teach the humanities the social science or any other subject or denigrate the importance of expose student to rival value and view of life
it just require that these be teach with a eye to increase the student s level of literacy numeracy and general power of reason
what better way to teach student to read and think than by do it through plato the bible shakespeare jefferson marx or to take course which be aim at influence their attitude and conduct but not at raise their level of intellectual skill
unfortunately humanities course do not always satisfy this standard
in a passionate and eloquent essay on the topic writer and former teacher ellen ashdown have point out that many humanities course in the public junior college be design not to raise the level of student literacy but to accommodate the illiterate student such course use book with lots of picture in them and rather than teach the student to read or write they rub a little high culture off on him while collect his fee
the university have little cause to feel superior
to see why not consider english and history the two most popular field in the humanities
when teach correctly they be excellent vehicle for inculcate the liberal art but they be not always teach in the right way
teach the liberal art be laborintensive it take time professor in the public university have far too many student to thus as william arrowsmith point out long ago the professor of english generally leave the teaching of literacy to their graduate student to whom they teach literature the professor of history do something similar
they teach great mass of student name and date in mindnumbing survey course while graduate student mark the paper
this be not the fault of the professor who be often do as best they can under difficult circumstance but it nonetheless need to be correct
until it be correct we can not automatically expect student to learn the liberal art from study english and history
conclusion
the moral of the story be this a argument can be make for require student especially in the public school to study course whether in the humanities or not when these be teach with a eye to inculcate the liberal art the basic intellectual skill that every citizen require
little argument can be make however for increased study of the humanities where this will have the result of substitute the the basic skill of the intellect and no argument at all in support of use the humanities to indoctrinate student in the moral religious or political value of any group
it will be object that teach people to read write calculate and reason be the business of the grammar and the high school and so it be
but i believe that the college and university should also teach these skill albeit at a high level
furthermore the debate over which level should do it be academic
at the moment neither the grade school nor the institution of high education be teach the liberal art
they must both go back to do so
for reason that the ancient roman understand well but we have somehow manage to forget our preservation as a republic of free citizen may depend on it
this bring us back to politics
as these last remark suggest the purpose of teach the liberal art be political but it be political in the broad and best competency in the liberal art be good for the whole political order and everybody in it
emphasize the primacy of the liberal art be however certainly not political in the narrow and bad but popular sense of that word the liberal art be not partisan they do nt favor the program of this political party over that one they do nt advance one group s interest at the expense of another s
rather possess the liberal art enable every group to advance its own interest and thereby the wellbeing of the whole
section for the record
editor s note the following be adapt from a letter and accompanying essay that be send to each of the regent of the university of california at the close of the spring semester by professor sarich
april 
dear regent
i write to you in your capacity as a regent of the university of california concerning recent admission policy at the university of california at berkeley
my concern over these as both a citizen and longtime member of the berkeley faculty prompt the preparation of the attached longish essay
the essay speak for itself this little note be include simply to introduce it
i will assume that the regent approve these policy
thus i have to ask be nt these policy illegal on their face what sort of legal support can there be for policy that by this year have reduce white among incoming freshman to barely half their number among high school graduate as a whole university of california system be nt they also immoral what other word be there to apply to policy that tell someone well you work hard and really achieve but we can nt reward you for that achievement because your skin be the wrong color
be it so difficult for you to see what you have do to the berkeley campus you have give us two community of student roughly percent in one and percent in the other whose academic achievement prior to come here barely overlap
i assure you it do nt get any better once they be here
one community have be draw from the academic top percent or so the others be only slightly above the average for all high school graduate
what do you suppose be go to happen in any competitive environment and if berkeley cease be competitive it might as well cease be give those circumstance what you have do be to ensure that academic performance and achievement at berkeley will be strongly correlate you wish to teach do you really want to promote segregation and racialethnic tension because that be exactly what you be do
i be send the same letter to all regent
i be well aware that some of you be enthusiastically for these policy and that others be just as against them as i but i really do nt have the time to individualize these nor to figure out which camp you might belong to
preformatted table essay
the san francisco chronicle of january carry a story headline us to probe uc berkeley for bias against white applicant which prompt the thought what be to probe there can be no question that the berkeley administration have over the past few year institute admission policy that have systematically and increasingly discriminate against white student
the basic fact document the presence and extent of bias be clear and readily available even if only rarely present in a useful form
we know that the two main factor determine school academic achievement plus standardized test score and more recently race andor ethnicity as well
we also know the racialethnic composition of the pool of california high school graduate of the roughly percent consider academically eligible for admission to the university of california system and of the new freshman registrant leave out foreign student at berkeley see table 
so white comprise about percent of california high school graduate and close to percent of those academically eligible for admission to the university of california system while the actual white percentage of enter class at berkeley have drop from percent in to percent in 
by then the proportion of white admit have be reduce to barely half their representation among all public high school graduate as well as among the percent academically eligible for admission to the university of california system one have to note here that about percent of freshman admit to berkeley come from private school thus make the situation for white public high school graduate even bad than it would appear at first glance
the only reason for exclude the other half of the academically eligible white be purely and simply the color of their skin
how can there be any doubt of this when a definable group here white do better than average academically even though they make up most of that average and yet be not represent in number that even come close to its proportion in the population concerned high school graduate what else can we conclude the berkeley administration have thus increasingly mock its own nondiscrimination statement
in accordance with applicable federal law and university policy the university of california do not discriminate in any of its policy procedure or practice on the basis of race color national origin sex sexual orientation age or handicap
and of course it may have also violate state in part
no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privilege or immunity of citizen of the united state nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law
while there be a great deal of legitimate debate as to the scope and meaning of the latter no one today will ever openly suggest that there can be a legally sanction administrative power to tell someone you be a member of race x and because of that we be reduce your chance of be admit to our community by more than percent
yet this be precisely what our administration have be tell white california high school graduate in recent year
how much more explicitly racist could one be in addition of course it have be claim that recent admission policy at berkeley be in part a response to legislative pressure result be at substantial variance with the late version of legislative directive in this area each segment of california public education shall strive to approximate by the year the general ethnic gender economic and regional composition of high school graduate both in first year class and subsequent college and university graduate class joint committee for review of the master plan for high education 
leave aside question as to the advisability intelligence and constitutionality of such a policy except to point out its total incompatibility with the mission of high education it be obvious that berkeley s recent incoming class do not even come close to approximate the general ethnic composition of high school graduate and the gap have be grow not close
with regard to that criteria among the admit asian black and hispanic be overrepresented by about percent percent and percent respectively and all this be pay for by percent
but this be really a aside
be nt the ultimate nonpragmatic fact constitutional one can not legally choose someone because of the color of his skin
period
it be thus a depressing commentary on our time that the berkeley administration have be allow to get away with such policy that chancellor ira michael heyman could state at the news conference announce his leave the post that he be proud of the increase in the ethnic diversity of the undergraduate student body under his administration and that the berkeley academic senate could approve the recommendation of the karabel report the vacuity of the last which be the berkeley faculty s response to perceived problem with recent admission policy can be see in the fact that it be simply not possible to follow their fourth principle
berkeley will absolutely not tolerate quota or ceiling on the admission or enrollment of any racial ethnic religious or gender group
such quota or ceiling be both immoral and illegal
moreover any of the criteria govern its admission policy
""
principle which be set in absolute term can not be uphold in the presence of a policy where percent of the freshman class be to be select through a process of secondary review where within each secondary review category roughly half the target would be meet by accept those applicant with the high academic index score and where one of the factor for the other half would be contribution to the overall diversity of the class
of course as we might have expect one of these secondary review category remain affirmative action student black hispanic american indian
give all this it be not at all surprising to note that we find the statement the flexible admission target for each group would be set primarily on the basis of recent practice and we therefore anticipate that there will be no drastic fluctuation in the number from each of these group to represent some sort of advance quota by any other name be still quota and we as a faculty by our approval of the report be endorse the continued destruction of any sense of community on the berkeley campus
there have also be remarkably little if any overt public outcry over these policy though by the same token there be little or no evidence of public approval
there seem to be a general if apathetic acceptance of the notion that their goal be noble equitable and wellintentioned and implicitly that this somehow justify a unconstitutional practice
one might note here that all too much depressing contemporary history tell us that the road to many recent hell have be pave with good intention
there be in addition of course a good deal of white guilt around and a welljustified fear of be tag with a racist label if one question policy that have acquire affirmative action status
well if this effort it
that begin to get us into pragmatic matter
it be unfortunate another aspect of our time that one should have to get into pragmatic matter at all when the policy at issue be prima facie unconstitutional
it should be possible to say simply you can not discriminate for or against someone because of the color of his skin
but in today s california this for the quiet majority be a elitist and esoteric attitude
very few find a purely constitutional debate at all satisfying
thus much of the justification and defense of berkeley admission policy have be pragmatic in appearance though the reality as will be see have be a good deal less
one might start with the fact that what have happen to white student have be obscure by the continuing and largely irrelevant controversy concerning the admission of student of asian ancestry
a conspiracy theorist could readily conclude in fact that it be concoct for precisely this purpose
concerned white black asian hispanic it turn out that only asian be be admit to berkeley in proportion that do not differ significantly from their representation in the pool of academically eligible high school graduate see table above and this have be true for a great many year
the number and they be not hard to come by make this so clear that one really have to wonder what all the fuss have be about
for asian then raceethnicity be not a significant factor except for the fact that their meritocratic treatment be so at variance with what be do to everyone else
in other word asian have be and be be treat fairly with respect to their academic achievement
the problem then be not with them they be be treat just as they always have be it lie instead in the fact that no one else be treat fairly in the chance of white student be admit be reduce by more than percent just by the defect of their whiteness and the chance of hispanic and black be correspondingly increase by percent and percent respectively compare row three and five in table again simply on the basis of their race and ethnicity
this be racism pure and simple and easily reminiscent of the infamous negative quota limit jewish enrollment in many of our most prestigious university which survive well into the s
it be difficult to conceive of ground on which so racially bind a policy could be defend in court
now it have be argue in particular by chancellor heyman and vicechancellor rod park that to quote the former these achievement be not at the expense of quality as some have claim san francisco chronicle january 
another common claim to quote administration official be that everyone admit to insight october 
such statement be at best halftruth
they can be get away with only by never define term like university of californiaeligible or academically qualify and by never tell us at whose expense these achievement be manage
about the only actual datum ever refer to in this context be the fact that the mean scholastic aptitude test sit score of incoming student have be steadily rise
given that for all its fault the sit score be the only objective standin for quality that can be apply to all student it be the only academic experience they share let us look into what have actually be go on see table 
asian and white admit to berkeley in and almost always on academic ground alone have a average sit score of about black and hispanic for the vast majority of whom raceethnicity about for the former note that this be also just about the mean for all white high school senior who take the test for the latter
ten year previously in the corresponding figure be about for asian and white and about for black and hispanic
thus the gap between the two mean have increase by more than point in the past decade from to lead to a situation of minimal overlap percent or less between the two distribution
this current difference be equivalent to a fouryear gap in academic preparationachievement in other word the difference between a college junior and a high school junior
this enormous and growing disparity tell us that on the average minority group student be not go to be competitive with asian and white at berkeley
and whatever the fault of the sit or any standardized achievement test truth be see crudely in dropout figure but be much more apparent to those of us who spend much of our time teach undergraduate in relative performance in the same class and in the lack of minority representation in our more demanding course and major
all this be depressing and most unfortunate but nonetheless true as you get more and more selective among asian and white the competitive gap necessarily increase
this be simple statistics and nothing anyone here at berkeley can do short of admit only those asian and white who score below say could change it
this fact have be obscure by avoid any mention of the actual number involve
sometimes this avoidance be blatant as in the information digest of the university of california admission and outreach service where on page we be give in one table the sit score of university of california freshman as a whole as compare to national mean and in but not of course sit data by raceethnicity
indeed to the best of my knowledge raceethnicity sit data for berkeley student have never be publish
what we have get be statement of the type quote above from chancellor heyman and endorse in many place include unfortunately the karabel report the great accomplishment of the overall admission policy have in our view be its capacity to continue the process of diversification of berkeley s student body at the same time it have maintain and even raise the academic level of the freshman class 
there be in fact as just note no positive accomplishment at all
the gap between asianswhites and blackshispanics to repeat have increase
the administration have simply trade off large gain among asian and white large because one be select them from far out along the curve for small one among black and hispanic
their great accomplishment academic level that is the mean sit score of the freshman class while continue the process of diversification of berkeley s student body result from this tradeoff
and the claim blithely ignore the fact that the admission policy have also produce two student population percent and percent respectively of the freshman enrollee whose academic level barely overlap
so while the overall quality that is mean sit score of undergraduate may not have decline the relationship between quality and race or ethnicity have become much more strongly marked and the overall quality have certainly decline relative to where it would be if admission policy be as blind to raceethnicity as they be seven year ago
the problem with the concept of the quality of a performance with respect to reward in a world of limited good ie the number of place at berkeley be fix be that it can not be apply in other than if and only if one be willing and able to perform academically at a level commensurate with the demand of the institution and the overall response of the student body to those demand
therefore once one become at all selective that is once something pass from be a right for example the right to compete for a position in a band play or on a athletic team to a privilege a actual position then qualify have to become to a appreciable extent a performancebased term
no one would suggest to lou campanelli that he should recruit with a eye to increasing diversity on our basketball team
nor would anyone look for racialethnic diversity and balance on our olympic squad
there we choose on the basis of performance
why because presumably we want to do the best that we can do
why should it be any different for our faculty and student body the university of california at berkeley have be three best institution of high learning public or private in this country and probably in the world and be the best mean among other thing be selective and challenging
we do not achieve that eminence by concern ourselves with anything other than direct evidence of achievement
that eminence obviously can not be maintain if race sex ethnicity or any other factor be allow to substitute for achievement
there can not possibly be if we wish to maintain that eminence a performanceindependent right to membership in the university community and to repeat performance whether academic athletic or artistic can not be judge against absolute standard
any such judgment must be make in a comparative context
you get performance by rewarding performance you ensure nonperformance by rewarding nonperformance
intellectual performance be no exception
not to challenge our best student mind and we certainly can nt challenge them if they be not here nor can the strength of our challenge be as great now our society and the world later and to fail in our mission
to remain the best we must do our intellectual best but when we do that best we raise the required level of performance and degree of competition to the point where less qualified less prepared or less motivated student simply become noncompetitive
and unfortunately the level of qualification preparation or motivation be not randomly distribute with respect to race and ethnicity
it would be much more realistic to recognize the accomplishment of the berkeley administration as consist of the alienation of white by not admit them and of minority by admit them into a environment where they will tend to do poorly relative to others of course and therefore come to feel quite rightly cheat
such policy also and this be perhaps the sad result of all devalue the accomplishment of those minority student who be make it on their own without the benefit at least in theory provide some benefit but diversity in current practice here at berkeley be something else again
those potential benefit do not accrue automatically in the presence of increased diversity and there be alltooreal cost as well
but where do we see any attempt even to consider the cost never mind measure them against the potential benefit the cost be obvious and large the benefit if any difficult to perceive and certainly undocumented
we do need to understand better the difference and similarity among culture their strength as well as weakness and to appreciate that there be much we can learn from one another
but we must also be aware that belief and practice where they differ from culture to culture can not in general be neutral that is be equally effective in any particular situation
the academic environment at berkeley be a very particular situation and clearly performance within it be not neutral with respect to race and ethnicity nor obviously though attention be it neutral with respect to individual variation within group
that be the reality
it be of course all to easy to ignore unpalatable reality
unfortunately do so tend to produce even more unpalatable result
the berkeley administration have in its admission policy especially over the past five year or so ignore certain unpalatable reality and give us a even more unpalatable set of result
they have give us a situation where the association between raceethnicity and performance be real obvious and of everincreasing strength
what we be get at berkeley be two community separable on racialethnic ground and increasingly divergent from one another academically socially and in ethos a result desire presumably by no rational soul
it be frankly difficult to imagine policy more deliberately craft or better calculate to exacerbate racial and ethnic tension discourage individual performance among all group and contribute to the decay of a magnificent educational institution
postscript
my early comment be of course incomplete be all too easy to complain it be sometimes a good deal hard to suggest something better
i do nt see that as the case here
it seem to me quite easy to define a range of policy that would be constitutional be see as fair and be more or less compatible with the mission of this university
at one end we could have a purely meritocratic system that is we could simply define a set of performance criteria and select in order from those who fulfill them make certain that nothing be add to or subtract from student score because of what they be rather than what they have do
at the other we could simply admit the top x percent by performance where x be the same for all group of each defined group
it would be difficult to justify representation in number great than those merit by performance when that performance be above average by the same token it would be difficult relevant population here all high school graduate when the performance be below average
in other word the final total for each defined group would be somewhere between the figure in the last two row of table 
i leave unargued the question of whether the whole notion of defined group in this context be relevant moral fair or productive

section issue
report issue by the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teach be a mean by which the educational establishment build public support for the policy it favor
its report exhibit highmindedness expose genuine problem and propose solution that require ever great quantity of administration
the carnegie foundation s late report campus life in search of community fit this description except that the solution it urge be clearly unsupported indeed contradict by the fact it present
the erosion of learning and civility
college student spend on the average much less time study than even the gloomy of us have think
the carnegie foundation report the following conclusion from a unpublished study of fulltime student in fouryear college in percent spend less than six hour a week study outside of class and no more than percent spend sixteen or more hour study by percent be spend less than six hour a week study and only percent spend more than percent of fulltime student at fouryear college be spend sixteen or fewer hour on their course work outside of class
since the standard number of class hour be ten to twelve and a half per week twelve to fifteen fiftyminute hour this mean that in more than three quarter of our student be engage in academic work less than twentyeight and a half hour a week even if they never skip a class while almost a third work less than eighteen and a half hour per week
the decline in hour spend study have to be consider against the background fact that student come to college much less well prepare than in the past
the carnegie report contain no data on this matter but it do mention a survey of professor in which twothirds said they be teach undergraduate basic skill they should have learn in school
particular professor at different type of institution be quote as say that student ability even to do simple arithmetic have define that they and so on
in short just when they should be work hard to make up for the deficiency of their past education american student be work fewer hour than ever
and during those hour they study less well than they once do
the quality of student life outside of academic work only add to one s wish that student would spend more time study
the carnegie report be base in part on a survey of college and university president
seventyfive percent of the president of liberal art college say that alcohol abuse be a moderate to major problem on their campus
eightytwo percent of the president of university research and doctorategranting institution say the same
one dean of student estimate that between and percent of the undergraduate at his school a prestigious southern university be alcoholic while another to percent be serious weekend drinker
the grim news about university doubtless pertain to their large undergraduate population rather than to their president complain of sexual harassment on their campus as opposed to percent of college president probably reflect the fact that opportunity and temptation be great within graduate program and for male graduate student who serve as teach assistant in undergraduate course
in any case university be clearly tough place to be and not just for woman
thirtyeight percent of college president believe theft to be a moderate to major problem while the figure for university president be percent
this document place a major emphasis on racial tension though the statistics shocking and depressing as they be do not indicate that race be the greatest problem on campus
twentyeight percent of college president and percent of university president say that racial tension be a moderate to major problem on their campus and percent and percent respectively say that racial intimidationharassment be
however whereas percent of college president and percent of university president cite interracial intercultural relation as a issue of greatest concern substance abuse primarily alcohol as be of greatest concern
all institution together which include twoyear college and comprehensive institution ie those not primarily liberal art rank substance abuse student apathy campus security and crime and inadequate facility ahead of toolong relation as area of concern
the carnegie report be also base on a survey of chief student affair officer
whereas percent of those personnel at liberal art college and percent at university believe that racial tensionshostilities have become a great problem over the past five year percent and percent respectively believe that alcohol abuse have become a great problem over the same period
considering the importance of word within a academic community one sentence in this report be particularly strike on too many campus incivility be a problem and all too frequently word be use not as the key to understanding but as weapon of assault
the author go on to cite disturbing
the carnegie foundation s proposed solution
there be in campus life surprisingly litre analysis of the deterioration report and almost no consideration of its cause
no thought be give to the possibility that drunkenness be a function of excessive leisure time and that racial incident might be promote by drunkenness
racial tension be highlight as a especially severe problem just as if those tension be root in racism pure and simple
then the report leap from these unconnected particulars to a single allembracing solution that is if not unrelated to the problem to be solve at least inadequate to their solution
the carnegie foundation call upon each school administration to form a new compact for community with its student body
the six principle of that compact be elaborate in the six chapter that form the body of this report
those chapter be seriatim a purposeful community wherein it be admit and rarely thereafter remember that a college or university be a place a open community wherein a delicate adjustment be achieve between protect freedom of expression and affirm civility a just community which urge the affirmative action and multicultural education package already so popular among college and university administrator a disciplined community which review the many way in which existing rule be be violate and offer little to rectify matter a caring community which tilt against fraternity and toward more support service for student to be provide by expanded student affair staff and a celebrative community which recommend traditional ceremony and ceremonial tradition
a epilogue follow these six chapter give the gist of what be propose we be convinced that all part of campus life can relate to one another and contribute to a sense of wholeness
it be of special significance we believe that high learning institution continue to use the familiar rhetoric of community to describe campus life
that ideal and rhetoric be the mean propose for achieve it
at least that be what at one level seem to be propose
however it would be a great mistake to dismiss this compact for community as nothing more than a empty exercise in communitarian rhetoric
for the compact once make can be put to some interesting use
the epilogue suggest begin with a campuswide forum to discuss a compact for community proceed to the compact s ratification by the board of trustee and then use it as a framework within which to evaluate policy and to make decision on such matter as the appropriateness of new student organization or the worthiness of existing one
in short while the compact itself will make little difference administrator can use a compact once ratify to justify action that might otherwise be resist by faculty student alumnus and parent
the epilogue ask and could student faculty and ado from inviting speaker or entertainment group to plan course to academic evaluation and even hire personnel yes they could
it behoove us therefore to examine the specific tendency that the carnegie foundation s proposal encourage
civility and academic freedom
chapter a open community address one of the most difficult and most discussed issue on campus today namely the need to combat the decline of civility while not infringe on academic freedom and freedom of speech
on the one hand there be a alarming increase in vulgar and abusive speech direct against other person often employ the most foul language of sexual racial and ethnic disparagement
on the other hand there be attempt by many college and university to curb such speech but in way that censor the expression of view run counter to the prevailing orthodoxy of the civil right establishment feminism and the gay right movement
the carnegie foundation take the position that academic freedom must be uncompromisingly protect but that the latter nevertheless can and should be condemn in the strong possible term
""
as strong feeling be always arouse by violation of substantive value than by violation of procedural value the carnegie foundation deserve credit for support procedural over substantive value in this case
nevertheless there be two problem with the carnegie foundation s recommendation
the first be that it extend the protection of academic freedom to purely abusive speech personal insult obscene language and racial slur even if they be entirely unconnected with any expression of opinion
pure abuse could be subject to institutional sanction even as the expression of idea opinion and theory no matter how offensive some of these may be to particular group be protect
perhaps the carnegie foundation feel that the distinction between pure abuse and offensive opinion be too difficult to draw
but if that distinction can not be draw then their recommendation be problematic in a second way
for it license or even encourage administrative condemnation be distinguish from the expression of opinion some deem offensive then this be also license and encouragement to condemn currently unpopular opinion
presidential or institutional condemnation be a powerful weapon especially in a small intimate liberal art college
therefore those in authority ought not to resort to condemnation lightly
even to express disagreement be often inadvisable for those in authority when they do express it their disagreement ought to be clearly distinguish from condemnation
hence a distinction must be draw between abusive speech which be to be condemn and unpopular speech with which one may at most disagree
this be a matter of some moment as university and college authority in the past few year often have be guilty of condemn as insensitive or as racist sexist or homophobic speech that at bad take misguided issue with prevailing view and often present entirely plausible criticism of those view
there be less need to counsel administrator to condemn abusive speech of unpopular view
the carnegie report by neglect these consideration might be misread by some as grant a license to condemn student or faculty who question contemporary piety
indeed there be nothing in the report to indicate that would be a misreading
a related omission also detract far from the virtue of chapter 
while the use of racial and similar slur be rightly denounce there be no explicit recognition of other class of term that be be use offensively on campus today
for example faculty and student who be very far from be racist but who question the wisdom or justice of affirmative action policy be regularly subject to public charge of racism by their colleague
now in the present climate of opinion where nearly everyone condemn racism there be no more insulting epithet than racist
furthermore it be the most damaging epithet
a racial slur however much it may wound one s feeling damage the reputation only of he who cast it give credence do enduring harm to a faculty member and very great if only temporary damage to a student
if college and university president be to be urge to condemn the use of racial slur should they not also be urge to condemn the far more frequent and damaging practice of unjustly charging others with racism
the same of course would apply to a string of other epithetsoffavor such as sexist homophobe and fascist
consider the situation on american campus almost everyone condemn racism sexism prejudicial treatment of homosexual and so on while relatively few and those few tend to be drunken studentsare guilty of express the prejudice condemn
it therefore require no courage for a college president or for the carnegie foundation to speak out against racial and similar slur
that be like mount one s moral high horse in the safety of the stable yard surround by helpful stable hand and eager wellwisher
actually to risk himself will have to ride his steed against the phalanx of those who huff charge of racism sexism and fascism against all those who dare question their opinion
the carnegie foundation be less than evenhanded approach to the problem of word use as weapon of assault undermine the effectiveness of what be recommend
for the the breakdown of civility within high education be not limit to the tiny minority of college student who slur those of another race or sex
it be a pervasive phenomenon
and to attack but one small part of it be likely to make thing bad rather than better
i believe we could proceed with much more strength against abusive speech than this report recommend if first we be careful to distinguish abusive speech from the expression of unpopular opinion and second we proceed against abusive speech in all of its form
affirmative action affirm
chapter claim that a just community be one where diversity be aggressively pursue
this timetable until the number of minority in high education at least match their representation in the population
there be no indication that this must depend on primary and secondary school first prepare such a proportion of minority student for high education
presumably then aggressive pursuit of diversity require low standard of admission for minority student
since most high education administrator be already vigorously push affirmative action program the carnegie foundation be preach to the converted
the real purpose of the document be to hand the missionary of affirmative action another argument this be what the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching recommend
but since affirmative action have be go on for some time we already know that it have have some disastrous consequence
these be conveniently ignore in the present report
for example there be no mention of the argument by john bunzel thomas sowell and others that minority student suffer a extraordinarily high dropout rate probably in consequence of have be entice to institution to these student in wasted time and crippled selfconfidence be enormous
it be also a great cost to society which lose the potential contribution of those who could have obtain a respectable education at less demanding institution
for many of these abused student will not try again
they be the victim of a educational establishment eager to purchase selfapprobation at any cost to those they be pretend to help
simple decency not to mention professional responsibility require educator engage in the aggressive pursuit of minority student to provide remedial education to those who need it
alas that be rare
and when the author of this report inform us that the issue be more than access it have to do with the lack of support minority student feel once they have enroll it be not remedial education they have in mind
instead it be some undefined form of support key to race or ethnicity
chapter also contain a extended discussion of racial division and racial tension on american to cleave together in organization form for themselves exclusively and of how those same organization also exacerbate those division and tension
the difficult issue thus raise be entirely real
minority student on many campus do feel a desperate need for social group within which for a time they will feel less like a minority exhibit
yet that grouping only make them more separate from the rest of the student body
the carnegie foundation appear unable to decide whether racially and ethnically exclusive student group be or be not a good thing
the only advice offer be that such group should reach out authentically to one another
no hint be give as to how that might be do except for the suggestion of a summer retreat in which student leader can seek a common ground within the six principle set forth in this report
but how can a report that lack a solution to a problem be a solution to that problem
have fail to address the real difficulty of minority recruitment serious situation of minority student on american campus chapter plunge next into curricular matter
above all college and university should seek to build racial and cultural understanding not just socially but educationally as well
student should take time in their formal program of instruction to learn about the heritage and tradition of other racial and ethnic group emphasis in original
the same theme be then develop with respect to woman s study which be laud for its impressive gain
once again the preaching be to the converted
once again familiar idea already widely enact be urge
once again all criticism of those idea be ignore
there be not even a hint that woman s study socalled multicultural education and other ideologicallyloaded attempt to use the curriculum to reform society have ever be criticize
because there be no consideration of other view there be no effective defense of the view present
since nothing be say to counter the objection that affirmative action and to the underqualified minority student condemn to failure one be leave to conclude that this just community will in fact be doubly unjust
the professionalization of caring
chapter on the breakdown of discipline in the academy be important for the information it convey
but the step it recommend better lighting escort service emergency phone system and a strengthened police force are as unremarkable as they be sadly necessary
seminar on safety date rape and the art of selfdefense be urge as be new code of conduct but nothing be say about the cause of this unraveling of campus life
chapter on the importance of celebrate tradition also offer no concrete suggestion worth discuss
by contrast chapter a caring community contain a number of proposal that warrant our attention
that chapter argue for expanded student affair staff and the support service that such staff be supposed to provide
student affair be for student of all age to receive support especially student on the margin
these professional be the people who often put a human face on the institution
many of the student sense that program create by student affair staff provide care outside the classroom
we urge that such service be expand and well support by every institution
as well as add more program to be run by student affair staff it be suggest that the office of these professional be keep open more hour and even staff by night shift of those train and ready to provide caring
""
when student organize into fraternity and sorority they provide for themselves some of the same emotional support and sense of belong that student affair personnel be hire to provide
yet in this report those organization be view with a hostility illdisguised as suspicion
while problem of racially exclusive black student union and the like be discuss inconclusively the carnegie report leave us in no doubt that fraternity and sorority be especially wrong reason emphasis add
what those reason be be not state
the implication perhaps be that they exclude minority
but that be no long true integrated fraternity be now the norm
yet instead of explain its dark comment the report hasten onward to complain of the destructive behavior of fraternity
strangely the evidence collect in the report s survey of student affair officer convey a unexpected image of fraternity life
while percent of those officer at liberal art college and percent at all institution together say that the number of residence hall violation have increase only percent and percent respectively say that fraternitysorority violation have increase
similarly more regard the severity of residence hall violation to have increase percent and percent than think the same about fraternity violation percent both for liberal art college and for all institution
these data imply that fraternity and sorority be resist the erosion of community less ineffectively than student affair the latter toward the former
the chapter conclude by urge several modification of the academic program which if enact would effectively subordinate that program to a social work or a social reform agenda
we urge that all student be encourage to complete a community service project as a integral part of the undergraduate experience
student also should be bring in touch with those genuinely in need and through field experience build relationship that be intergenerational intercultural and international too
in the end the campus should be view not only as a place of introspection but also as a staging ground for action
introspection versus action be those the only alternative be introspection a proper description of liberal education what do that description imply about the author attitude toward the art and science do its wording reflect the view of scholar and teacher or of some other sort of academic professional
the carnegie report be grace with a prologue where this true statement may now divide into almost wholly separate world and student life concern have become the province of a separate staff with a dizzying array of service provide
indeed the array be not only dizzying but distract
at least it have distract the author of this report from the educational purpose of educational institution
if the service be already so numerous as to be dizzying then why still more be student really better off be so bountifully care for be the apathy and passivity and perhaps the irresponsibility too of today s student all of which be complain of by the president and student affair officer survey possibly a effect of these service those question be not ask
instead the driving force behind these recommendation seem to be a desire for a unified program that reintegrate the academic and the nonacademic
in effect it recommend submerge academic work in even more student service and infuse it with yet more emphasis on to imagine alternative solution that be at least as plausible as that find in the carnegie foundation s report
for example one way to reintegrate student life with the academic purpose of college and university would be to return the focus of the academy to academic work
this could be achieve by pare back student affair staff by return professor to the classroom and by insist that student spend more hour on course work
it would help too if college maintain high academic standard for admission grade graduation and faculty recruitment and promotion not pervert by nonacademic goal no matter how laudable the latter may be
just think what would be achieve by even so simple a reform as make professor demand more from their student
not only would student graduate better educate but they would have fewer empty hour to pass away by drinking and thus not only would the problem of alcoholism be address but also the related one of violence including racial violence
of administrative action and not more administrator which go against the natural disposition of human to prefer company over work
the many way in which the recommendation of chapter serve the interest of university and college administrator should be note
the community service project and field experience will require additional administrative staff since they be form of education that require administration instead of teaching
the expansion of student affair staff and student support service even if only to provide for a night shift similarly result in a increase in the number of those who must answer to senior administrator
now unlike faculty member lowerlevel administrator and other nonacademic staff do not enjoy the protection of tenure
nor do they have any independent ground to stand upon such as that which a faculty member find in his academic discipline
rarely do they have any professional recognition or strength outside of their service to their institution as measure by the senior administrator to whom they report those faculty may derive from their respective study that might inspire opposition to the president s vision of what high education be all about
the president at the head of this swelling body of functionary be like the general of a mighty army overwhelming by sheer number the voice and mind of the academic faculty
thereby he be able to impose his own image on the entire institution
and his prestige and salary too must reflect the number of those whom he command
academic purpose
after all this it be a little difficult to take seriously the opening sentence of chapter we list the principle of educational purposefulness first because it be fundamental to all others and if faculty and student do not join in a common intellectual quest then all talk about strengthen community be simply a diversion
besides the rest of chapter be as much at odds with those sentiment as be the other chapter
for example in this chapter should learn to cooperate not just compete
who say so and why why not let the subject matter dictate the best approach to it who determine that however much cooperation be to be value elsewhere it promote learning or be it not assume that it promote learning but then be learning be subordinate to some other goal indeed to the sort of goal favor by professional in care on the basis of the unsupported assumption that college and university professor have some obligation to teach student to cooperate it be recommend that student have at least one small seminar course each semester
far we urge that all student work together occasionally on group assignment to underscore the point that cooperation in the classroom be as essential as competition
""
next academic department be urge to become center of community but event that cut across departmental interest such as allcollege seminar and forum be also recommend
berkeley student who hall and earlham college whose dining hall table be often cover with handout on social issue be single out for praise
and so on in successive step away from the curriculum until we be jerk gently back to that topic with the thought that share intellectual discourse can be achieve most successfully perhaps through a wellplanned general education sequence a core curriculum with coherence
""
many reader who would otherwise be appall by this document will agree that the curriculum must illuminate large more integrative end
perhaps however they will come to share my doubt about such grand design as they reflect on the sort of integrarive end that be likely to occur to the carnegie foundation and those whose thinking it reflect
as it happen the example cite be nothing very objectionable nor very integrative
one college specify ten area of study another eight category of perspective a third a cluster of course unite by a theme within whose benign or not these recommendation do not begin to address the problem that chapter begin by recite the fact that student be illprepared for college work do not know how to concentrate and devote very few hour a week to study
in fact the group project allcollege forum departmental social event and some of the other activity urge therein would serve only far to distract student from their study
be this report to address the problem it cite it would speak to the question of whether college and university should expand their program of remedial education or raise their admission standard
it would provide some suggestion for how administrator could enforce a general increase in the amount of work professor require of their student
and it would consider how to get student to accept that salutary revolution
since most student these day have a great deal to say about where they go to school and since most college be vulnerable to market pressure it will be almost impossible to increase work agree to act in concert
concerted action of that type be precisely what the carnegie foundation be wellpositioned to promote and indeed orchestrate
but such a reform would result in more work for everyone
furthermore it would not increase administrator role in education it would not slide in on rhetorical unction and it would not cost more money
therefore it be not a reform likely to be make
though it fail actually to recommend a change in the reward system by which faculty be now encourage to devote more of their energy to research than to teaching this chapter s brief discussion of that system and its consequence be one of its more pertinent moment
herein the educational establishment belatedly recognize the problem that a journalist so rudely name profscam
still not deign to admit that they have read charles sykes s book of that title the establishment nonetheless show sign of have hear from indignant citizen who do read it
yet one could wish for a write this report
for example just as sykes have be criticize for do they ignore the distinction between institution whose first priority be rightly research and those whose first priority ought to be teach
in addition this report would have be the place to point out that the flight from teaching of which sykes complain be not purely a scam and be not wholly due to a system that reward research before teaching
for it be also due to the very problem that this chapter pretend to address
when college student be neither able nor willing to do collegelevel work it be natural for professor to become demoralized and turn their energy away from teaching and into line of work where they feel they might be more productive
sixties communitarianism
the idea that evidently inspire the carnegie report be of a unmistakable provenance
those idea be they allow to guide us would lead american education in a direction repugnant to most american
ernest l boyer the carnegie foundation s president say the campus turbulence of the s with mixed emotion
they be time of anger and fear but also of intense yet honest discourse with caring student that reveal what a true community of learning be all about
a community of learning it turn out remove student from library and laboratory so that they may participate in teachin
the teachin at their best boyer say bring faculty and student out of their box into forum where large more consequential issue be consider
""
let us recall the character of those forum and the consequential issue discuss
student who have not yet master the rudiment of any intellectual discipline presume to lecture actually to harangue other student and the faculty on complex issue of american foreign policy
be a community especially a community of learn best model on large meeting in which the emotion of many be work upon by the fanaticism of a few
yet boyer regret that the s his only example of the downside of the sixties be the kent state shooting
he appear to have forget that altruism also lead to violence on the part of the altruistic
he have forget or choose to ignore the bombing of the university of wisconsin computer facility and the many threat of similar bombing
he do not mention the destruction of professor research or the fact that the majority of student who want to attend class be often prevent from do so
the idea in boyer s foreword and in the report that follow it seem to be to institutionalize this s idea of community and to impose it on today s student since they seem unwilling to create it for themselves
student today be belittle as more concerned about credential than confrontation
do boyer really mean to recommend confrontation be credential so bad be there nothing between those two alternative such as the learning that credential be supposed to represent throughout this but by invidious comparison to a vaguely communitarian ideal
serve the educational need of each student must remain a top priority in high education but private concern while important be insufficient the epilogue tell us
of course they be insufficient if by private concern we mean something invariably selfish
but be the concern of a student to become liberally educate necessarily selfish will not that education make him a better citizen be his concern to learn engineering or nursing or law selfish will not such study make him a more valuable contributor to society what far social goal should college or university teach their student will not the attempt to inculcate those goal interfere with the proper and possibly more important job of educate young people
when the epilogue state that we need educated man and woman who not only pursue their own personal interest but also be prepare to fulfill their social and civic obligation it make it sound as if do a good job society
but be not the businessman who create a more efficient way to market his product or to finance his operation also contribute perhaps even more than when he donate some of the resulting profit to a charity similarly a student who apply himself to his study be do the best thing he can be do not just for himself but for society since he be prepare himself for great service to society
the communitarian ideal that lead one to denigrate competition private purpose and individual effort also be hostile to private association voluntarily enter into such as fraternity
in fraternity and sorority student be free momentarily from the influence of the large institution
one vice chancellor be quote with approval as complain that there be a magnetism that tug at subgroup pull them away from any common agenda
well why should there be a common agenda be it healthy especially in a democracy for the administration or any majority of faculty to impression that the author of this document be unacquainted with concept of tyranny of the majority and freedom of association
the desire to achieve unity on campus be only the beginning
boyer in his foreword conclude that high education have a important obligation not only to celebrate diversity but also to define large more inspired goal and in do so serve as a model for the nation and the world
again in the concluding word of the epilogue in our hardedged competitive world more humane more integrative purpose must de define
and perhaps it be not too much to hope that as college and university affirm a new vision of community on campus they may also promote the common good in the neighborhood the nation and the world
no hard edge here only megalomania
but this new left cant be only one form that a misplaced humanitarian impulse can take
there be a reason many educational leader be more interested in humanitarian than in academic public support for high education and humanitarian goal be unquestionably good albeit easily distort
the value of a liberal education be hard to define much less defend
thus it be nor surprising that many of those who speak for high education resort to the easy argument which make high education s purpose humanitarian
the danger be that they will end up believe it themselves
then as in this report they will begin to insist that academic institution conform to those argument and pursue humanitarian goal at the expense of academic goal
thus they may turn those institution from their true purpose and in the name of lofty goal make them less useful to society than they have be
we need educational leader who understand what education be and how it serve society
the mind of the blob
campus life have no author
as it be issue by the foundation of which he be president ernest l boyer clearly bear major responsibility for it yet his name appear only as the author latter he give credit to a large number of person from both the carnegie foundation and the american council on education ace and say that the project be in every respect a collaborative endeavor of the two organization
ace like the carnegie foundation represent the view of administrator
it be support by dues pay by college and university and by various national and regional high education association
those who attend its meeting be predominantly college and university president and other senior administrator
thus this report represent the corporate thinking of the high education establishment that group that a former secretary of education impolitely name the blob
""
not merely be it write by those who represent administrator this report be also base on a careful survey of the opinion of administrator and on very little else
its sixtyeight page of statistical appendix consist entirely of two set of table one represent a opinion survey of college and university president and the other a survey of chief student putatively direct to those same administrator this report read very much as if one be overhear the blob talk to itself
and in fact the table append to the report as well as the report s text provide a illuminating glimpse into the mind of high education s establishment
a comfortableness with contradiction seem to be that mind s most salient characteristic
the report s prologue begin american high education be by almost any measure a remarkable success yet not long after we be tell that student underprepared for college work can graduate after have study only six hour per week
similarly college and university be praise for the enormous growth in their student affair staff even though that growth have be accompany by a proportionate decline in civility and learning
this last discrepancy mirror some very interesting attitude reveal in the survey of chief student affair officer
seventythree percent of those officer at liberal art college believe that the quality of campus life be better percent believe it to be not as good
the past five year as we have see be a period during which student affair staff have grow enormously
yet the answer of the same respondent to specific question bear on the quality of campus life contradict their overall judgment in every particular
seventysix percent say that alcohol abuse be about the same or bad now than five year ago percent say that drug abuse be the same or bad percent find theft to be the same or a great problem percent violation of honor code percent incident of physical violence percent suicide and suicide attempt percent vandalism percent excessive noise and disruptiveness in dormitory percent racial tensionshostilities percent lack of civility when dispute arise percent sexual harassment percent find rape or sexual assault to be the same or a great problem now than five year ago and so on
student affair staff be large
the survey of college and university president be also sadly revelatory
the president be ask to name the most important action they could take to improve campus life
the high response rate percent be code be visible and involved in campus event
the next two most favored response be accessible and act as a role model be not much different but lag by twelve and sixteen percentage point respectively
the least favored response be one that above all others require hard work and tough decision be actively involved in faculty and staff hire
only percent think such involvement to be important although nothing determine the quality and direction of a institution more than personnel decision

since college and university president seem to feel their mere totemic presence be more important than anything require them either to think or to act it be not surprising that chapter a celebrative community lay such emphasis on purely ceremonial occasion

why do the carnegie report ignore all alternative point of view and all the argument against its favorite nostrum that have be make repeatedly in the public press why do it not even deign to argue for the prescription it recommend why do it ignore much of the evidence collect in its own survey perhaps the answer be to be find in the attitude of college and university president according to whom it be of no great importance to ensure open discussion of campus issue to be open to divergent view or to be wellinformed about what be go on chapter a caring community seem to have be write by student affair officer for student affair officer

by thomas short
thomas short be associate professor of philosophy at kenyon college gambier oh 
alisdair macintyre entitle a recent book on ethics and political theory whose justice which rationality those question ought to be ask of teach in contemporary philosophy course
course on ethics and contemporary moral problem be popular throughout the country focus on among other thing justice
logic course if not quite so popular be also perennially full of student
whose conception of justice and which conception of rationality do these course teach
we have undertake a study of recent textbook on contemporary moral problem and on logic
we have find that overwhelmingly these book adopt a liberal to leftwing political stance
the ethics book imply that liberal or leftist have the strong argument on topic range from abortion to capital punishment to affirmative action
the logic book suggest that conservative reasoning be routinely fallacious
these finding be disturbing because while for most student one or another of these course be their first exposure to philosophy for many it be their last
at stake therefore generation will understand not only justice and rationality but philosophy itself
will student think of philosophy as a open search for truth wherever it lie or as a process of partisan debunking whose goal be to ratify contemporary ideological preference the case of logic textbook
logic seem like a paradigm of a objective apolitical discipline
despite recent trend in other area there be no such thing as specifically feminist or deconstructionist logic
there be no leftright dispute concerning logical theory
nevertheless many logic textbook reveal a bias against specific thinker and position mostly conservative one
we first begin to suspect that the teaching of logic be not immune from politics when a referee criticize a manuscript by one of us for a logic textbook not only for include too few quotation from nonwestern thinker but also for present as a example of fallacious reasoning the following quotation from m y latsis chief of lenin s secret police the cheka
we be not look for evidence or the first question we ask be to what class do he belong what be his origin upbringing education or profession these question define the fate of the accused
this be the essence of the red terror 
in just two and a half year the cheka condemn to death over fifty thousand people not because of any crime but because of their parentage education or occupation characteristic that be surely accidental to the issue of whether they deserve to die
the referee s defense of the cheka s reasoning shock us and suggest that politics may permeate logic textbook more than we have imagine
the focus of our study of logic textbook be the section most contain on informal fallacy beg the question argument ad hominem appeal to force pity emotion and the like
gerald massey and others have criticize these section for their obsession with taxonomy their lack of theory and their shoddy reasoning
certainly many treatment of fallacy do exhibit them they amount to little more than list of unrelated mistake
here however we want to focus on a different though perhaps relate shortcoming
these section to explain the general kind of fallacy and to offer student exercise give example of supposedly fallacious reasoning
we examine ten of the most commonly used introductory logic textbook contain take together almost fifteen hundred example of fallacious reasoning the book vary widely in their use of example draw from politics
in one book in our sample only percent of the example be in any way political and only percent could be construe as partisan
in another percent be political and percent be partisan
we consider a example partisan if it involve a political position often associate with a definite overall political stance
most political but nonideological example in our study involve fictional or littleknown local politician argue about each other s qualification ethics and other nonideological matter
""
the degree to which the on average percent of the example be nonpolitical and a additional percent be political but nonpartisan percent be partisan
these number be skew slightly by the highly political nature of several book
the median figure be percent percent and percent respectively
typically then about one example in four of fallacious reasoning be in some way partisan
ideological example be thus numerous enough to convey a political agenda if they display a systematic bias
be conservative reasoning fallacious reasoning
the main methodological problem in test for such bias be distinguish liberal from conservative thinker and position which if one be search for a universally applicable test be difficult
fortunately we find relatively few example in the surveyed text hard to categorize
in classify individual speaker we count richard nixon as a conservative
he be criticize in these book for many thing but never for imposing wage and price control issue a executive order authorize affirmative action or be tricky we count him as a liberal even though he be charge with fallacy almost solely because of his support for american involvement in vietnam
these two politician represent the only thinker whose position on the ideological spectrum be at all ambiguous
thus if anything we overstate the extent to which liberal thinker receive any critique at all in certain book
the number tell a discouraging tale
only one text in our sample offer a politically balanced treatment of fallacy
that be the market leader among introductory logic text copi s introduction to logic which offer a fully balanced approach criticize argument for conservative and liberal conclusion equally often
in every other text criticism of argument for conservative position outnumber those for liberal position by at least three to two and on average by three to one
the political orientation of the partisan example vary significantly but no textbook indict liberal more often than conservative
overwhelmingly the book suggest to student that fallacious reasoning be characteristic of conservative in general book in our sample indict conservative or conservative position for logical failing three time as often as they indict liberal or liberal position
it be interesting to compare the frequent criticism of conservative thinker with the treatment accord representative of extremist political position who lie outside the conventional conservativetoliberal spectrum such as hitler stalin other totalitarian and overt racist
rarely be such extremist charge with fallacy
only percent of the partisan example and just percent of the example overall be of extremist reasoning
fully half the book survey have at most one example of this kind no book have more than six
in no text have more than the median proportion of political example do those assail such extreme position comprise more than percent of the ideological example
give the continuing power of totalitarian ideology to shape world politics and the emergence of racist sentiment on campus the lack of criticism of these mode of thought be unfortunate
perhaps those responsible for these text feel it be more important expose the pseudoreasoning of racist and dictator
ungrounded criticism
these number alone however do not tell the whole story
other author have point out how some example of supposedly fallacious reasoning in logic textbook be in fact perfectly legitimate
massey for example have discuss text in which example draw from philosopher be unfairly charge with fallacy
we find that some author also evaluate argument for conservative position unfairly
some putative example of fallacious argument by conservative or for conservative position be ambiguous others be not fallacious at all
often the author seem to forget that in a textbook on logic the point at issue be not the substance of the speaker s position but the quality of his reasoning
many example of these fault be contain in howard kahane s two muchused logic textbook from which the following example be draw
example 
what persuade one person may be fallacious for another because people in different place time or circumstance have different sort of information and theory court system in the united state dispense justice equally to all on the basis of what teacher and textbook tell them may not reason fallaciously but any practicing lawyer who be nt blind who believe this have commit a horrendous error 
kahane s general principle that whether a argument be good or fallacious depend on context be surely correct
but be the example he offer to the point keep in mind that the point at issue be not whether the court system really be always just but whether particular argument for that claim be logical or not
kahane s remark come in the context of his definition of cogent and fallacious argument
have the tenyearold really be persuade by argument it seem unlikely but if so what argument without know how can we judge whether it be fallacious for either the tenyearold or the practicing lawyer a experienced lawyer who believe that the court system never make mistake be naive but have such a person commit a horrendous logical error tell what argument have convince the lawyer in sum kahane s example illustrate his point so poorly that it seem a gratuitous attack on the american legal system
example 
general alexander haig describe the watergate breakin as improper illegal and immoral a affront to the fundamental value i cherish and we all share
he also say he do nt consider the secret bombing of cambodia or the christmas bombing of north vietnam in the s to be immoral
but when ask about richard nixon s role in the watergate mess haig reply i can not bring myself to render moral judgment
that be not for me
it be not in me
i will leave that to others and to history
no one challenge him to nail down this inconsistency 
this be a good example of a ambiguous argument to which kahane ascribe a very debatable interpretation
if haig mean that he never make moral judgment then what he say be false and kahane s charge of inconsistency be then legitimate
but while haig interpretation be notoriously difficult in this context it seem likely that haig be say he can not make moral judgment about nixon s role
if that be indeed what haig mean then he be at least logically consistent whatever one s opinion of nixon
there be nothing wrong logically or otherwise with make moral judgment on some topic and withhold them on others
example 
henry w block of h xxr block the large income tax preparation company argue fallaciously in a statement against a proposal to simplify federal income tax law for example to eliminate deduction
there be nothing simple about tax and never will be
behind the seductive rhetoric of one tax structure for all be pitfall that would literally destroy the basic principle of everyone pay a fair share
block know very well as every taxpayer should that the principle of everyone pay a fair share of tax have long
he suppress this information because a simplified tax law would be a disaster for his business
again those with little relevant background knowledge be fair game 
once again the issue be not the merit of tax simplification but whether block s argument be illogical
it simply be not
block do not assume that everyone now pay a fair share of tax but that this principle be a important regulative ideal
he be argue that fairness require complexity not that our current system be perfect
in fact it be kahane not block who commit a string of logical fallacy in this example
in painting block as a pollyanna who believe that the current tax system be always fair kahane set up a straw man
far reject block s argument on the ground that block stand to profit from tax complexity be a classic instance of a fallacy usually term a circumstantial ad hominem
block s personal and financial circumstance be irrelevant to evaluate his argument as virtually every finally kahane also seem guilty of what be call ad hominem abusive he insinuate that block have suppress this information that is the obscure information that the tax system be sometimes unfair in order to take advantage of those with little relevant background knowledge
once again these charge even if true be irrelevant to the logic of block s case
indeed kahane s charge be not just irrelevant but silly who do not know that the tax code be sometimes unfair or what h xxr block be once again kahane s criticism be so off the mark that lodge a insinuation against a business interest seem to be their only goal
in the following example kahane s book reproduce a fullpage quotation from a abortion pastoral by cardinal cooke with its key phrase about abortion cross out and reference to the vietnam war handwritten in to replace them
kahane then comment as follow
example 
selective use of principle constitute a kind sic argue against abortion on the ground that it be a attack on human life
but the cardinal do not argue against the vietnam war on these ground even though it too be a attack on human life 
let us skip over such obvious point as that the cardinal may have refrain from criticize the vietnam war not out of inconsistency but for various prudential reason and address kahane s criticism of the cardinal s logic
kahane s point which be that as a matter of logic abortion and the war in vietnam be morally comparable and that he who object to one must logically object to the other be incorrect
the thesis that abortion and the vietnam war be morally equivalent be morally substantive
that is it be not a matter of pure logic and would require a great deal of specifically moral argument to establish especially since the circumstantial difference between abortion and the vietnam war be enormous
moreover even if such a conclusion could be establish it nothing he say contradict it or would be show irrelevant by it
kahane might respond that his crossouts show that the cardinal s argument apply to the war just as well as to abortion
but kahane change by the abortion law of new york state have alienate what the declaration of independence call the inalienable right to life to read by the war in vietnam the united state have alienate what the declaration of independence call the inalienable right to life
there be simply no logical fallacy in believe the cardinal s statement be true but kahane s amended version be false whatever one s position on these two contentious issue
once again it be kahane not his chosen target who commit the logical error
first not only do the selective use of principle not constitute a kind of inconsistency but to suggest so be itself a fallacy commonly call accident or misapplication
what be fallacious be to apply principle unselectively
a common example be plato s question in the republic should you return a borrowed weapon to its owner even if he or she request it in a fit of rage and plan to use it to commit a murder although we should in general keep our promise it be fallacious to argue from that principle alone to the conclusion that we should return the weapon
this suggest that selective application of principle far from constitute a fallacy be require to avoid fallacy
kahane himself acknowledge this truth in another part of his text thus leave him in the position of argue that selective application of principle be fallacious and that unselective application be also fallacious
the problem here be not kahane s implicit criticism of the prolife position or the vietnam war it be that in strain to criticize the cardinal s reasoning kahane commit a string of fallacy of his own and this in a textbook on logic
after such a performance we can not resist a ad hominem clear that he oppose the vietnam war but not roe xxv wade
presumably he do nt subscribe to the thesis of moral equivalence either
kahane s book be admittedly a extreme case
in the matter of fallacy he accuse conservative over liberal by a ratio of more than five to one and his text be by far the most political in our sample
they be nevertheless widely use
furthermore most other book we examine suffer from more or less of the same problem
quite independent of what one s political sympathy may be such bias be objectionable on a host of pedagogical ground especially when it drive author to commit the very error of reason that their own text be supposed to correct
ideology and agenda
textbook in contemporary moral problem have a similar anticonservative bias although it manifest itself in a different way
typically these text be anthology offer small bit of moral theory together with article on various contemporary concern such as abortion euthanasia affirmative action obligation the issue that appear most often in our sample 
what strike one first about these book be that they overlap very extensively they mostly treat the same issue and include many of the same reading on those issue
in general the issue focus on be political issue which itself represent a particular understanding of moral reasoning one which as christina hoff sommers have note suggest that morality be a matter of support the right cause and vote for the right people but our interest here be with the kind of political issue that be consider in these text
some of the issue most frequently consider in the text we examine such as abortion euthanasia affirmative action and capital punishment occupy the attention of people at many point on the political spectrum
but consider the other issue that often appear in order of frequency of appearance obligation to the hungry nuclear deterrence censorship extramarital sex animal right income redistribution enforce private morality feminism pacifism and homosexuality
to see how unrepresentative the above issue be consider some of the issue prominent in the public debate of the last two decade all of which have a significant moral component that do not appear on the list buse confrontation versus detente in foreign policy crime drug education family issue human right versus realpolitik middle east conflict school prayer subsidy taxation trade policy and welfare policy
the selection of issue undoubtedly reflect a desire to avoid messy empirical dispute in economics and other unphilosophical topic
but then again many of the frequently choose issue such as income redistribution or nuclear deterrence raise similar problem
apparently those responsible for the text we review be more comfortable with examine a liberal agenda and prefer not to discuss other concern
the most word and the last word
but beyond examine the character of issue that get a hearing we try to measure whether the liberal and conservative position on each the main research challenge be decide objectively what position count as either liberal or conservative but again in this context there be less to the matter than meet the eye
as we mention almost all of the most popular issue be hot political issue with partisan clearly array themselves in characteristic position
interpret and classify the contribution to these text thus present no real problem 
a slim majority of presentation on particular issue percent be balance
however a very significant percentage of presentation percent offer more liberal than conservative voice
by contrast fewer than percent give a majority to the conservative
a great number percent give only liberal voice
examine this book by book percent give liberal a majority on at least some issue only percent give conservative a majority on any issue
seventyfive percent of the book give liberal a majority on a substantial number of issue
the political orientation of these text present on each issue
who get the last word the last article in each section have a special rhetorical position the editor suggest implicitly and sometimes explicitly that it tie thing together and present that most sophisticated view of the topic
overwhelmingly we find the article in that position advance a liberal view
liberal get the last word percent of the time overall percent of the book survey give the liberal the last word a majority of the time
in fact percent give liberal the last word at least percent of the time and percent do so over percent of the time
one text give liberal the last word in every instance another do so on every issue but one
these figure show that many contemporary moral issue text be politically biased favor liberal view over their conservative competitor
but a more varied and more interesting picture emerge when the text be analyzed issuebyissue
first we consider how many voice the no issue do the book give conservative a majority more often than they give liberal a majority
table which list the issue in descending order of frequency in the text show the pattern of majority issuebyissue
note that treatment of feminism and homosexuality invariably give liberal a majority most treatment of abortion civil disobedience and enforce private morality do the same
liberal enjoy a majority in at least percent of treatment of all other issue with the exception of extramarital sex capital punishment and censorship
thus on percent of the issue at least onefourth of the textbook give liberal a majority
the comparable figure for conservative be percent
""
look again at who get the last word table the result be more dramatic
liberal get the last word at least percent of the time on almost half the issue
they get the last word every time on extramarital sex enforce private morality feminism terrorism and homosexuality deterrence and pacifism do conservative get the last word even percent of the time
these two test of bias majority and the last word give different result with respect to some issue but on a substantial number they agree
we can get a more complete picture of how balance the presentation of moral issue be in these test if we combine our two test
let us assume that a issue receive a onesided treatment if one side get the last word on it at least percent of the time and the difference between the percentage of text give that side a majority and those give the other side a majority be at least percent
use these criteria percent of the issue receive a onesided treatment
in each case the one side present be the liberal side
the issue receive a onesided liberal slant by both our criteria be abortion obligation to the hungry animal right income redistribution enforce private morality feminism social homosexuality
perhaps not surprisingly the bias be greatest among those issue less frequently treat
some of this may result from the decrease in sample size for those issue
but some of it surely reflect the place of those issue in a political agenda
despite the clear story the number tell it be hard to feel the strength of the bias in these text on the evidence of statistics alone
consider that every text raise the issue of terrorism give the last word to someone defend terrorism half also give the defender of terrorism a majority
or consider this section on sexual morality from one of our surveyed text preformatted table
after the reading from the vatican declaration which presuppose a specifically catholic religious commitment the only form of sexual activity condemn by any author be rape
unfortunately as other statistics indicate this kind of onesided treatment be not unusual
the ethics of ethics
the statistics we have present here do suggest a real unfairness in philosophy text and no doubt conservative be deny equal air time
but the deep point here be not just about make sure that yet another interest group get its fair share
contemporary moral problem present in anthology and logic textbook reflect a deeply disturbing view that go beyond any particular political opinion
the preponderance of author and editor seem to think that reason establish the truth of liberalism that correlatively conservative view result largely from shoddy reasoning
conservative opinion be implicitly or explicitly label unreasonable
the textbook suggest that anyone who think properly about the issue will reach liberal in some case it seem fair to say radical conclusion
to teach student that be to convey a unfortunate message indeed
for it deny that rational people can reason correctly about many difficult moral and political issue and still reach different conclusion
it deny that we can make progress on such issue by reason cooperatively together
and by fail to distinguish between logical and political consideration it discourage student from develop a critical distance on their own conviction
it disadvantage a certain body of opinion but because it betray the goal of both rationality and justice 
man born to freedom be naturally alert to repel invasion of liberty by evilminded ruler
the greatest danger to liberty lurk in the insidious encroachment by the man of zeal wellmeaning but without understanding
louis d brandeis
jean philippe rushton hold a research professorship in psychology at the university of western ontario
his main interest and the bulk of his work focus on the phenomenon of altruism
recently a guggenheim fellow he have also be elect a fellow of the american association for the advancement of science aaas
philippe rushton have serve as consultant to the royal commission on violence in the communication industry as a fellow of the center for advanced study in the behavioral science at stanford university as a visiting scholar at the institute of human development in berkeley and as a fellow of the social science and humanities research council of canada
moreover he be the author or coauthor of book and article or book chapter
on february rushton add one the former premier of ontario denounce his work as highly questionable destructive and offensive to the way ontario think and call for his dismissal from the university on february the toronto star a leading canadian paper suggest that rushton be a fraud or inept or both label as nazi the pioneer fund which support some of rushton s work and condemn as racist the mankind quarterly a journal in which rushton have publish a single article a month later the star carry a editorial about rushton entitle a weak response to academic fraud along with a cartoon depict him in a ku klux klan hood
shortly thereafter in that paper s easter sunday editorial the holocaust and the antichrist be link to a academic at a ontario university
to add to this storm of damn criticism the dean of social science at the university of western ontario emoke szathmary declare that rushton have lose his scientific credibility 
but more ontario provincial police launch a investigation of rushton question other professor at the university of western ontario demand tape of rushton s debate and media appearance and later send a questionnaire about his research to rushton s attorney to which rushton be oblige to reply in detail ontario attorney general lan scott ultimately decline to prosecute rushton criminally contenting himself with a public denunciation of rushton s theory as loony
 nevertheless not since the day of joseph mccarthy have a north american s opinion lead to such violent criticism nor leave him so close to criminal prosecution
what then have philippe rushton do to inspire this outrage on the part of the press government official and the police rushton s talk
on january rushton have read a twentyminute paper at the aaas meet in san francisco during a symposium entitle evolutionary theory economics and political science
in this talk and in several other paper he examine data on some sixty variable report in the group negroids caucasoids and oriental
the data examine include such trait as average brain size performance on standardized test evaluation of personality and temperament social behavior speed of maturation sexual habit and fertility
he reach the conclusion that the data cluster in such a way that the racial group could be order according to average variation in these trait
negroids be on average more fertile fast maturing more sexually active and less accomplish in standardized test than oriental who tend to the opposite in each trait
caucasoids regularly fall between the two other racial group
rushton then hypothesize that the ordering correspond to what be familiar to population biologist as the rk scale of reproductive strategy
at one end of this scale be rstrategies which emphasize high reproductive rate and at the other kstrategies which emphasize high level of parental investment nurturing
the scale be generally use to compare what be often widely disparate species but the human species
the more k the family the great should be the spacing between birth the fewer the number of offspring the low the rate of infant mortality the more stable the family system and the better develop the parental care
the more k the person the long should be the period of gestation the high the birthweight the more delay the onset of sexual activity the old the age at first reproduction the long the life the more psychologically efficient the use of energy the high the intelligence the more social rulefollowing the behavior and the great the altruism
thus diverse organismic characteristic not otherwise relatable be presume to covary along a single dimension
because the race differ on many of the k characteristic rushton hypothesize that oriental be more k selected than caucasoids who in turn be more k selected than negroids
thus he argue the posited racial difference in behavior may belong in a broad evolutionary context than have rk scale of reproductive strategy on to human evolution
base on work by e o wilson and john bonner among others as well as on study of genetic distancing draw from the analysis of dna sequencing by stringer and andrews he suggest that group that be more kselected in their reproduction strategy emerge later in the evolutionary process than group that be less kselected
rushton hypothesize that archaic version of the three population we call race emerge from the ancestral hominid line in the following order negroids about year ago caucasoids about year ago and oriental about year ago
such a ordering rushton argue fit with and explain the way in which the variable he study be find to cluster among human negroids the early to emerge be least kselected caucasoids emerge later be next least kselected and oriental emerging late be the most kselected
of course rushton do not claim to have establish his contentious hypothesis
they may never be them be eventually confirm they would provide a very powerful explanation of why on average the measured trait distribute themselves among racial group as they do
the resulting theory would provide a evolutionary explanation of many gross behavioral trait thus achieve two fundamental goal of any science to provide causal explanation of phenomenon and to unify separate field
these be powerful incentive for theory make and have historically drive the work of the best scientist
the issue of racism
the dilemma rushton s case seem to pose for anyone with a decent regard for both racial justice and free intellectual inquiry be manifold
even assume that rushton have a absolute right to academic freedom many question need to be ask about him his theory and his critic
one may inquire for example whether such seemingly odd speculation can possibly be the product of competent scholarship or whether if so they be morally defensible
so far almost all the criticism have be level on normative and political ground attempt hope to demonstrate here that they be neither and more generally that academic case of what seem to be genuinely racist theorizing be best deal with by subject them to rigorous scientific debate and review rather than through the application of political or legal pressure
i believe that the fact will also show that while the validity of rushton s conjecture be very far from have be demonstrate his work constitute a legitimate exercise by a competent scholar and do not deserve the abusive treatment it have receive
but before we consider rushton s work on scholarly ground we have to confront headon whether it be racist on its face
the essence of racism lie in the belief that people of a certain racial group should be accord less respect or fewer right than be give others solely because of their race
by this clear test nothing rushton say be racist
to begin with rushton go out of his way to emphasize that since there will be great difference among individual in each population group impossible to draw soundly even in principle
here he part company entirely with those theorist who argue that race be the best available predictor of a individual s intelligence or character
rushton be perfectly clear that his be not a theory of individual variation
it must be emphasize that there be enormous variability within each population
since the distribution overlap it be always problematic to generalize from a group average to any particular individual recall that only of the variance be genetic on his hypothesis and that be due to the environment
even the genetic effect be necessarily mediate by neuroendocrine and psychosocial mechanism 
at the level of the individual it must be recognize that almost all will have a mixture of xxr and k characteristic 
it be also crucial that rushton do not claim his hypothesis generate any social legal or political policy
indeed he say nothing about policy or politics at all
if rushton argue that on the basis of his hypothesis black should be discriminate against of racism
but he say no such thing
this bring us to the question of the validity of rushton s thesis and his scholarly competence regarding the validity of the hypothesis the fact be that no one neither rushton nor his critic know for certain whether it be true or not but and this be a crucial point a scholar need not establish the truth of his theory before he have a right to express and disseminate them
the point ought to be obvious for several reason
first of all even truth now universally accepted such as heliocentrism be uncertain and sometimes highly controversial when new
thus if academic freedom be reserve only for the propagation of unquestioned or even likely truth scientific and scholarly inquiry would come to a halt
in fact as everyone with experience in the academy well know scholar work on subject less controversial than race may propagate opinion that be not only obviously untrue but positively ludicrous without have their academic freedom to be of this type he have as much right to express them and as much a claim to civil treatment as do provocative eccentric or merely unorthodox scholar work in other field
the proper intellectual standard to apply in case such as this where the issue be whether academic freedom and civility be due ought not to be be this work absolutely true but rather be this work the product of competent scholarship just as physician and lawyer be properly censure or even deprive of their professional status not when wrong but only when clearly inept so too censure of rushton would be merit only if his theory be the product of incompetent scholarship
moreover the dismissal of a respected and tenured researcher could only be justify upon a showing of failure of competence in many line of his work 
rushton and others have discuss many of the objection to his theory including the following the correlation between many of the variable old and poorly ascertain at least some of the correlation may be explain by environmental factor there be mammalian species that do not fit the projected pattern both human sexual more and achieve fertility be notably variable feature fertility itself be not know to be heritable and the data on dna sequencing upon which rushton rely may be incorrect
naturally rushton believe he have sufficient answer to the objection
whether this be true or not however can not be our concern
that have to be leave to a scientific consensus that will emerge from the research publish in refereed journal
the question rather be whether rushton be honestly try to respond to such objection and be display adequate scholarly competence in do so
in this connection it be only fair to mention that all of rushton s work have be find convincing enough not merely to merit publication in refereed journal but to gain for him those distinction mention above
what be more he have develop his theory and respond to scientific criticism in a manner befit the scholar he be
however controversial or incorrect his idea may turn out to be they be simply not the product of a intellectual incompetent or a racist
despite this rushton s competence continue to be the target of many attack none of them convincing
in the january issue of the toronto star under the subhead race superiority theory pure hokum scientist say reporter lynda hurst challenge rushton s scholarship on the ground that his assumption about the relative dating of the emergence of the race be base on a article reporting dna sequence finding publish in a supposedly popular unscholarly journal science
hurst record a university of western ontario geneticist joseph cummins as say that contrary data would be forthcoming in the january issue of a professional publication the american journal of human genetics
unwary reader might be expect to miss the fact that this data would appear after rushton s talk and well they conflict with the science artide it would have be impossible for rushton to have take them into account
moreover science the official weekly of the aaas be in fact a highly regard and fully referee journal
the implication that data publish in this journal be less reliable than data publish elsewhere be false
some commentator have brand rushton a incompetent because many of the scientist whose data he use disagree with his interpretation of their work but scientist who gather data be not the final arbitrator on the interpretation of those data
rushton take his data as he find it in the literature
copernicus who do not make his own observation do the same when he take his data from his ancient predecessor ptolemy which he then use to overturn ptolemy s geocentric theory of the solar system
rushton be simply in disagreement with many of his datagathering scientific colleague and such disagreement be not a sign of intellectual failure
write in mill put the case for liberty
we can never be sure the opinion we be endeavor to stifle be a false opinion and if we be sure stifle it would be a evil still those who desire to suppress it of course deny its truth but they be not infallible
they have no authority to decide the question for all mankind to refuse a hearing to a opinion because they be sure it be false be to assume that their certainty be the same as absolute certainty
all silencing of discussion be a assumption of infallibility
only through free speech could one reach even provisional truth
and it be clear to mill as it should be to us that truth be a good and desirable thing especially in the university
there be no other raison detre for the life of the mind
and there can be no life of the mind without free inquiry into truth
there be another reason for free speech which mill do not consider quis custodiet ipsos custodes who can be for what reason we have too much experience with censorship to entrust such power to anyone
this remedy have always prove far bad than any alleged disease it be supposed to cure
mill famously think he find a natural limit to free speech the point at which it cause palpable harm
his example show he take that point to be roughly where american law for the most part today draw the line at the point where speech become action in conspiracy or incitement or in case such as libel where the speech itself create clear direct or measurable damage
now the university be the place of all place where truth be seek
but truth be neither always recognize as mill note nor always palatable
it often offend
as huxley say with only some overstatement every scientific truth begin as heresy
academic freedom and freedom of speech be empty concept if they be hold to protect only speech that be acceptable to most people
such speech need no protection
only that because that be the only speech censor wish to suppress
it be precisely such speech that academic freedom be design to protect
now speech in pursuit of scientific scholarly or philosophic truth be hardly likely to contribute either to conspiracy or incitement
if the university be to have any real task such speech must remain free
realize this john dewey and a o lovejoy found the american association of university professor and fight for the establishment of academic freedom and tenure
no one in the academy ought to have to fear voice controversial or unpopular view
no one ought to be at risk for his idea
dewey s influential student the late sidney hook define academic freedom as the freedom of professional qualified person to inquire discover publish and teach the truth as they see it in the field of their choice without any control or authority except the control or authority of the rational method by which truth can be established 
the condition of appointment of the university of western ontario
the essential function of a university be the pursuit creation and dissemination of knowledge through research and other scholarly activity and by teaching
these can not be perform without academic freedom which ensure the right of every faculty member regardless of rank or status to teach investigate and speculate without deference to prescribed doctrine
just so
and the model clause on academic freedom of the canadian association of university teacher state its principle thus
the common good of society depend upon the search for knowledge and its free exposition
academic freedom in university be essential to both these purpose in the teaching function of the university as well as in scholarship and research
academic staff shall not be hinder or impede in any way by the university or the faculty association from exercise their right as citizen nor shall they suffer any penalty because of the exercise of such legal right
the party agree that they will not infringe or abridge the academic freedom of any member of the academic community
academic doctrine to freedom in carry out research and in publish the result thereof freedom of teaching and of discussion freedom to criticize the university and the faculty association and freedom from institutional censorship
academic freedom do not require neutrality on the part of the individual
rather academic freedom make commitment possible
academic freedom carry with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research and teach in a honest search for knowledge
finally the canadian constitution act of contain a canadian charter of right and freedom
section read
fundamental freedom
everyone have the following fundamental freedom
a freedom of conscience and religion
b freedom of thought belief opinion and expression including freedom of the press and other media of communication
c freedom of peaceful assembly and
d freedom of association
under these three admirable canadian document philippe rushton should have be leave free to promulgate his view given that rushton s scholarly standing be in good order what do the whole episode say about the state of academic freedom in canada and perhaps more generally first consider the shocking fact that rushton have be the subject of a lengthy inquiry not by his scholarly peer alone but by the police
the ontario provincial police conduct a sixmonth investigation of rushton seek to determine whether he have violate the federal criminal code of canada chapter c paragraph which read in its relevant part every one who by communicating statement other than private conversation willfully promote hatred against any identifiable group be guilty of a a indictable offense and be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceed two year emphasis add
after a detailed examination of his evidence originality qualification method and so forth the distinguished scholar of the provincial police come to the considered conclusion that it be the overwhelming opinion of academic question that misinterpreted andor questionable source data
this have resuited in your presentation to the aaa sic fall noticeably short of expected professional standard
 in sum the provincial police officially assess the question of whether rushton might be subject to two year in prison for such action as use questionable source data and then very graciously hold that while incompetent his work do not constitute a federal offense
even supposing the dark interpretation of rushton s work be true can anyone with the slight respect for academic or intellectual freedom assume that a police investigation and the possibility of imprisonment constitute acceptable response if academic freedom mean anything it must at least mean freedom from prosecution
yet in rushton s case even this most elemental standard have be violate in the name of antiracism
only slightly less destructive of the ideal of academic freedom have be the action of the university of western ontario which have give rushton a formal negative evaluation deprive him of a usually pro forma pay increase and take
at the university of western ontario even tenure full professor be evaluate annually to determine among other thing pay increase and promotions a committee of seven member of the department of psychology judge rushton unsatisfactory for 
the committee write to rushton that his unacceptable scholarly performance in race difference outweigh your obvious productivity and the commendable character of other work
should rushton receive three such unsatisfactory rating in a row his tenure would be revoke
in any case he be deprive of a considerable chunk of his salary increase
the university of western ontario also launch two separate investigation into the ethics of rushton s experiment with student both on and off campus and manage to convict him of minor breach
the university also threaten to monitor his class begin with the fall semester 
it be important to note that the committee s action despite its abovequoted statement appear to be base not on rushton s scholarship but on dislike of rushton s theory on racial difference
the committee inadequate
in any case even if that work have be show faulty there be enough other work more than percent of his output for that year devote to other subject
indeed in rushton have be award a prestigious guggenheim fellowship and have more scholarly entry on his annual report than any other member of his department
one british colleague write that rushton annually have more research publish in high quality journal than many entire british psychology department give such a record of scholarly accomplishment can it possibly have be fair to take such severe step because of the publication of a highly controversial theory again if academic freedom afford any protection it surely must protect a obviously able scholar from official censure for simple controversy
even the procedure use to judge rushton do not seem quite fair
dean szathmary deny rushton s appeal from his departmental rating of unsatisfactory
but she have already declare publicly that he have no scientific credibility leave
moreover member of his departmental first appeal which they then go on to deny all of them ought to have recuse themselves none do
in correspondence dean szathmary seek to defend her action with the novel claim that her remark on rushton s scientific credibility be make in her professional capacity but her denial of his appeal be make in her entirely different capacity as dean presumably suitably insulate from professional contamination prosecutor and judge in one 
in addition rushton s department be attempt to require him to teach his large lecture section this fall on videotape which be again a denial of his academic freedom apart from the unacceptability of such a requirement rushton will be deprive of his teaching assistant for grade because she will be need to meet preceptorially with his student after his videotaped lecture
the politics of scholarship on race
on the basis of his scholarly competence and right to academic freedom philippe rushton should have be leave free to promulgate his view without obstruction subject only to genuine scientific criticism
but he call upon in public to defend not merely his idea but his personal and professional integrity
he have be denounce on national television to his face as a neonazi
his graduate student have be advise to seek other mentor
colleague who have not read his work abuse him
collaborator have request the withdrawal of their name from article already in press and which have nothing to do with the subject of hypothetical race difference
what idea of justice and civility can legitimate a campaign against rushton of such intensity
rushton s more articulate critic justify their tactic as follow
first they claim that the theory be not true and that academic freedom only protect the truth but we have already consider this argument and only add now that such a standard would even have fail to protect galileo against the inquisition for strictly speak his theory be false as be all the leading astronomical theory of the time
second as david suzuki a geneticist and broadcaster associate with the televised debate with rushton in a society in which racism be rampant it be not sufficient for a scientist to say i be merely give you truth
suzuki s doctrine be more subtle and so more dangerous
in what sense be it not sufficient for a scientist to give the truth as he see it can the truth or even a honest effort to approximate the truth be somehow harmful or racist as suzuki s statement seem to imply obviously scientific idea as idea can hardly be harmful in themselves and it be sheer hyperbole to call a scientific theory racist
nor do the lamentable fact that racism continue to exist require scientist as scientist to scrutinize their finding for whether they offend against this or that political ideology
scientist of course can not guarantee their work will never be use for evil that be a task society as a whole must undertake
and in fact society be move though perhaps too slowly against racism
not when rule and oppression be most severe but rather when thing be get better
there be certainly more than a little irony that in a era when race problem have be openly acknowledge and race relation have greatly improve at least in the western world we be inform that racism be so rampant that scientist must practice selfcensorship
once it be north american liberal and leftist who fight honorably for the principle of free speech and academic freedom
now all that have change
as the rushton case illustrate most leftist and too many who call themselves liberal seek to punish those whose speech offend them
for such person free speech and academic freedom be no long question of principle everything be merely a matter of whose ox be gore
they would do themselves well to rediscover the meaning of traditional liberal ideal before the climate of opinion change and they be on the receiving end of a witch hunt such as rushton have experienced 
on april the new york time report that dr joel segall president of baruch college of the city university of new york be resign from his job follow a critical review by the middle state association of school and college
there be no allegation that baruch be anything less than a excellent college
in fact it be widely regard as one of the four top business college in the country and train almost one out of every three of the certified public accountant work in new york
rather the complaint be that there be not enough minority in the faculty and administration and that not enough minority graduate
disturbing though this be even more unsettling be the fact that the criticism be concoct by the central office of the accrediting agency act independently of its own guideline and evaluation team
while it contain some criticism of baruch s curriculum the public report issue by the evaluation team itself be on the whole quite positive
the mention ethnic tension and the lack of minority on the faculty
the report do not state that accreditation be to be withhold or deferred because of these matter
according to procedure commonly follow in accreditation baruch be give a opportunity to submit a statement answer the criticism in the team s report
follow the college s response a still confidential letter from sarah blandshei the chair of the middle state association be say to have indicate that accreditation would be defer because of the minority attrition rate and the lack of minority in the administration and faculty
dr howard l simmons executive director of the middle state association acknowledge that under his leadership the agency have undertake a new activist role
he have assert according to a recent issue of black issue in high education that all university must be make responsible for the success of minority in high education in order to do this simmons say in a interview the faculty and administration the student body
 this be part of a broad initiative by simmons
according to published report fifteen to twenty other institution have also be threaten on these ground by the association baruch s be only the first case to become public
the attack on segall and the baruch faculty represent a ominous direction take by accreditation
for the first time a accrediting agency be criticize the ethnic composition of a college s graduate class as well as make specific complaint about the racial makeup of its faculty and staff
according to a source on the department of education s national advisory committee on accreditation and institutional eligibility such a step be entirely unprecedented
no other accrediting agency have ever undertake a aggressive role in attempt to impose racial quota on faculty administrator and graduate
in itself the attempt to control the ethnicity of university personnel be nothing new
in the last twenty year the concept of affirmative action have evolve into a quota system in which white male be routinely article in the american scholar although deeply threaten to the integrity of the university because they undermine the concept of professional peer review quota impose on personnel committee have be a long time aborning and it do not appear that they will be easily abolish
until recently however the federal government be the principal agency in this coercion
now it appear the effort have shift from government to private agency such as middle state accompany by the notion that henceforth a college may have its accreditation withhold if it do not graduate the right percentage of certain ethnic group
a racial graduation quota
when ask if a college could be find delinquent for fail to graduate sufficient number of minority student simmons agree that middle state do use a outcomesbased approach for grant or withhold its approval
he deny that middle state have any hard and fast rule regarding minority retention rate indicate there be never a single standard in assess a school s performance in this from characteristic of excellence in high education standard for accreditation the handbook use by middle state
in fact there be no statement whatsoever in that manual concerning minority retention rate
when this be point out simmons change his mind and say that accreditation be grant or withhold on a casebycase basis
i know that sound hard to understand he admit but that be how they do it
the team decide differently for each school
there be so many factor involve that there can be no quantitative standard for evaluate a college
so much for the objective criteria of accreditation
what be particularly bizarre about simmon s line of reasoning be the fact that student at baruch regardless of racial and ethnic identity generally have a much better chance of graduate than elsewhere
of white freshman at baruch percent graduate in four year compare to a national average of percent percent of black freshman graduate in four year compare to graduate in four year compare to percent nationwide only hispanic a particularly heterogeneous group whose actual composition vary greatly by region do slightly less well percent at baruch and percent nationwide
""
apparently not only have the criteria for minority retention be invent for the occasion by middle state headquarters but the true number have be ignore
it be likely that the criteria be keep deliberately vague in order to increase the arbitrary power of the accreditors
the use of a unstated but de facto racial graduation quota put university administrator in a vulnerable position since there be no way to tell whether middle state will charge them with not have satisfy the goal of graduate sufficient number of designated minority group
the lack of precision permit middle state to deny that they be seek any exact outcome thereby avoid legal action
at the same time when it suit them they can use the outcomesbased approach as a potential threat to college seek accreditation
real racial graduation quota resident and dean will be inclined to design program to increase graduation prospect for protected group
middle state can thus obtain the desired outcome without ever have to invoke the threat explicitly and all the while remain protect from public scrutiny
simmons admit have adopt the same tactic with many other institution but because of the secrecy involved in the accreditation process he have not have to be hold publicly accountable
however in this he may have violate federal regulation
the department of education have criteria for recognition of accredit agency one being that a agency not mislead the public regarding a institution s or program s educational effectiveness
 can white teach black and vice versa
the other criticism level against baruch be that be do not employ enough minority
in reality this argument be absurd since many baruch professor be jewish and nonwhite asian
but in educationspeak such individual be not define as minority
middle state nonhispanic white and not enough black for a student body that include many black and hispanic
thus the broad question at issue be whether or not white instructor can adequately teach minority student
the diversity of a student body according to middle state must be match by a corresponding diversity of faculty and administrator
this belief be so widespread amongst academic administrative cognoscenti that few question it
when the logic of such a concept be challenge the usual response be that a white professor can not be as good a role model for a black student as a black professor
in fact there be little or no systematic evidence for this argument
in social psychology the notion of role model be correctly apply to the basic socialization of child when explain how in childhood we identify with others particularly parent sibling and peer and choose certain person particularly those of the same sex on whom to model ourselves
may be as likely to deidentify or want to be the opposite of a peer or a sibling or a parent
it be also highly questionable whether this process take place after puberty
at most therefore while one may suggest that professor can serve as inspirational mentor to college student no evidence exist that such individual must be of the same sex race or cultural background
the idea of role model in short be fraudulently apply in the field of high education
indeed if such a concept do make sense it would have exactly the opposite result of what middle state ostensibly desire
it would mean not only that black student should be counsel to take course only from black professor but also that white student should not take course from black professor
if black student need black professor as role model to spur them to great level of achievement white student require and deserve the same kind of encouragement
take to its logical conclusion the racial segregation in high education
if black student respond best to black professor they ought to maximize their chance by enroll at allblack college
the same would apply mutatis mutandis to white student
another justification for the use of racial quota in hiring be the suggestion that white professor be somehow hard on black student
as closet or unconscious racist white faculty be according to this argument responsible for the high dropout rate of black
in point of fact there be no evidence for great white professorial bias against black student
dr june oneill a former member of the united state commission on civil right and professor at baruch s center for business and government have do extensive research on the determinant of black and white high school student achievement when they be young adult
black student who have black teacher tend to do less well in terms of verbal aptitude but this be because black faculty tend to be less well prepare
by itself a teacher s it be doubtful however that simmons and his ally be inspire by evidence or logic
there be no reason to believe that much reflection be do on the scientific basis for their criticism and suggestion
rather than call for measure that will actually improve the quality of education at the institution they investigate they seek symbolic move that produce positive media image
future implication of accreditation quota
in the classic accreditation process institution be evaluate on the basis of the stringency or laxity of their educational standard
in the past if a college be find to be too lax accreditation be withhold or perhaps conditionally grant pending correction of certain deficiency
but now for the first time a college s accreditation have be defer not because its standard be too low but because they be too high
a institution of high learning be be direct to arrange its faculty administration and curriculum so that a de facto racial graduation quota can be fill
aside from some serious issue the abolition of institutional autonomy and faculty control over the hiring process
it be no coincidence that this new and arbitrary direction have be take by a private accrediting agency
in the supreme court issue a series of decision that seriously undermine the ability of government to require institution to use racial and sexual quota in hire and promotion
though this be a serious setback for those who would like to see a political system govern by racial and sexual entitlement they have evidently regroup
for example under the sponsorship of senator kennedy and hawkins the civil right bill of currently be argue in congress would reimpose on employer the burden of prove that they do not discriminate against minority in hiring
since it be virtually impossible to prove that something have not occure the result will be that employer including college and university will be oblige to adopt quota in hiring in order to forestall potential lawsuit
this be particularly likely because the same legislation will require employer to pay the cost of employee discrimination free of charge
on the level of academic rhetoric the tactic have be to substitute diversity for the nowtainted affirmative action since it be widely recognize that the latter have produce discriminatory preferential hiring
survey show that most black as well as most white be oppose to preferential treatment for black
use diversity sound better because the term be vague and it be hard to say one be against it
but the baruch case show what diversity truly mean it be simply old wine in new bottle
that there be no logical or empirical justification for racial quota in hire or graduation should not need say
but simmons and his ally be not govern by logic or fact they be drive by a sense of moral righteousness that be impervious to any argument
rather than conform to consistent and objective standard of excellence simmons make up the rule as he go along
rather than appeal to the intellect simmons tug at people s base education
recently i read a fine article by professor walter berns call the core as a education for natural aristocrat see academic question summer 
it be a jeffersonian idea and i agree with it but for some reason i find that i spend much more time worry about that oxymoron the natural bourgeoisie than about any kind of aristocracy natural or conventional
it be true that student at liberal art college even in ohio have a kind of aristocratic assurance that their life will be successful and that they will do important thing in the world
also they tend to enjoy something of the highminded innocence of the wellreared and protect which encourage them to love learn for its own sake rather than for material utility
but to belabor the obvious above all they be creature of liberal democracy and as such irredeemably bourgeois
they pretend to be relativist but be really believer in right and individual responsibility
underneath the hightoned moralism the life they will lead when they graduate will overwhelmingly be bourgeois life compose of the usual professional and commercial career condominium divorce therapy and retirement
of course not only do liberal educator know this but on the whole it drive them wild
as we all know by and large liberal art professor belong to that strain of the bourgeoisie which dislike itself hence the really powerful intellectual movement on contemporary campus be all characterize by bourgeoisbashing
what hold humanistic ie aesthetic nietzschean marxism together be hatred of the human product of commercial republic
feminism which in the large society have strong element that be irreproachably bourgeois wage equality selffulfillment in the prestigious university be magnetize to utopian antibourgeois speculation about overcome the tyranny of gender or patriarchy
deconstruction despite and indeed because of its air of a political cool mock the square epistemological naivete of workaday life
the crusade against the dominance of western student to something really exotic and thus to destroy their bourgeois complacency
pedagogical politics be thoroughly antibourgeois whether it be engage in purify democracy of its bourgeois taint or create idealist who be to work for a better nonbourgeois and perhaps nonliberal world
yet there be something paradoxical and selfdefeating to the point of comedy in the way this all work out
to understand this one have to remember why the bourgeois get such a bad reputation in the first place
this be not selfevident
in certain passage adam smith for example glorify the honesty straightforwardness and independence of the bourgeois
where the courtly spaniel fawn and beg for a bone of patronage the manly bourgeois plunk his hardearned money down and truck for his wherewithal
there be still some student like this mostly economics major who simply can not be make to feel guilty about maximize their utility
still most of the student i see resemble the bourgeoisie rousseau denounce and moliere lampoon a bourgeoisie intimidate by aristocratic the bourgeois be a creature of city but not really a citizen just a lover of private life peace and commerce
alienate from his original human nature as a happy sappy witless beast he have not achieve a coherent second nature
that be why the natural bourgeoisie be a oxymoron the bourgeois be convention incarnate
this make him extremely nervous and he live like moliere s m jourdan according to the opinion of others
his natural selflove sour into amour propre poison by fear about his neighbor judgment of his lawn his car his politics and his soul
the vice of vanity constitute his inner life
he want to be like even if not wellliked if only someone will tell him what rule to conform to
in the end most do not go as far as m jourdan most do not try to transform themselves utterly into aristocrat or as be more typical today proletarian or bohemian
but mostly the conscience
i find that student fit the pattern pretty well
the smugness which their teacher find so exasperating be only a attitude strike for lack of a better and easily give way to selfcontempt and cynicism
last year i hear the actress jody foster recently graduate from yale interview on a morning news show
the interviewer ask ms foster if play a rape victim in a film have enable her to relive the real victim s plight
of course not come the reply to imagine that would just be bourgeois
i gather from this that ms foster have learn her lesson well at yale
she have learn that bourgeois be a synonym for philistine fake and vulgar
but do learning this make her less bourgeois she may think so but to judge by the student i see she would be wrong
contempt for the bourgeoisie be in fact a classic and unattractive bourgeois trait that today s liberal education tend merely to aggravate
frequently assume the character of a pathological passive aggressive relationship
on the surface one parmer constantly exhort denounce and edifies while the other heap ash on his head confess and grovel
really however the apparent victim in this case the student remain quite untouched absorb the critique into a preexisting pattern of selfblame and determination to resist and often succeed in revenging himself in typical passive aggressive way by constantly offer hope of reform and constantly frustrating it
real liberal education be thus twice block first by the genuine though hide resentment feel against what liberal education appear to be and second by the student delusion that they have overcome their bourgeois limitation when they have merely intensify them
of course the question rousseau raise about the bourgeois be a version of the question we be treat here
there be indeed something defective about the bourgeois as a citizen precisely because of his irony and anxiety which be inextricably attach to his privatism bourgeois waver between gesture of commitment and gesture of cynicism between burst of indignant enthusiasm for drug today against them tomorrow and retreat into passivity
the middle position between these gesture which know themselves as gesture be also do in bad faith be a moderation essentially helpless unguided by principle
argument can lead nowhere should we interfere with other government no
what about south africa that be different
should we protect freedom of speech yes
what about racist speech well
it seem to me that ever since rousseau there have be a great emerging argument in the west about how to ennoble and edify the bourgeoisie
humanist marxist socialist communitarian teacher of republican virtue and even though secretly i think the overtly unedifying literary critic be all engage in the task
of course as allan bloom have remind us liberal education always must balance against the prejudice of the regime partly for the sake of the regime but mostly may not understand itself as essentially or primarily edify
yet it seem to me that under current circumstance the argument between thought for its own sake and for political and moral edification be largely moot
this be because as far as i can tell all effort at edification be failure on their own term precisely because they be sense however dimly as effort at edification rather than real education
the contemporary version of antibourgeois moralizing fail with particularly comic aplomb because it play right into those bourgeois trait it seek to overcome
but the more serious nineteenthcentury version which have its root in german classicism s project of aesthetic education fail as well
unlike contemporary moralism which conceal itself as openmindedness the nineteenthcentury version seek to combat meanspirited anxiety directly
by hold heroic example to the bourgeois for inspection and emulation the bourgeois be supposed to become noble his vulgar taste refine his selfregarding passion generously extend
in schiller s don carlos written year before he develop the theory practice we have the classic test case
the play s apparent hero the marquis posa be a good eighteenthcentury liberal set in despotic unenlightened time
he be present as both noble and democratic a citizen of the world and a loving friend a model to the highminded young of the new more egalitarian world
but a careful reading of the play show posa to be a far more ambiguous character than his edifying appearance a bad friend and a incompetent politician motivate by vanity
the true greatness of the play depend on that more careful reading
yet schiller s intent seem to have be to allow the edifying moralize reading to be generally accept
the consequence be that the nobility of the example become unreal
posa and other schillerian hero become hollow plaster cast of classical statuary which could be fill with any political content
hence those horrible monograph one can still find in card catalog on schiller the nationalist schiller the socialist schiller the national socialist
the ennobled understand it to be a gesture devoid of content
hence in part the failure of high german culture to create a sufficiently responsible politically decent bourgeoisie a failure betoken in many old war movie by the figure of the sensitive pianoplaying german officer who still justly get shot at the end
the most edifying education that middle class american can receive it seem to me be the one that be the least overtly edify the least concerned to hector them or remake them the one that be most concerned with set out the matter of fact about themselves and the world
trivial though this suggestion may appear its implication may not be
what would such a education look like it would share with the contemporary diversity movement the goal of let student understand that their habitual custom and taste be not simply natural but a product of prior choice that they must either affirm or reject
that mean it would have to make available to them the other way
start with a polemical animus against what the student presumably be one teach a wide variety of text take out of the context of highly developed culture which be then make comprehensible by a hopelessly western if antibourgeois analysis
the result be gesture and costume
like those nobel hurons and compassionate pasha the eighteenthcentury enlightenment love so dearly the student see the other dress in exotic garb but he be really look in the mirror and all he ever see be himself
thus he think he be learn nonwestern value when in fact it be only in a particular part of the west that faith be think of as value
because he do not know himself he can not know the other and thus can not know himself through the other
add fanon to the canon in no way rescue student from the grasp of dead white european male it merely add a couple of outfit to the great historical fashion show to go with say the guitar of the alternative would be to start with the west not torment by the bizarre dogma that everyone from aristotle to augustine be really just confirm the goodness of the american status quo
there student discover version of the good human type which both distress and attract them honorloving warrior contemplationloving philosopher godfearing prophet and mystic serious warlike relativist irrationalist scientist
they come to see for themselves what they be what their life be and generally will be like
as they reflect on their own response to the argument they be face with they come to understand the bourgeois not as a historical accident or as ms foster be teach a social solecism but as the product of a very serious choice that have its strength and limitation
on this basis they can if they be willing to expend the cost in time and energy study a nonwestern culture in a serious way learn the language take its account of the good as seriously as they i suspect it will be much easy in most case to find the way to the samurai ideal from the greek gentleman describe by aristotle than from the contemporary antibourgeois bourgeois prejudice which shudder at the very notion of rank or to find the way to asian religion from a serious study of augustine than from the contemporary dogma of those who understand religion only as a manifestation of culture
""
on this basis too student can i think become better citizen of a liberal democracy
they learn how to escape from the plight of m jourdan alternate helplessly between the attitude of immense selfsatisfaction and total anxiety
it be not that they be free from irony about themselves
on the contrary their irony will be far deep because it will not have the phony salvation of progressive selfrighteousness to offer it temporary and inadequate relief
they know much better than before just how far they be from what be truly excellent
but this knowledge partly because it be knowledge their knowledge need one s own shortcoming be part of one s life one s possession and not a perpetual damnation by some unappeasable figure of authority
in those circumstance it make sense to try to change oneself from inside to approximate standard that be not merely one s own but which one have make one s own without regard to the opinion of others
this be of course what those who seek to ennoble the bourgeoisie be after it be at the heart of the kantian project that even now in scientific disguise as kohlbergian psychology heavily influence the school
but that end can not be hold up as a ideal or hypostatized into a standard
if the end be already know if we communicate however subtly that become more sensitive or a more virtuous citizen or a despiser of bourgeois vulgarity or even a autonomous moral being be the goal of education then that education degenerate into edification
only if all the card be put on the table can student and hot gospeling be constitutive of their bourgeois life emerge from the crippling irony and anxiety that be at root the same thing whether they express themselves as cynicism or dogmatism
only then can student become what they be which be a necessary step to become something better than they be as citizen as human being and yes as member of the bourgeoisie
by fred baumann
fred baumann be associate professor of political science at kenyon college gambier oh 
just a few week ago at my own college at a meeting on the curriculum a colleague of mine in anthropology remark that whatever else we may prescribe in a curriculum for the college he would argue for one requirement that our student come to understand a culture other than their own
this earnest man have be quite far from appreciate the irony of his proposal for these child the child of the american regime there be nothing so alien and unfamiliar as the doctrine of natural right that shape the understanding of the american founder
most of them have be raise in family that have identify themselves as christian or jewish and yet their conviction be quite at odds with the logic of that monotheism in which they have be raise
not too long ago i see a commentary on that story in the first book of king when elijah have lodge himself on mount horeb and he be instruct by god to journey to damascus point out that this story have be think to date from the first half of the ninth century bc and it show just how early the jew have absorb the notion of monotheism
the god who could order a local prophet to cross the border install a new king or cashier a old one be not one of those local god so familiar to antiquity
his authority be not confine to the land of israel his authority be the same in all place his jurisdiction be understand to be universal
and of course the god who be the author of the universal law of physics be also the author of moral law that be not confine to damascus or jersey city
most of our student at the most selective college and university have be raise in church and synagogue and yet they seem quite remote from this rudimentary point which be part of the logic of monotheism
anyone who know college student know that they be grip by the secular religion of cultural relativism absolute truth that there be no moral truth that preserve their truth in all place and time that notion of fight and wrong must always be relative to the country in which they be hold
the student seem quite distant too from the understanding of the nineteenyearold alexander hamilton when he remark on the root fallacy in hobbes namely that hobbes disbelieve in the existence of a intelligent superintending principle who be the governor and will be the final judge of the universe and that god have constitute a eternal and immutable law which be obligatory upon all mankind prior to any human institution whatever which be to say even before the advent of a government
that be not a idle observation it be bind up with the understanding of natural right hold by hamilton and others among the founder
and year later hamilton would draw upon this same understanding as he point out the serious problem of coherence that afflict the argument for engage in a serious study of the bible or theology or the understanding of the american founder would be for most of them a exercise in grasp a understanding quite at odds with what they be pleased to call at this moment their own culture
when we begin with these student at amherst we have often begin in the study of politics by take something near to them something familiar then we try to show how strange it may be
at time we have start for example with professor robert dahl and his account of politics in new haven
professor dahl find a diffusion of power in the politics of his city with different set of people be dominant in make policy say in the domain of education or real estate or public works
a certain political elite command a presence in all of these field but the dominance of this elite be supposed to be offset by the fact that the leader turn out to be the most committed to more than any other citizen the leader be commit to the rule of the game and the convention of democracy
but be those rule or norm like the rule of baseball or chess be they like the rule that establish that we get a base on ball after four pitch wide of the strike zone the rule on ball and strike or the number of man in the lineup be merely convention we could readily change them without do anything of moral significance and that may prompt us to ask just why political rule be good and just why the political elite respect them
after all the political elite may support these rule because they be the rule under which they have be successful
and they may continue to support them only as those rule continue to supply them with far success
there be a notable difference between a willingness to uphold the socalled rule of the game for that reason a willingness to respect the principle both good and true that those rule describe a political regime that be morally superior to a despotism
and yet that be not the understanding of professor dahl
dahl think that the principle of democracy be in the end too nebulous to claim much meaning let alone truth
they be part rather of a creed or a belief
that the most educated people seem to support a democratic regime more fully be explicable to him because education be the source of their indoctrination into these belief
at this point we be often move to ask the student whether they learn in school the pythagorean theorem ie the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle be equal to the sum of the square of its two adjacent side
and if they do would they be incline later to say that they be indoctrinate in the pythagorean theorem student find that a curious expression
they be more disposed to say that they learn the pythagorean theorem that when they come to understand the premise and the reasoning from which it have be draw
would it be possible then that the american founder understand in the same way the moral truth express in the declaration of independence the truth on which the american republic be found
but my colleague at amherst be quick to insist that no such analogy can be draw that political and moral truth can not rest on the same kind of axiom that underlie the truth of mathematics
in this respect of course they differ radically from plato locke and the american founder they purport to explain
there can be no more dramatic example on this point than the passage alexander hamilton be content to strike off as the opening paragraph for federalist 
the subject of that paper be taxation and in the course of that essay hamilton would not say anything about taxation that could not be say today by bob dole
but any literate observer would be bind to notice something strikingly different in the furnishings of mind hamilton choose to introduce his subject in this way
in disquisition of every kind there be certain primary truth or first principle upon which all subsequent reasoning must depend
they contain a internal evidence which antecedent to all reflection or combination command the assent of the mind
where it produce not this effect it must proceed either from some disorder in the organ of perception or from the influence of some strong interest or passion or prejudice
of this nature be the maxim in geometry that the whole be great than its part that thing equal to the same be equal to one another that two straight line can not enclose a space that all right angle be equal to each other
of the same nature be these other maxim in ethics and politics that there can not be a effect without a cause that the mean ought to be proportion to the end that every power ought to be commensurate with its object that there ought to purpose which be itself incapable of limitation
people tutor in philosophy could see in this passage a mind attentive to the teaching of thomas reid and what have since be call the scottish school
one of the fine character among the founder james wilson be himself a immigrant from scotland and when he take his place as part of the first supreme court he invoke the authority of thomas reid in the first case that actually elicit a set of opinion from the judge
that be chisholm xxv georgia decide in 
wilson would explain in a elegant opinion that there be no case build up as precedent under this new constitution
it become ever more necessary then for the court to speak about the principle of general jurisprudence before it would speak about the principle that mark the peculiar character of the american constitution
wilson take care to remind the audience of the court that the principle of legal judgment be merely a part of the law of reason and the authority of any case at law or any writer on matter legal he would invoke the authority of a original and profound writer in the philosophy of mind
he would appeal to dr reid in his excellent enquiry into the human mind on the principle of common sense speak of the skeptical and illiberal philosophy which under bold but false pretension to liberality prevail in many part of europe before he write
""
in other word the court would ascend to the task of judgment only after it insist in the first instance that it be indeed possible to judge the court would reject that skepticism in philosophy which deny the possibility of know moral truth just as it deny the possibility of know almost anything else
wilson would move from the principle of general jurisprudence to the principle that define the distinct character of the american constitution
but the principle of lawfulness and the canon of reason do the american republic could claim to rest on truth that do not depend for their truth on the opinion dominant in america
as wilson move through this train of reason to produce his conclusion he advance through the force of what he describe as fair and conclusive deduction
 seventeen year later chief justice john marshall would offer a striking example of how a mind tutor in the same way could derive certain constitutional right through deduction
the case be fletcher xxv peck and it be the occasion for strike down a act of the legislature in georgia
the case involve a grant of public land the buying of legislator and a attempt finally to strike at the corruption by rescind the original grant of land to the speculator
marshall and his colleague see in this act of rescind the grant the subverting or undoing of the obligation of a contract
the impaired contract be the contract that convey the land to the current buyer who be the case in this way marshall could have rest his judgment on a specific provision in the constitution the contract clause the clause that forbid the state from impair the obligation of contract
but he choose to argue in a notably different way
he try to show that the wrong engaged in this case could be deduce from the principle on ex post facto law
marshall explain that a ex post facto law be one which render a act punishable in a manner in which it be not punishable when it be commit
but what be mean by punishment many jurist have seek to solve a tricky problem by identify ex post facto law with those retrospective law that impose criminal penalty
but marshall recognize that the problem could not be settle in such a facile way
i will nt review here the subtle and search challenge he raise on this point let us simply say that marshall recognize that socalled civil penalty with large award of damage the seizure of property as emphatic and astound as penalty mete out through the criminal law
and so marshall be move to write
this rescinding act in georgia would have the effect of a ex post facto law
it forfeit the estate of the buyer for a crime not commit by himself but by those from whom he purchase
this can not be effect in the form of a ex post facto law or bill of attainder why then be it allowable in the form of a law annul the original grant 
marshall evidently share the assumption hold by many of the founder that the principle on expost facto law be indeed a principle of law that be not only true but true of necessity
if marshall could show then that the statute in georgia be really a species of ex post facto law he have every reason to be confident that the conclusion he draw about the wrongness of the statute be not merely defensible but compellingly true
his conclusion would flow with the logic of a syllogism
and in that event the wrongness of the statute would not hinge in any way on the question of whether contract or grant or rescind law have be mention in the text of the constitution
marshall draw out the import of this point with a far and novel recognition
he remark that georgia be part of a large empire she be a member of the american union and the union have a constitution that be supreme over its separate part
but as a result of the argument that marshall make in this case he could point out that the rescinding act pass by the legislature of georgia might well be doubt be georgia a single sovereign power
 that is even if georgia have not come under the constitution and the restriction of the contract clause the action of the legislature would still have be wrong
for the legislature have violate a principle that do not depend for its validity on the explicit provision of the constitution union
to put it another way marshall do not rest his judgment on the authority of the constitution
what he seek to show instead be that the contract clause in the constitution derive its authority from a deep principle of law that do not depend for its validity on the text of the constitution
and in make that transition he apparently think he be explain far more decisively why the passage in the constitution deserve to be treat with the solemn authority of a fundamental law
the section in the constitution do not mark off merely a convention or understanding establish in this country a understanding of what we in this particular tribe of american regard as a wrong
but rather marshall amplify the text and in his hand the provision on the obligation of contract be make to alert us to the use of law that be in principle wrong in all place
i have the occasion recently to recall a conversation with a friend who have military service
his student be all seasoned veteran in their forties they have all see military action but they be still twenty year later the people who have be college student in the s and they have absorb much of the secular religion that affect other young people at the time
they be on the whole skeptical of moral truth that hold across culture
they be willing to risk their life for their country but they be notably uncertain about the ground on which their country could claim to have the merit that justified such a risk
they would not claim that the political regime in america be morally superior to that of the soviet union say or vietnam
they would settle for the far more modest claim that our political way of life be at least ours
""
now i do nt deride this prejudice in favor of the thing that be ours
but at a certain point the passion for what be ours can not provide a justification principle of a free regime be the equivalent merely of the convention of baseball then it should be as plausible to change the principle of law as to change the rule on ball and strike or the convention on designated hitter
and yet be we really free in the same way to alter these axiom of the law that people should not be hold blameworthy or responsible for act they be powerless to affect that like case should be treat in like fashion according to the same rule that being who be capable of understanding reason deserve to be rule through the rendering of reason through a regime of consent even the dim of us may suspect that these proposition be not merely conventional
they be not ours because we have choose to adopt them rather we have adopt themwe have make them ours for the sovereign reason that they be compellingly true
marshall shape his argument in a rather elegant way but i would suggest that the man on the the kind of understand that marshall have touch
people continue to care about question of equity and fairness about question of reverse discrimination the burden of taxation the tilt in the court between criminal and victim
people persistently care about these question which involve nothing less than the term of principle on which we live together the term on which we constitute ourselves as a political community
and when people do show their concern for these question i would suggest that they show a awareness of that part of their life that be not merely local a part that touch on something of a more enduring and universal significance
for something local we go to zabar s for the cheesecake but for the condition of justice we be all athenian
section point of view
very often we hear protest against what be call the politicization of liberal education but before we can discuss that issue intelligently we must answer a more fundamental question whether or not all education be intrinsically political
to those myself include who object to use educational curriculum to advance a certain political agenda or who object to indoctrination in the classroom whether it be indoctrination in feminism pacifism leftism conservatism or whatever the response be always the same all education be a type of indoctrination for all education be inherently political
the argument go as follow education fill the student with some set of value either society s value or other value
what value get advanced be a function of what be teach of whether for example we read my shakespeare or your alice walker
educational choice be therefore political act both in deny the promotion of one set of view and in substitute one person s agenda for another s by what we teach and what we do not teach but in any event we always indoctrinate
there be i think three different response to this argument all of which have partisan if not reason on their side
the first accept the political nature of education the second dogmatically deny it
both fail to recognize the awkward consequence their argument entail
the third involve a critical acceptance of the politics inherent in education but still insist on the possibility of a education that transcend its purely political root
the first position try mildly to ask what all the commotion be about
it rather plausibly argue as follow while there may be some knowledge and some principle that be properly transcultural and transhistorical most education grow out of a particular way of life out of a particular culture
how a democratic man raise his child be necessarily different from the way in which aristocratic or oligarchic man raise their child
the education of a person in child will learn by grow up in new jersey
not only be this the way education work we want it that way we want our future adult citizen to know something about and even to respect the principle of our democratic way of life
if we do nt transmit our principle through education we would be do something stupid and suicidal
such be the mild version of the first position which as far as it go seem incontrovertible
the problem be that it be easily and often radicalize with indefensible result
the radical version run as follow yes education be the handmaiden of politics as we have just see
so what in principle be the argument against education in support of the new politics of the advanced professoriate no doubt it be political to teach in class that for example the united state be commit genocide in latin america or that property be theft but all teaching be political as you have mind when school teach the ideal of jeffersonian democracy but object when i say that america be a corrupt society that should be overthrow it be not that i be more political than you it be just that you do nt share my politics
once it be admit that education be not value neutral but rather the supporter of particular belief or a particular way of life it be also admit that all education be political and serve political end
now it be only a question of whose political end
consider for example the following all stance in scholarly research imply a prior commitment to some basic belief system
furthermore at its best contemporary humanistic thinking do not peddle ideology but rather attempt to sensitize us to the presence of ideology in our work and to its capacity to delude us into promote as universal value that in fact belong to one nation one social class one sect thus speak scholarship imply a prior commitment to a basic belief system what exactly be the objection to teacher who peddle ideology have radicalize the mild view that education be ultimately ground in a given set of value the council easily slide into the view that all know be ideologized and finally have nothing to say against indoctrination except that rabid ideologue might not be to their taste
the second response to the claim that all education be political be the answer do nt be silly
if you think that when i teach calculus or chemistry or which way the mississippi river flow or when eisenhower be elect president or who write volpone i be being political then you be just wrong
indeed common sense rebel at the broadness of the brush use by those who see education and indoctrination as necessarily intertwine
that a course in biology or mathematical logic could be political be implausible on its face and this despite or philosophy as if these discipline have their ground in a particular set of political regime
however this position though commonsensical have its limit mostly because it focus entirely on content and not at all on selection
why biology and not eastern herbalism why pick mathematical logic and not the study of the vedas and of course the politics of selection become much clear in the humanities and social science
what be so neutral about pick shakespeare instead of native american oral literature hardheadedness simply do nt respond to the argument at hand we make choice choice reflect value value stem from cultural social and political opinion
ergo teach the time table be a political act
common sense may rebel but be have not yet provide a coherent response
the third and perhaps most satisfying position would respond along these line yes all education do involve a kind of acculturation and acculturation be a kind of politicization in the sense of be and foundation of a particular society
but to equate teaching logic or science or even political theory on the one hand and ideological indoctrination on the others be madness
be there not a difference as even marx observe between try to understand the world and try to change it or to put it differently be there not a difference between a teacher try to possess a student s mind and have a student possess his mind for himself
i think this be where we must begin and i do it with much trepidation
yes education be political in the sense that it grow out of the culture of a people which culture be shape in greatest measure by a nation s political principle
but there must be a way of distinguish between the liberation of the mind through liberal education and the attempt to capture and coerce the mind through indoctrination
if we can nt do that we should give up the defense of liberal education as impossible and try something more useful the proponent of oldfashioned liberal education have long argue that reading text nonpolitically by that i mean look for transtemporal and universal truth or principle be the one good road to wisdom
the argument rest on the fact that some question and some answer transcend the particular political situation in which each person be place
it rest on the view that universal be possible
what for example do shakespeare teach about love or envy or loyalty or art yet the radical politicization of liberal education perforce deny the existence of universal truth universal insight or transtemporal wisdom once you have subtract from the accident of class race gender and political circumstance mr stanley fish of duke university write what be it that you have leave well if you have nothing leave if everything be culture race class and gender bind then there be no possibility of liberal education
you can not be liberate
at best even then you probably only make the switch because of the dictate of class race gender or politics
you can nt have make the choice rationally since that be just a prejudice
of course it be conceivable that people who say that all education be the propagandizing of mere value be try to deceive us for why would they spend their life push their value if they do not think them true but we should refuse to take the low road and accuse them of try to deceive us
we should give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they be only deceive themselves
but more
sometimes the partisan of the politicization of the curriculum admit to the fact that not only be all education political but moreover that all politics be struggle
all politics be a matter of get your way over others
thus feminist reading of literary text be sometimes portray as scholarly breakthrough imaginative and inventive and sometimes candidly portray as vehicle for the elimination in the global fight
or as jonathan culler of cornell once put it we can not have a canon of literary text since the concept support the fundamental misogyny of the reagan administration and would eliminate course in woman s writing
 hey hey ho ho western culture be get to go be equally a curricular slogan and a slogan for struggle in the street
sometimes the argument for curricular change in the direction of open proselytizing be so shabby as to merit giggle as well as tear
when stanford for example say it would far liberate student mind by give them book by contemporary ideologist woman and people of color to cover contemporary issue they do virtually nothing to shake the prejudice of their student or especially their teacher
rather they do everything to ratify opinion current in the wind
that this affirmative action program for already rife contemporary opinion could be describe by columnist ellen goodman as open some people get fooled if they really want to transcend contemporary opinion and liberate the mind they would surely read homer and dante and augustine rather than frantz fanon
but then again homer and dante and augustine might not support the various orthodoxy many in the professoriate would like to see promote
or to put it differently truly to open up your mind you have to read book that disagree with today s unexamined prejudice in such area as equality liberty democracy and right
such be the sin commit under the banner all education be political
understand in those term liberal education be impossible
where however do we begin especially since we have partly admit the truth that education and politics be not unconnected first i think we have to say that on one level acculturation be a necessary and legitimate part of education
many i think would find it sad for indigenous culture to reject their past and refuse to pass their skeptical of the worth of willful cultural suicide
in the same way we should be skeptical of the attempt make in our own midst to denigrate the study of this culture or of western civilization
know thyself to cite a impeccably western authority apply universally to japanese and papuans and nigerian as well as to american
if our student leave school with the most cutting of advanced opinion and do not know the foundation of this civilization and its work in its breadth and depth and detail they have be cheat
that say we must admit that mere acculturation or know our own proper as it be do not rise to the level of liberal education
it be however the firm ground upon which liberal education can later start
what be we liberate from if not in part from the possibly wrong but formative opinion of our parent professor and priest
if student do nt know who plato be or who write king lear we will have no reason to respect their more progressive thought
the vaunted pluralism of american society change this not one whit it seem clearly more necessary for recent asian immigrant to know who martin luther king be than for american black to know the cultural contradiction of cambodian society
acculturation be the way in which we take marginal group and stranger and make them fellow citizen and friend
nonetheless on the high level liberal education have to deny the argument that all education be political
it have to maintain the possibility of the liberation from the political opinion and prejudice of our friend and fellow citizen
liberal education rise and fall on the possibility of transtemporal transhistorical transcultural truth
it live on the prospect that there can be knowledge over opinion
some of those who wish to indoctrinate rather than educate do recognize this
if american capitalism be true or if marxism be true or if any other ism be true and it may be of course then liberal ideology
that would indeed be liberation of a sort
but liberal education have to be forgive if it begin with skepticism of this matter if it say let us read as widely as possible among those who might be the best author and most powerful mind let us learn something about the heaven and the rock and the atom and human nature and human convention
let us have the tool to judge for ourselves the truth of opinion others offer us
there be then two hallmark of a truly liberal education first it concern itself with the greatest of human issue issue such as the nature of love hate know truth loyalty justice god beauty number mean and death
that is it concern itself with object of the mind and heart that can be transpolitical
and second it give us a variety of the strong best and most penetrating argument and view of these topic
it have no hesitation even when they batter and shake our deepest sensibility
to do anything less be to do the opposite of liberation it be to say we professor do not wish to liberate our student mind but only to possess them
or bad that we be afraid to liberate our own mind from the numbing or giddy joy of ideology
section report from the academy
the ss universe a floating campus sail around the world twice a year offer a semester at sea
the program be run by the university of pittsburgh but the faculty staff and student be recruit from college and university from all part of the united state

one say however that he would never openly challenge them on his own campus since he would be immediately brand as a illiberal crank or bad
it be partly this attitude of caution and timidity that allow a small minority inordinate power to affect the university in microcosm of a university be altogether characteristic
indeed the ss universe be a model of moderation compare to many a campus on dry land
under the circumstance i be very grateful to the academic dean a sensible and honorable man and a devout red sox fan under whose stewardship we manage to have a seemly and ideologically neutral graduation ceremony
the student with whom i have remain in contact tell me that their itinerant semester be the best experience they have ever have
i must say that living with them at dose quarter have give me a new respect for american student
i find them innately decent and sensible enterprising and fun they study hard and learn much
the program of study be on the whole sound and the proportion of ideologue on the faculty be low compare with the percentage inhabit most landlocked campus
one might have expect however that dose contact with their constant blandishment and doctrinaire harangue would have a profound effect on impressionable undergraduate
but render them impervious or perhaps it be just the tight schedule of study and their determination to enjoy themselves
in any case the student be on the whole no more than politely patient with the wouldbe mentor who never stop disparaging the system that have afford them this voyage

section for the record
editor s note in the regent of the university of wisconsin issue a document entitle mandate for cultural diversity which call upon each campus in the system to devise required program in cultural diversity education for their student
at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee campus a resolution require that all student receive education in the life experience of minority group be hastily push through the faculty senate before the faculty as a whole have a chance to review the proposal
one hundred and fifteen professor sign a petition demand a special faculty meeting but the administration manage to avoid it through parliamentary legerdemain and a compliant university committee acquiesce
reprint below be excerpt from a series of letter and address write by one of the leading faculty opponent of these proposal
they comprise a eloquent defense of the intellectual principle on which high education should stand and reveal the degraded nature of the process through which academic policy be all too often implement
september preformatted your letter of may and for professor william damon s article on racial disturbance in the university
it be kind of you to take a particular interest in our campus
if i may i should like to explain my opposition to the faculty senate s ger resolution require the teaching of minority life experience to all student
my objection be twofold
the first objection be parliamentary
in april of the faculty be unaware that the ger resolution be be entertain
this legislation be bring up suddenly at the very end of the spring term pass quickly in one afternoon and keep far remove from faculty participation even though two senator request a plenary ballot in the mail
why the haste why the secretiveness why the subsequent rhetoric of assertion why be the administration and senate reluctant to have the faculty examine such a profound and revolutionary general education requirement and why be the senatorial vote against faculty participation against the plenary ballot so onesided the senate intimidate be the senator vote under duress be their vote animate by political or extramural consideration rather than the good of the student these question remain to be answer
i have recently hear it argue that some of the faculty be indeed inform or that the faculty be inform but not adequately
what sort of argument be this can you imagine a wisconsin referendum in which vilas county be alert but not brown county kenosha but not racine intimate of both political party but not farmer and factory worker surely such a state of affair would mean that the electorate be not inform
the same argument hold for the university of wisconsinmilwaukee
the administration should have use its colorcoded stationery pink with orange stripe to indicate that a decision of exceptional importance be at hand and it should have do so in the fall of so that faculty executive committee and course and curriculum committee could have examine and discuss the new proposal long before the april vote
academic decorum and the new ger resolution ought to be return to the faculty for a semester s consideration and debate and then in the absence of a responsible senate decide on by a plenary ballot in the spring of 
unless this be do the university of wisconsinmilwaukee will have lose its sense of academic shame
my second objection be far more serious
permit me to quote here the senate s ger resolution of april 
begin in semester i the university of wisconsinmilwaukee require every undergraduate to complete three credit pertaining to the study of the life experience of african american hispanic american american indian andor asian american as a condition of graduation
course satisfy this requirement will be so designate on the division list of the general education requirement course
the key phrase here be life experience
the paragraph do not say the history of the minority sociology of the minority anthropology of the minority their political philosophy or art history but their life so profound in high education as to exceed all other revolution
for what do life experience mean
the central subject as it so often be be history and historiography
have the resolution read the history of the minority it would mean that the university of wisconsinmilwaukee would have to employ a team of phd
s in history professional who would study the document and other record and teach the student from them explain the economic social political and cultural history of the minority
in this way the history teach under the new resolution would differ from the history of france england germany and other nation in content but not in methodology
the same historical principle would obtain and the course on the minority would indeed be interesting and contributory to the student high education
one might still argue against such course as a general education requirement i myself would so argue but one could not question their professional character
the ger resolution but their life experience
the discipline be omit from the statement and with them all thought of a university education go out the window one might call this phenomenon the defenestration of milwaukee
one do not need a phd
to teach life experience indeed a phd
would probably stand in the way since doctoral degree be not typical of the experience of any nation nor do one need a master s degree or even a bachelor s degree
the teacher could be a factory worker farmer salesman fruit vendor truck driver or on the negative side a miscreant or neerdowell and qualify for life experience
in economics it would be better to hire a store clerk than a professor since store and shopping be the stuff of experience and in course on urban costumbrismo a peddler or picaroon be preferable to a sociologist or literary scholar because he have the requisite experience
i be not suggest that factory worker farmer salesman and others be intrinsically inferior to but only that they can not provide the student with high learning
the student have make a contract with the university and seal it with their tuition and the university must give them the promised education or be culpable of malfeasance
i gather from professor damon s article and from your first letter of last spring that you be anxious to improve racial relation on this campus
several professor have tell me that the new general education requirement may have a different effect from the one intend that it may do more harm than good
picture a high school student arrive here his soul a tabula rasa
he may take a french or spanish or american history course teach by a qualified professor
he will perhaps enjoy a profound educational experience base on the accumulated wisdom of a discipline and of a scholar who have devote his life to master that discipline
he will be satisfy
then he walk into a life experience class the next semester where the teacher be a amateur who have to his anecdote will be interesting for a couple of week but unless he be a latterday scheherazade what will follow will he repeat himself over and over or romanticize the past falsify it or emote or complain about injustice or enter the future with prophecy without a discipline behind him what be he go to do for fifteen week three hour a week when i ask these question i be speak introspectively since i know that without a degree in history philosophy or literature my friend and i might entertain a class for a week or so but not much long
the student will quickly perceive the difference between history and life experience and the cause of the minority will suffer not because of their inferiority but owing to the simple truth that in a university anybody s life experience will suffer when unaccompanied by a discipline
if the university of wisconsinmilwaukee do not require the same standard of the minority as it do of everyone else then it kindly nor will the student

once again mr weinstein many thanks for your letter and article
it be always good to learn of your interest in our welfare

every worthy directorate will want to make informed decision and so i be write you concern the special faculty meeting of december 
it be a uncanny meeting with a elusive air and general want of academic dignity
there be a crowd in the vestibule gawk and gaping into the auditorium there be picket move about there be separate section for pro s and con be and most noticeably there be no debate
there be no intellectual discussion at all a attitude patently approve by the senate university committee and administration
i remember say to myself can this be so in a university be nt this denial of the intellect equivalent to burn the book
i shall not try your patience with all the detail which run to seven page i shall limit my letter to two episode both contradict this university s tradition
the gallinaceous crowd form in the vestibule be as large as the audience inside and every two minute i hear a strident voice cry out do nt go in do nt go in you will give them a quorum a quorum would mean intellectual discussion a appeal to reason
do nt go in you might have to use your intellect if you do
and so the galliformes bob about in the rear do nt come down the aisle to share their thought with the rest of us and their refusal come in the name of cultural diversity
the most lamentable piece be to come
i look about me and see that professor a be nt there he who have take so much interest in the new resolution
i ask a friend where he be and be tell that he have nt come because he feel menaced
someone on learn to him at lunch that day i do nt know you be a racist
i also notice that b be nt there and c and d and s and t as well none of those face i know and admire thirty or more of them
and i say to myself be they menace too be they call racist even though they be no such thing what a loss what a easy way to deny a faculty a quorum hold the meeting on a friday afternoon so that many professor can nt attend give insufficient notice of the meeting do nt permit proxy voting and then intimidate the professor with picket and the threat of be call a racist
i have search for a word to sum up these event for you and believe i have find it in the rough and tumble arena of modem politics
all these event be the product of muscular liberalism ml the devious rogue bean of the great state university of wisconsin
in the name of equality
and be sure to bring your picket and verbal brickbat when you do give it to em good lad in other word los liberales no lo son
what have become of the university of wisconsin
lady and gentleman do the new ger resolution meet your expectation i believe it do not but the damage be do and one can hardly turn back the clock
may i suggest however that you do the following and so bring your mandate to a honest conclusion
please send all the professor at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee a private ballot simply word ask them whether they favor the new cultural diversity requirement document and ask them to return the ballot to you privately so that you can keep them in petto
this privacy will avoid public embarrassment because the ballot be go to run at least four to one against the requirement
the ballot will also enable you to make informed decision in more mandate
as i write this paper about that phantasmagoric afternoon i think above all of my menaced colleague and the general air of unreason
i remember the crowd i see on december and the disrespect show the faculty more than a hundred of whom have request a intellectual discussion
let us hope this disrespect do not reappear in diversity classroom as it have on other campus
preformatted table
ps where be the sifting and winnowinga by which alone the truth can be find there do nt seem to be any only political coercion and a parliamentary coup deny faculty participation
preformatted table
the following address be present on february at a popcorn forum
it would seem that in today s world there be two basic way of look at the university
the first consider the university to be a problemsolving institution
the university will clean up lake michigan provide social justice discover the cause of crime provide remedy and take care of many inequity in the university be akin to the department of health agriculture welfare and also the police department
the education of the student be secondary in such a picture whereas the need of the community come first
under this view of the university the regent can issue the professor a mandate tell them what their philosophy of education be to be and the administration follow the regent lead can resort to parliamentary legerdemain to make sure the mandate be obey
this be what we have experience at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee a mandate follow by parliamentary evasion
the second basic way of look at a university be quite distinct from the first
it consider the university to be a academy a house of reason that have be set aside from the political and commercial world so that professor and their student can study dispassionately without the fetter of predetermined mandate and mission
there will be some passion of course like that of the poet who have intuitively light on a new metaphor reward with another dead sea scroll but there will not be the willful ruthless passion of quotidian politics
according to this view the education of the student be primary not secondary
all the student be endow with human dignity which mean they can not be use as mean to a end
the university exist for the student they do not exist for the university nor do they exist for the state
in the light of what i have just say let us consider the mandate for socalled cultural diversity
a university have unique tradition just as a hospital do or a court of law or a athletic team
in a hospital for example a certain room be set aside for specific purpose
we call this a operating room
only a few people be allow to enter here a couple of doctor several nurse and perhaps a orderly all of whom must perform prescribed ritual before enter they must scrub themselves with soap cover rule apply only in a hospital
they could not be exercise elsewhere for example as in a court of justice where many people must be allow to enter
on the other hand the law court have a judge who be really a monarch a person of tremendous authority who could not be tolerate elsewhere in a democratic society and certainly not in a classroom
finally a good example of what i say about special rule come from the sport of football where line of demarcation be draw around the field
within those line one can run into a man and hammer him into the ground possibly dislocate his shoulder
and the audience will applaud if you do the same thing one yard outside the line you will be give a fifteenyard penalty and if you do it just a mile away on wisconsin avenue a policeman will come to arrest you
the same rule do not obtain everywhere
and so it be within a university
a father and mother a free university where professor have to ascertain the truth and educate their student you simply do not issue mandate
it be not allow
in a company of infantry the captain will issue a mandate order his troop to seize the high ground because there be no time for committee meeting and democratic decisionmaking in the heat of battle someone have to give a immediate order
but a university be not like that for authority here be the weakest of all argument
a proposition be not true because plato or aristotle say it rather they say it because they have a insight into the truth
and geometry be not true because euclid say it rather he be a exceptionally talented man who discover many truth about measurement
the point be that mandate be out of place and destructive in a university
the argument have be make to favor the socalled cultural diversity requirement that university be biased even prejudiced because the curriculum insist on european author and institution predominantly caucasian
let us examine this accusation in the light of traditional study
in ancient time there be many great nation the egyptian persian phoenician mede hittite etruscan carthaginian and others and then there be the greek a small nation consist perhaps of a million people or even less
nevertheless in the university today one could base onethird or half of the curriculum on the greek alone or even more not because they be caucasian or our ancestor or our favorite or our crowd as they say in politics but simply because their creation surpass those of other nation
the philosophical debate we be conduct in this room today would be impossible without the greek who found the science of epistemology and the art of rhetoric
our very citizenship for example when we say i be a american citizen would not exist be it not for the greek polis which the roman subsequently adopt as the civitas or citystate
greek invention and the same statement will hold for narrative and lyrical poetry the homeric epopee and pindaric ode
and just take a look at our science philosophy psychology history mathematics zoology biology they be all greek discovery
why their very name be greek
there be no feeling here of a antihittite prejudice
and nobody be about to call the ancient etruscan and mede disparaging racial name or to create for the phoenician a humiliating pale of settlement
all these nation be equally welcome to the academic community and indeed a few professor will devote their entire life to study the language archaeology and history of their people
but in assign broad general education requirement one must throw one s support to the greek
it be a question of professional choice not caprice or political preferment
nor in this choice be there any trace of racism
we come now to the heart of the matter the student and their general education requirement that take regardless of their major field of study
traditionally student have have to take course in a few discipline for example in the college of letter and science they have be oblige to enroll in two discipline in the natural science social science and humanities which would mean history philosophy economics anthropology physics and so forth
but senate document which be under question here today specify a requirement in the life experience of four race hispanic afroamerican american indian and asian
what do lift experience mean do it mean a series of anecdote a advertisement of the self a rhetoric of assertion indoctrination a reduction of subject like philosophy and history to popular culture with a popular methodology or what the document do not say and the faculty have not be give the opportunity to discuss the question
one hundred and fifteen professor sign a petition request a meeting for such a discussion but the supporter of the meeting hall carry picket say socrates be dead gape and gawk into the meeting hall and refuse to come in
consequently there be no discussion no explanation of any kind
and the administration faculty senate and university committee wholeheartedly approve this nonfeasance
i ask myself this question and i ask you also why this refusal to discuss such a revolutionary requirement in education a requirement base on race rather than on the discipline and if one be concerned about transmit the culture of the minority to college student why use a vague term like lift experience why not say the history of hispanic immigrant the sociology of afroamerican the anthropology of the other minority to be teach by the faculty in the department allude to would nt this be the professional way of approach the question
let us turn now from the requirement to the student
the student come to the university of wisconsinmilwaukee may be adult socially but academically they do not display a familiar with louis xiv napoleon bismarck or cavour
in many case they have nt even hear these name nor can they place the thirty year war the french revolution and nineteenthcentury nationalism
in american history they do nt know the figure of our great civil war nor can they distinguish between our president for example between teddy roosevelt and franklin delano roosevelt
most of our student simply do nt know history
in literature they do not perceive the difference between a novel and a play between narrative poetry and lyrical poetry between a essay and a treatise
nor have they hear of the oral tradition the epic poem and ballad
the work of scholar like albert lord and milman parry lie completely outside their experience
the subject they be least familiar with be philosophy where pantheism the allegory of plato s cave noumena and school like cartesianism be word and thought they have never hear before
suffice it to say that the incoming student at that is they do nt know themselves
the general education requirement should be use to fill this void
please understand that i do nt object to the creation of course concerning minority
i be merely argue that they should not be general requirement mandate of everyone and i argue that they should be make professional by substitute history philosophy anthropology and the other discipline for the vague notion of life experience
we be here to educate our student not to transmit ideology
we be here to open a window on their soul not to indoctrinate them
the coercive mandatory nature of senate document which be push through the senate without the faculty s knowledge have create unnecessary grief here
the campus have be polarize over this superficial life experience document whereas a truly professional approach might have be widely accept
why do nt the regent and administration approach the executive committee of three or four department for example history anthropology political science and gentleman would you be willing to create a professorship in your discipline in the study of afroamerican the american indian and other minority we have set aside a ample sum of money to attract a good scholar and there will be some perquisite summer salary support a library budget some travel allowance and stipend for a couple of teach assistant
we want your new professor to create a few good course that will add to the education of our student and gain the respect of the academic community
you will have two year to complete your recruitment
""
i can nt imagine one of the department just name turn down such a offer although under faculty governance it be dearly their right to do so
but if they refuse then the authority without recrimination could approach the executive committee of other department such as cultural geography economics sociology and the foreign language
three or four such professorship with their excellent course would do far more for the coercion and our campus would not be polarize
these course would stand side by side qualitatively with other course in the social science and humanities and they would not require the crutch of mandate for acceptance
i should like now to close my presentation with a reflection on two thought that bode ill for our university
indeed they be ground for deep concern
lately i have be read professor robert o paxton s book on vichy france that is france from to during the second world war
the government there be beset with many problem arise from the tide of refugee who flee to france from all over europe and so it establish a numerus clausus a quota system for cope with these problem
it be not a pleasant picture
i believe that the new ger resolution senate document be really a numerus clausus a quota not only guarantee preference for some citizen but ultimately exclusion for others
and who know regent may mandate six credit in such a program instead of three or nine or twelve or more
why not the precedent have be set and the administration have show its disposition to engage in parliamentary legerdemain
my second thought be grind for even great concern
i would liken the mandate and coercion at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee to the lysenko affair in soviet russia
in this affair a scientist trofim lysenko be director of the institute of genetics in the soviet academy of science
unlike his colleague in other country he reject mendelian genetics in favor of the doctrine of acquired characteristic and owing to his connection with joseph stalin he force his view on soviet agriculture
the effect as you might imagine be disastrous
lysenkoism take the pose of a new freedom in science a blow for progress in the face of outdated traditionalism but the historical reality be different indeed
although the basic question be allege to be a new science it be really a problem it in the lysenko affair not only genetics but all the science impinge on agriculture be tyrannically abuse by quack and timeservers for thirtyfive year
the lysenko affair in short be thirtyfive year of brutal irrationality in the campaign for improved farming
i suggest to you here assemble this afternoon that something similar to the lysenko affair have happen at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee with the irrationality of socalled cultural diversity
cultural diversity be nothing of the sort it be not a generous intellectual effort but a dogma impose on us by the regent and enforce by the administration which clearly do nt want the faculty to debate it or vote on it
in the circumstance it seem a cruel joke to make student enroll in politically motivated racial course when their knowledge of their own culture be want and also their knowledge of themselves
note
a this sift and winnowing refer to the following statement make by the board of regents of the university of wisconsin in
gerard flynn be professor of spanish and portuguese at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee milwaukee wi 
section issue
during my year in washington and boston my duty have include give a substantial number of newspaper radio and television interview as well as write column article and book
i often receive advance telephone call from the media that go something like this
caller hello dr delattre you be a ethicist right
ejd no i be a philosopher
caller pause well whatever
or more often but that have something to do with ethics right
ejd yes
caller good
we be do a onehour spot next week on the barney frank affair or academic pricefixing or antiracist regulation in college or ethics in government or corruption in business or the drug control strategy or ethical dilemma in foreign policy and so on
we have someone to say that barney frank should be throw out of congress
we need someone to take the other side
we that we have to grow up and stop be critical of public official
where do you come down or more frequently how do you feel and be you our man
now to anyone who care about ethics or even about intellectual honesty this be pretty grim and frightening stuff
logician will recognize the fallacy of insufficient option the supposition that every real or fabricated issue have exactly two side both extreme
among the media few seem to recognize that some issue have many side while others may have only one that a responsible person can reasonably take
furthermore there be scarcely any sense among producerslet alone the putative ethicist of socrates ideal of dialogue as a shared and cooperative pursuit of the truth or the closest approximation of it by knowledgeable candid people of good will
instead there be a manipulative limitation of ethical discourse to passionate disagreement much of it incivil that be think to be entertaining and therefore marketable the presumption that each side will be resolutely impenetrable to any reasoning that may be offer by the other
thus be reason portray as a mere servant of the passion and seldom if ever as a way of thinking and behave that be ground in the socratic ideal of dialogue
often those who proclaim themselves fit to make ethical pronouncement for the media do not know the fact of a case do not know how to reason conscientiously and do not even have good manner
but they be entirely willing to be impervious to reason
i suppose it be not surprising under such circumstance that i receive inquiry from college student and job applicant i hesitate to say aspirant who say i want to be a ethicist for newspaper and television
where do i go for that kind of job i infer that they want to be celebrity not philosopher and ultimately will measure the success of their career by how often their name appear in column and how frequently other on television
these be the ambulance chaser of ethics
all of this tend to leave the impression that ethics be really indistinguishable from borderline moral fanaticism ordinarily lace with a unhealthy dose of political partisanship or at least the bias of special interest and motive have nothing to do with virtue principle or conscience
it leave the sense that all dispute must be settle by litigation confrontation or raw power and never by reasoned understanding that may lead to honorable compromise or even enlightenment
a central obligation of high education be to stand on high moral ground than this not only for the sake of student but also for the sake of instruct the general public
but all too frequently its spokesman lack the vision decency knowledge competence and ability to reason necessary to do so
not long ago for example the justice department begin a investigation of alleged tuition and financial aid pricefixing by a large group of prestigious college and university side on this issue
while there be relatively little dispute about whether price and financial aid package be actually be fix a surprising number of college spokesman be willing remorselessly to defend the practice
this defense of academic pricefixing be deeply disappointing but it be so typical of the shallowness offer up by such advocate that it can scarcely surprise us
the position run along these line certainly we decide together on tuition and financial aid policy amount and package
that be a lot better than have bidding war for student
and besides the cost of education should not be a factor in a student s decision about where to go to school
""
now if ever there be a selfindulgent instance of the fallacy of insufficient option this be it
such spokesman arrogantly tell the public that we have no choice but to suffer either pricefixing or bid war
they offer not the slight suggestion that another option be for each institution in light of its mission and staff compensation its degree of commitment to a economically diverse student body and its financial liability to set annually a responsible price in relation to actual cost per student to determine the portion of financial need it be in a position to meet and to decide the extent to which its mission require scholarship as well as needbased financial aid
nor do they provide even a intimation that have settle these issue as a matter of policy and principle a honorable institution would refuse to engage in bid war
nor be there so much as a hint that use moral restraint when confront with such option be as admirable in institution as in individual
add to this be the arrogant presumptuous and false albeit fashionable claim that family and prospective student should not take cost into account
obviously nobody should choose a college just because it be cheap or just because it be expensive
but as a matter of fact family and student should consider both price and cost though difference in select a college or university and they should be teach by high education institution the wisdom of do so
why consider for example two institution of roughly equal resource
one charge slightly more for tuition and fee but its educational cost per student be proportionately high because of more equitable faculty and staff salary and its noneducational general expense be low because of a longstanding policy of routine physical plant maintenance that avert the high cost of recover from deferred maintenance
or suppose that one be slightly more expensive because despite similar studentfaculty ratio for the two school one maintain small class size and include in its ratio computation only those faculty actually teach class and not those on sabbatical on leave or release for quasiadministrative duty and the like
or one charge high tuition or pay low compensation because it receive financial support from fewer alumnus in small amount than the other
what if the two institution charge exactly the same for tuition but one set that price high level of debt service while the others have build incomparably better equip science laboratory and upgrade equipment as often as be financially possible
suppose that one institution have foolishly and expensively settle extortionate lawsuit when it have do no wrong or incur great legal expense when it have
meanwhile another school have maintain low cost because of sound policy and wise legal counsel fortitude and a sense of loyalty to its own peer review committee
one can imagine other dimension of comparison at will
clearly anyone who know enough about education to take such consideration into account do so when decide which institution be better run and run by the kind of people we should want to teach and guide our daughter and son
to obscure all of this by tell parent that price or cost should not figure in college choice be morally base
equally base be the practice of tell this to our young when in actual fact how much their family spend on them may very much of their grandparent and so on
such blithe and selfrighteous counsel be a invitation to selfishness and injustice and a obstacle to the formation of habit of compassion
it be also a direct affront to any hope of their grasping what make a educational institution worthy of respect and admiration in its priority and policy
high education institution should conduct themselves so that they be in a position to set responsible tuition fee and they should be financially frank with prospective student and their family
this need not be very complicated but it be indispensable to genuinely rational choice
it also have the merit of recall college and university to the obvious fact that most individual and institution behave better when they feel obliged to be candid about what they do and why they do it
such conviction be the greatest spring of accountability possible as have be recognize since long before plato recount the story of the ring of gyges
furthermore nothing less than thinking and act about price and cost in this way can legislator executive branch official and taxpayer
the high moral ground on which high education ought to stand call for more of course than avoid logical fallacy and mindless presumption
unfortunately much of what pass for ethical discourse in college and university now be as confrontational incivil and tenaciously unreasonable as the vignette of media ethicist
who learn what from whom i be not sure but that there be striking similarity between the respective pattern of behavior no one can deny
in both there be sign of moral bankruptcy the belief that persuasion must be coercive and threaten that our fellow human beingswhether trustee faculty administrator or student have neither the conscience nor the intelligence to appreciate moral evidence and that only pass a specific litmus test on issue such as abortion south african investment gay and lesbian awareness cia recruiting curriculum reform and so on qualify anyone as morally decent
some institution allow student and faculty involvement in social
certainly student should become interested in the social and political question face a free people but they deserve to be teach that moral fervor be no substitute for diligent and systematic learning
there be little indication that student demonstration since the s have reflect conscientious study of the relevant issue whether in history philosophy government economics or the science
my criticism should not be confuse with a attack on moral conviction or freedom of speech rather it describe a pattern of institutional failure that allow student or faculty to set aside and even to obstruct educational purpose for which a school college or university have be found
in practice such acquiescence foster the impression that in matter of moral import passion and action be acceptable substitute for knowledge and deliberation
the rational pursuit of truth central to teaching scholarship and research be thereby dim and educational purpose be slight or even dismiss
the absence of conscientious study of the relevant subject matter and issue in moral protest against the war in vietnam and it be equally apparent with respect to the demonstration concerning south africa today
in each instance the moral principle to which protester have appeal be above reproach in the first that america should avoid unjust war in the second that apartheid be wrong
nonetheless because apply principle to specific issue require careful study educational institution have a obligation to promote a responsible process for reach judgment
those who forsake this duty by give in to student demand for the sake of peace and quiet teach the lesson that moral virtue can be separate from intellectual conscientiousness that noise and pressure be acceptable substitute for reasoned discourse and finally that the end justify the mean
student deserve institution that stand on high intellectual and moral ground in the classroom as well as outside it
some institution follow the path of least resistance have allow classroom and administration building to be shut down by student and faculty demonstrator
such closing replace moral discourse with intellectual inquiry and obstruct institutional duty
the administrative decision of yale and john hopkins and other institution to treat shanty as a acceptable expression of opposition to apartheid provide conspicuous example of follow the path of least resistance at the expense of educational purpose
building shanty may attract attention but it do not involve apply intelligence to confront important moral and political issue
as john silber president of boston university argue to treat student who be perfectly capable of harness their mouth to their mind as if they be incapable of articulate speech be a confession of bankruptcy
""
it be also dangerous and selfdefeating to believe that every injustice be intolerable and must be immediately remedy no matter the method
yet many demonstration be base on this misconception
a person who can tolerate no injustice can not live in the world because the world always include condition of injustice but such a person can not consistently opt for social change either because all substantial change be attend by injustice as well
the others and how to reduce injustice without betray other ideal such as liberty privacy and civility
these be often hard question to answer
surely high education ought not indulge symbolic expression when it encourage student to think they have do the right thing without make the effort to answer these hard question
to teach such bad lesson be to forego respect for the civilized intelligence that education both presuppose and hope to nurture
indulge member of a educational institution in such political activity pose a great threat to institutional integrity and the public trust than any possible external pressure
in contrast when i be president of st john s college and concern about south africa begin to spread across america the administration and the finance committee of the board of visitor and governor take the initiative and undertake a inquiry in the tradition of the comprehensiveness of the liberal art
that is they do not ask only should st john s as a protest against apartheid divest itself africa but also pose the question what should be the relation between social political and moral concern and the investment policy of a college devote to the liberal art the committee invite student faculty alumnus staff and board member to submit the best essay editorial and paper they could find on the question and collect them into a book of several hundred page for the use of the college community
it then arrange seminar at the college and with alumnus group throughout the country
ask that no one attend a seminar before read the book which contain diverse and wellreasoned point of view the committee deliberate for eighteen month through these public forum
by engage the community in a dialogue among reasonable people of good will the committee provided the opportunity for fruitful disagreement
it sustained civility limited tension between adversary and reveal the folly of suppose that when two people disagree one of them be invariably bad or morally insensitive
it show where the argument should a college refuse to invest in treasury bill because the united state do business with the soviet union should it ask to examine the portfolio of every donor to insure that none of the income have be generate from south african holding or from holding in other country that violate human right what about income from business whose product and marketing be dangerous or deceitful after these public deliberation the st john s board affirm its duty to advance the financial interest of the college by honorable investment
it decline to divest on the ground that the mere sale of share by one owner to another promise to accomplish nothing in the way of social justice
the board stand by the sullivan principle and resolve to exercise its prerogative as a shareholder in matter of corporate policy
all this be possible because the st john s board and administrator be clear about its educational purpose and be resolve to act in fidelity to them and also because the board clearly recognize and teach that it have both
now i understand that not every institution can undertake such inquiry on this scale
but however their implementation may be tailor to the relevant local circumstance the same principle should be apply
college and university after all be oblige to be embodiment of the ancient truth that the use of force and threat be never as satisfying to a person of excellent character as a resolution by persuasion and reason and that everyone who love justice reflect this in his behavior
some college and university seem to me to be lose sight of the irreplaceable power of the habitual and principled love of justice
they be establish regulation that have no potential to inspire moral aspiration the durable effort to become a human being function at his or her best as legal scholar lon fuller put it and which be not even likely to frighten student into behave well
thus the university of michigan the university of wisconsin the state university of new york at buffalo the university of north carolina at that threaten sanction against student as a mean of control what be now call act of insensitivity
these regulation may only succeed in make student suspicious and distrustful of each other and cause progressively great racial ethnic and gender segregation within university for reason of safety
they may also inspire conspiracy of vengeance and vendetta against individual suspect of have the wrong attitude and they will certainly indeed already do generate first amendment controversy as well as acrimonious wrangling among faculty member
such code will assuredly blur crucial distinction between emotionally hurtful speech and genuine violence
these rule however be very different from the rule against disorderly conduct assault and haze that be quite rightly enforce by the chancellor of the university of mississippi in september 
the incident to which he respond involve several fraternity member and pledge who strip two others scrawl racial slur on their body and dump them at nearby rust college a largely black institution
the chancellor s decision to bar the offending be require to keep faith with anything resemble the standard of a decent university
as a added benefit the debate that arise subsequent to his decision help the campus community to discern the error in one student s comment that the entire fraternity should nt have be punish for what a group of member and pledge do
of course it should have be a institution that can not prevent its member from commit the most egregious violation of serious rule have no right to be spare severe sanction
and the individual involved in such incident ought to be expel because they deserve it and because just punishment show what the university stand for
in contrast insensitivity rule will do little to teach student what their college and university stand for
they will become sign of hypocrisy in institution that sweep problem of drug consumption and alcohol abuse under the rug whose program of study be shallow and lax in expectation of student performance and where absenteeism be ignore cheat be commonplace faculty be be seldom available or facultystudent sexual intimacy be tolerate
and they will not overcome the covert message send out by faculty curriculum review that be incivil and warlike or result in the casting of moral aspersion and accusation of racism
to be respect rule must clearly reflect the broad moral sensibility of their author behavior
where administrator and faculty tolerate all kind of moral deficiency that be within their legitimate institutional authority to address student will treat rule as mere expression of power
they will violate them covertly remorselessly and resentfully and they will look shrewdly for loophole
such rule will not even teach that bigotry and prejudice be beneath us unworthy of us contemptible because they be a violation of all reason and because they be a form of blindness in human being that make us impenetrable to each other and therefore barbaric in our behavior
they will not teach anyone in kant s word to take the place and point of view of the other or the other person s skin and walk around in it
""
they will not teach the lesson of socrates or gandhi or frederick douglass that when one person mistreat another it be the dignity of the wrongdoer that be besmirch not that of the person wrong
they will not teach the lesson of selfreliance that golda meir learn as a child from the pogrom in russia or the freedom from bigotry that she find in milwaukee
the rule will not teach how the maccabean sage eleazar be different from ivan boesky or how to identify evil and resist its allure
they will not teach why the prophet nathan address king david in the third person by the parable of the lamb in order to draw him to see the evil of his treatment of uriah and bathsheba
they will never teach why nathan do that instead of try to make a rule
finally they can not teach in the word of josiah royce that it be profoundly mistake to believe that a neighbor s pain be life dim cold a pale fire beside one s own burning desire
""
of course it will be object that the rule be not supposed to teach all this
to this the reply be then spend your time do what be supposed to teach it
learn the foundation of habit of decency and a principled life take study not rule
at most rule address symbol and never underlying vacuum of ignorance and benightedness
principle be learn when they be learn by exposure to teacher and mentor of fine character by the disciplined study of works worthy of time and devotion by peer pressure for decency by opportunity to reach out to people less fortunate than oneself and by persistent reminder from the intellectual and moral climate of a institution that it expect its member to aspire to become educated man and woman who therefore embody genuinely civilized intelligence
this climate take much more administrative and faculty fortitude and diligence to foster than do the proliferation of implausible the persistent refusal to accept the idea that a educational institution be simply make up of conflicting group of constituent
""
a college or university be explicitly charter to fulfill a educational mission that normally involve teaching learn research and study
it be render taxexempt for the sake of this purpose
all who be member of its community help to fulfill this charge whether they be student teacher trustee cafeteria employee visit donor or security personnel
unless all be join in this common purpose its effort will be episodic and fragmented and this affront to mission be exactly what the constituency mentality cause
it endorse the belief that educational institution be compose of specialinterest group and teach that the purpose of governance and management be to adjudicate the conflicting interest of these group
once this impoverished vision of a educational institution gain sway the hope of building in the word of edward levi a viable and responsible community in which membership signify pressure duty be shatter
no curriculum can take the place of this persistent hope and aspiration but it can obviously play a major role in foster it
this will only be true however if the curriculum be conceive not as a collection of course but as a program of study whose success depend on the faculty member and student who give it life
even more important a curriculum will never become dynamic if it be base on the idea that how people think and what they think be utterly divisible because only if people learn how to reason together can there be limit to the range of possible disagreement
a genuinely reasonable person can no more blithely embrace a contradiction than blindly argue irrelevantly no more ignore the persuasiveness of rational argument than persist in the foolish consistency that emerson call the hobgoblin of little mind
such a individual can no more believe in his own infallibility than assume that his adversary be everywhere and always utterly wrong
thus be method and content irrevocably unite today obscure the fact
this provide another important clue to the design of a worthwhile curriculum student deserve to be expose to mind of the high rank to works of the greatest power because of their power and never merely because of their authorship
on this fundamental criteria inform by a respect for human history construct a program of study that ignore the distinctive contribution of a martin luther king jr a sojourner truth or a golda meir be as much a impossibility as design one that neglect socrates aristotle augustine or einstein
the curriculum need not and should not be limit to great booksit should include great art and music and dance great poetry play and speech great architecture great mathematical proof great scientific experiment example of great eloquence great sacrifice great mistake and great failure great disagreement great evil even if perpetrate by banal people and great heartache
in their study student should spend yes depravity
the latter offer a powerful motive for espouse intellectual and moral humility and expose the dark side of human nature
the former offer a survey of the magnificent range of human possibility and aspiration
learn both of these lesson be the ethical ideal
the intellectual root of high moral aspiration be firmly anchor in the high ground of greatness
dwelling on that ground be what give a college or university the right to be call a place of high education
otherwise it should only be call a place of later education

this paper be base on a keynote address present to the mississippi association of college on october 
for anyone who take a university degree more than three or four year ago read a college catalogue or be tell what academic be up to these day be likely to be a disorienting experience
a confusing array of apparently new discipline have spring up each call itself by a name that give little if any indication of what it might be about
a partial list of these name include poststructuralism reader response criticism gender study lacanian psychoanalysis critical theory theory canonicity semiotics cultural materialism reception aesthetic the new history the new historicism film theory critical legal study and comparable approach in anthropology the science and elsewhere
this be certainly a formidable array of term
but it turn out that the scholarly activity the term designate be remarkably similar to one another
however much the practitioner of these methodology pretend to be pursue new kind of study and however arcane their vocabulary they actually share a single elementary foster intellectual disequilibrium
the method be a assault on normative description of reality that is to say on our everyday common sense understanding of what the world be like
but why it may well be ask would anyone want to be involved in such a undertaking the answer lie in politics
for today s newstyled academic scholarship serve as a substitute for radical political action
the political ideal for today s academic would be to participate in a act of revolutionary overthrow or at least one bring about a radical restructuring of society as it be often phrase
naturally he be unable to realize this ideal directly
but in recent year mean have be create whereby he can enact something like this wish through scholarship
his course of action be base on what may be the single genuine insight of the new methodology
this be that society rest ultimately on a shared conception of reality among its member
without a silent consensus on such a matter it be evident resolve matter of law and equity or enter into contract
each field of scholarship rest on a similar conceptual contract
the practitioner of the methodology therefore reason again with justice that to shake the certainty on which their own particular field of scholarship rest be likely to destabilize that field
such a destabilization have in fact be accomplish in the humanistic and social science discipline and to some extent in the science cause considerable dismay among traditional scholar
in fact so thoroughly have such scholar be catch up in defend the traditional methodology that most of them have fail to recognize the challenge they be face for what it really be namely a political gesture
this gesture amount to be a academic imitation of a politically revolutionary act
radical academic believe that the university be structure in the same way as they believe society to be structure that is with a ruling class on the one side and a exploited class on the other
they conceive of the university as rule tenure professor
the exploited class consist of the young untenured professor and the student
by challenge the kind of scholarship practice by the old professor the practitioner of one of the new methodology fancy himself as strike a blow on behalf of the downtrodden
it would be a exaggeration to say that every academic who practice one of the new methodology think of himself as a revolutionary actor
some academic as i have already mention want to restructure rather than overthrow society
other especially graduate student and begin instructor may not be aware of the political attitude underlie the methodology they have choose to practice
just as a political movement include both strategist and distributor of flier so be it with the new methodology each have its theorist on the one extreme and its devoted reader and follower on the other
similarly just as in a political context there be those who grasp the ideological purpose of the opposition and those whose concern remain limited to the local and the practical of the new methodology
some understand the politics and some do not
still others understand but prefer to deny the politics
that however be a matter beyond the scope of the present essay
""
once one understand the politics of the new methodology it be relatively easy to see how each of them works
i propose briefly to examine four methodology deconstruction feminist criticism the new historicism and film theory
at first sight the four would appear to be as widely separate and seemingly unrelated to one another as could be imagine
each have its own barely penetrable terminology and claim to employ a unique analytic method
but the term encounter in go from one to another of the four turn out to be many way of represent the same few thing
in fact all four methodology come down to be version of a single surprisingly elementary concept that of class struggle
each of the four methodology represent class struggle on the same model of exploitation both a exploit and a exploited class
just as with the class analysis of the university furthermore the sin of the exploiter have to do not with economic or political dominance as they would in the marxist model that be obviously be imitate but rather with intellectual style
each of the new methodology designate the intellectual style it abhor by a different new jargonish term
but as the account that follow try to make dear the methodology do not really make discovery about reality
their purpose be to create a political drama in which their practitioner first invent a exploit and a exploited class and then in a kind of symbolic imitation of political revolutionism proceed to denigrate the one and identify with the other
deconstruction
among contemporary methodology deconstruction a mode of reading and discuss literature be consistently identify by practitioner of the other methodology as their source and inspiration
the central focus of deconstruction as represent in the writing of jacques derrida be a attack on something it they mean by logocentrism for the signature gesture of their movement be never to define or be entirely clear about anything
nevertheless it gradually do grow clear that logocentrism designate a supposedly mistaken belief in the stability of language and phenomenon
according to deconstructionist analysis the logocentrist deceive himself that the world be graspable by intellect and communicable by language
he naively believe as jonathan culler put it in his admiring account of deconstruction in thought truth reason
for this he be at once both ridicule and deplore
for all its apparent philosophical sophistication the deconstructionist attack on logocentrism rest on a garbled extension of certain analysis find in the lecture note of the early twentiethcentury language theorist ferdinand de saussure
in consequence of this garbling the leading assumption of deconstruction be seriously flawed if not worthless as among others john ellis have show in against deconstruction review by norman fruman in this issue of academic question
but even if one set theoretical problem aside in extreme of political bias
for logocentrism prove to be not so much a philosophical category as a way of identify and stigmatize something as bourgeois
rather than merely be deal with as a mistaken approach to reality logocentrism be take to be the crucial mean of bourgeois control over society
realityoriented language deconstructionist would have us believe function to impose a version of reality favorable to the bourgeoisie permit it to maintain its hegemony or control over the low class
derrida himself take this melodramatic politicization of the language question still far claim that the bourgeois hegemony extend over the whole globe
as he put it logocentrism be really a form of imperialism it be nothing but the most original and powerful ethnocentrism in the process of impose itself upon the world
the implication of such a statement be that when deconstruction attack logocentrism it stand forth as a champion of the oppressed third world along with anyone else the bourgeoisie can be think of as oppressing
feminist potential of the deconstructionist assault
rather than merely complain about man they could stigmatize the belief system that man have supposedly foist on the world
their term for this system be patriarchy
they accuse patriarchy of employ rigid logical category of thought that stifle woman be allegedly more intuitive instinctual kind of thought
obviously patriarchy be simply logocentrism transpose to the realm of gender
its characteristic be the same and its oppressive action be the same except that woman be substitute for the proletariat and the third world as the victim
as with logocentrism the concept of patriarchy quite fall apart under theoretical scrutiny
in the first place there be no such thing as identifiably male and female mode of thought
if there be the feminist analysis of history would force the conclusion that all culture and civilization be exclusively the creation of man with woman have be nothing more than inarticulate bystander throughout history
so supine a role for woman do the concept of patriarchy imply in woman could not possibly assert themselves in anything
there would be no theoretical way for example to account for the effectiveness of the contemporary woman s movement nor for its forceful use of language
theoretical problem aside feminist scholarship in history literary criticism and sociology devote itself to construct version of patriarchy whether it be in the action of feudal lord modem society or the plot or critical analysis of novel
in every instance woman be presume to have be casualty of action or think now categorize as patriarchal
the feminist claim to be practice a new kind of scholarship but be simply enact a version of deconstruction s attack on logocentrism
since they believe with the deconstructionist that the social system s stability rest on its dominant mode of thought whenever they identify something as patriarchal they be really perform a deconstructionlike revolutionary gesture or at the very least a gesture of protest
the new historicism
patriarchal man if he actually exist would recognize his double in the personality he would if this other new personality type actually exist
the new historicist claim to have identify a bourgeois subject sometimes refer to as the humanist subject
according to new historicist and to cultural materialist the modem personality a deplorable thing be form some time during the renaissance
at that juncture a emergent selfcentered selfish harddriving personality type push from the scene a dreamy more sensitive more humanly integrated personality
the lash of necessity to succeed in the bourgeoisdominated modem world then aborning produce the bourgeois historical subject and with him virtually all of the ill of western history since that time
not surprisingly the new historicism prove to be as theoretically unsound as deconstruction and feminism
it do not and can not produce any evidence for the existence of the bourgeois personality as richard levin have show
nor do its practitioner agree on what constitute this personality any more than they do on the characteristic of the personality type it be supposed to a version of patriarchal man who be in turn a embodiment of logocentrism
as for the new historicism it be little more than yet another way of attack western liberal society
this political purpose become clear when just as with derrida and the logocentric type a leading new historicist abandon history and theory for a direct attack on the present arrangement of thing
bourgeois discourse he write disguise a lust for communal suicide a absolute act of universal sovereignty
at this very moment therefore the bourgeois humanist subject be rush all of us toward the logical end of all its characteristic and desire a nuclear denouement
it follow that for at least one new historicist attack the bourgeoisie be not only another symbolic revolutionary act but also a urgent bid to prevent a imminent nuclear war
film theory
far more explicit about its political intention be the fourth and seemingly pure form of theoretical discourse on my list film theory
its purpose be propagandistic it seek to use movie in the service of political struggle
such a project not surprisingly require the invention of yet another equivalent of logocentrism this time locate in moviemaking technique
as bourgeois humanist man be supposedly precede by a more sensitive personality type the movie too once exist in a ideal utopian moment
simple pure movie make during the silent era before featured nonlinearity and acknowledgment of the depthillusion
according to contemporary film theory early movie do not tell their story in strict sequence and they do not attempt to deceive by pretend to be accurate representation of reality
their superior honesty presumably derive from their have be make for the early twentiethcentury proletariat whose member flock to see them in a expression of class solidarity
as rodowick explain it the preindustrial phase of cinema history be mandate by a proletarian public whose relationship to film as popular art be only later supplant by the man be yet again the villain
in the twentieth century he be still not yet satiate by his success in stamp out the prebourgeois humanist subject or by stifle female expression through the imposition of patriarchy
nor have he be render impotent by adhere to the selfdelusion of logocentrism
instead he have go ahead sinisterly to introduce in the movie both coherent narrative and a appearance of reality
as a result the glorious golden age of primitive cinema come to a end with devastating result for all but a few foreignlanguage and avantgarde film
film theory respond to this invent situation with yet another symbolic overthrow of the bourgeois order a vigorous attack on the coherence and illusion of life project by commercial movie
like the other new methodology in today s academy film theory represent itself as be at the cutting edge of contemporary philosophical development
rodowick for example describe film theory as a particular triangulation of textual semiotics psychoanalysis and althusserian marxism
as the last of down to the familiar and oldfashioned marxist fixing of blame on the bourgeoisie
whether contemporary theorist start out with logocentrism patriarchy the bourgeois humanist subject or depthillusion in filmmaking they invariably end up with a preconceived melodrama of bourgeois oppression
one need not accept the cliche of bourgeois oppression to agree that much depend on what the member of a society believe and do not believe to be true
the new theorist have demonstrate moreover that if the economic and political system of the west have become difficult to criticize from a radical perspective they be highly vulnerable to attack through their belief system
the traditional scholarly discipline in particular have be reduce to confused silence in the face of toolong assault
in contrast the new theorist have so far have to sustain few attack on their own certainty thanks to their long have shield themselves behind a virtual berlin wall of obfuscatory terminology
once it become clear though that behind that wall every edifice present the same go to emerge
deconstruction feminism the new historicism film theory and their allied methodology one can predict be destine to collapse well before the belief system or the society they have be attempt to undermine

figurative incompetence a thesis
suppose you make a metaphor and i do nt comprehend it
or again suppose you tell a joke and i do nt laugh
in both case something have not come across something have not get from you to me
what do this show it show that we be different certainly at least with regard to this metaphor and this joke at least on this occasion
be that all it show and how important be that that we be different in these respect you will surely think me different from you but might you also think me less than you or less than you would like me to be could you be disappoint in me and if you be could you be justify in that opinion of me a sober question which seem to threaten the fun in think about humor and figurative language but i think there be no real worry because these be wealthy topic with too much resilience a deft touch a little philosophical foreplay may make the real thing even more satisfying
i will do my best
my favorite way of thinking of these thing both offer metaphor and tell joke be in terms of a context of community
they be typically device or occasion for establish mode of intimacy way of share which render a group of people more than a collection of individual different people
when a person reach another in this sense of share something i call that pair or a large group if there be one a community and i think of the member sharing as a intimacy
in fact the group can be small than a pair
one can do this alone
it be a way of reach oneself of establish contact with oneself
in the last couple of year i have be try to understand this intimacy the form it take and why it matter to us
here i would like to speculate a bit about the use of metaphor and joke
the character of the intimacy and the nature of the community depend upon what kind of thing be be share and upon what kind of device be be use
if your metaphor or joke fail with me in either case there be two point at which the thing may have break down
if your metaphor escape me perhaps i just do nt see what you be get at
but perhaps i do and i simply do nt agree with you
if your joke do nt tickle me perhaps i just do nt get it
but perhaps i do and i simply do nt find it funny
we have better have some concrete example to help with these subtlety
my father use a particular phrase when describe a specific deficiency in beer
when refer to some new brand of beer and sometimes to a off bottle of a familiar brand my father would say it taste green or it taste a little green
""
i hear this remark many time over a number of year
often it be answer for instance by a good family friend dick rogers who would say you be right sam it be green or sometimes i do nt know sam it taste all right to me
""
although i have try and tried by talk and by tasting i have never know what these man be talk about
i often agree that the beer be nt perfect
i find it flat or stale or bitter but none of those be what green mean
i frankly do nt care too much whether we like the same beer although it help when we order in bulk but i desperately want to know what a beer taste like when it taste green
there may well have be equal frustration on my father side as he note that have support my education for a good twenty year he find me still green taste of beer
this example tend to blur the distinction between know what a word mean and recognize what it apply to but that be a distinction make to be blur
you may wonder whether my failure be to know what my father be talk about or to know how some beer taste to him
to work the distinction we need a different example
here be a passage by saul bellow that use metaphor to describe chicago
what advantage do you see here
there be the big advantage of backwardness
by the time the late idea reach chicago they be wear thin and easy to see through
you do nt have to bother with them and it save lots of trouble
""
you might not follow this that is you might not see what the speaker be talk about
if you do get it suppose you take it like this intellectual paraphernalia typically come to america from elsewhere
recently for instance there have be lacantype and germany and french theory of literature of the structuralist poststructuralist and deconstructionist persuasion
this stuff tend to enter the country on the east coast in new york new haven and boston and sometimes far down the coast baltimore for instance and at a couple of point in california
later it make its way to the intellectual circle of chicago but by then what may have seem novel profound and exciting be show itself to be mainly puerile sterile and gaseous
if you take it that way you be still free to think that the author be wrong and in that sense not to get it
you see what the speaker be get at but you think that as a matter of fact the late idea reach chicago as soon as anywhere and that perhaps some even come from there or you think that chicagoan be at least as much sucker for this stuff as anyone else and they do nt see through it at all or stuff and that there be nothing for chicagoan or anyone else to see through
imagine that you be the maker of that metaphor and that i be the recalcitrant hearer
what will distress you more that i do nt agree with you or that i do nt understand you at all although if i do i might well agree
the same question can be ask about the failure of joke
here be one for the holy season
what be sacramento
it be the stuffing in a catholic olive
if you have the temerity to tell that joke what would distress you more if it fail that your hearer just do nt get it or that he get it and do nt find it funny
at the risk of contribute to lame philosophy lame by itself for it construct rigorous definition exclusive distinction and symbolic contrivance as a aid to movement when in fact it might stroll freely without a crutch at the risk of do to need a metaphor which have both aid and paralyze modern thought
i mean the notion of outer and inner the idea that some thing be outside us and some be inside
there be the world outside me which i gaze on and try to describe and there be my inner self
to the extent that this metaphor be tolerable we may hope to categorize the successful use of metaphor and joke in terms of how much outside or inside ourselves they take us
these success on my view occasion community of intimacy
if i be permit the use of another dubious distinction that of subjectiveobjective i will say that these success tend to be more objective or more subjective and i will say the same about failure
if i understand your metaphor but do nt agree with it then we do not share exactly the same world for you find something in the world and i understand your description of it but i can nt find it
this chance to cohabit
we can nonetheless go look together
we both know what old threadbare idea be and although we do nt just now agree on where they be to be find we could hope to come to some agreement
if i do nt understand your metaphor then we may well not know whether we agree about the fact for i do nt know what fact you be allege
i can not go look or tasting for green beer because i do nt know when i have find it
i have undoubtedly taste beer which be what my father call green beer but that fact notwithstanding green beer be not part of my world
and this be different from the way in which unicorn be not part of my world
unicorn we might say be not part of the world
but they figure in my world just as say giant panda do
like everyone i have never see a unicorn
suppose that like i have then never see a unicorn never see a panda and never taste green beer
but if i think of my world as the totality of my possible experience then unicorn and panda belong to that totality and green beer do not and so i say that unicorn and panda be a part of my world but green beer be not
i wish it be
in both kind of metaphorical breakdown you and i fail to get together
the second case however the one in which i do nt take your meaning be less objective more subjective than the first
i mean it have less to do with the outer world than with the way in which we be try to talk together about the world
if you resist my way of put this difference be that because you do nt think these thing be as i say or because you do nt think my way of describe them make sense
a final note about the two level what level we be on or be not on together
suppose i refuse the metaphor about old idea come to chicago
if you determine that i understand the metaphor you be likely to suppose that my refusal show that i disagree about the fact
but maybe not or not so simply
i can grasp your metaphor without my have a sense of it perfectly congruent with yours
perhaps what i think be that indeed this intellectually lightweight fadism often play itself out near the coast but that this be to say that the steady scrutiny of the sun of critical intelligence bleach superficial color and so these idea be not so much wear thin as they be fade out
it be not clear now whether our disagreement be objective or subjective whether it concern mainly the fact or how to describe the fact
what be clear be that the distinction between the truly objective and the merely subjective be not such a good distinction to be lumber with
as with a failed metaphor a failed
if your joke do nt make me laugh then either i do nt find anything funny in this alleged joke or i do see what be funny but personally be unmoved by it
in the former case i do nt find anything jokey in your story and so i can not see why or how it could make anyone laugh although i may have evidence that it do
would you accept the idea that such a joke be not part of my world this would mean that not only do i not laugh at it but also i can nt imagine myself laugh at it
that be like be unable to imagine tasting green beer
i hope for a deep and simple sense of imagine
in that sense when i can nt imagine something for myself i can nt imagine it for anyone
that is i can nt imagine it period
this fanciful formulation recall wittgenstein
he say the world of the happy man be a different one from that place for thorough exegesis of wittgenstein but i will note one possible line of development
the world of the happy man be a different one from that of the unhappy man seem a radical pronouncement but it be not obvious how that could be give the context of the tractatus
wittgenstein have already say what bring the self into philosophy be the fact that the world be my world
since the world be the totality of fact it seem to follow that the totality of fact be my totality of fact
but let us not go into that
instead let us go into this if the world be my world and i be not you then my world be not your world
if you be a happy man and i be a unhappy man then of course your world will be a different one from my world but so will your world be a different one from mine if we be both happy unless like in be happy although i take a suggestion of the first line of anna karenina to be that there be no more than one happy family and probably not even that
the difference in our world be not due to your happiness and my unhappiness that be just a incidental feature
then why do wittgenstein note it
how about this suppose i be both the happy man and the unhappy man
perhaps i be both a happy man sometimes and a unhappy man sometimes and maybe i be sometimes a happy man and a unhappy man all at once
then the world of the happy me be not the same as the world of the unhappy me and there be a fragmentation of both my self and my world
a disintegration
according to wittgenstein one s happiness or unhappiness have to do with the world but it be not a matter of the world itself
the world after all be the totality of fact
""
happy man and the unhappy man although there be no way in which one could know this in terms of the solipsism of the tractatus unless one be oneself both the happy man and the unhappy man
leonard linsky have a poignant penetrating explanation when he say that wittgenstein conceive the unhappy man as be not sad but depressed
when a man be sad it be often because of the fact and if those fact be different for instance if someone have not die or if someone have return the man s love or if there have be more rain then the man would not be sad but when a man be depressed there be nothing he want of the fact that make up the world so it would not matter to his depression if they be alter
i be not wed to wittgenstein s idea of what the world be and even if i be i would still not like to adopt wittgenstein s idea of what can count as i be therefore not so concerned to distinguish what in me be a matter of the content of my world and what be a matter of how that world strike me
thus i make no objection to say that the fact of green beer be part of my father s world but be not part of mine
i be not go to resolve this and i be not go to have much more to do with wittgenstein here
i mention him only in order to beg at least a provisional license for speak about the different world of those who laugh and those who do nt
not to find the joke in a story be to have a different world from someone who do find it
when these two people confront one another in the context of the telling of this joke i think the situation be the same as one wittgenstein describe
we also say of some people that they be transparent to us
it be however important as regards this observation that one we learn this when we come into a strange country with entirely strange tradition
and what be more even give a mastery of the country s language we do not understand the people
and not because of not know what they be say to themselves we can not find ourselves in them
i do not understand a person i can not imagine him
i can not understand what a person say i can not imagine say that
this be to say that i can not find a place in the world for this person because i can not make his world my world
a case like this be most likely perhaps when the joke incorporate especially arcane feature
these be typically bit of specialized knowledge or information or line in another language
the what be sacramento joke be like that and so be these
what be round and purple and commute to work a abelian grape
where do the lone ranger take dump to the dump dump dump
i have take to call joke like these one which require some special knowledge for their appreciation hermetic
but it be not always a piece of information that be critical at least not a piece which could easily have be supply in advance
this oneliner for instance which i adapt from something i hear mort sahl say have frequently fail me with child
if george bush have run unopposed he would have be defeat
with some child it have not be that i could nt succeed in explain it to them so that they would then laugh but that i have nt be able to explain it at all i have nt be able to show that there be any joke there
the same thing can happen with adult
it be not likely to happen with a adult in the case of this joke but in general child be as able as adult to recognize joke which they themselves do nt case however different they be as failure of community at the level of understanding
i can nt see the joke in your joke and so i fail to enter the community of those who do
this be like my failure to understand what it mean for beer to be green
l can not make the word my own
i can not make them come alive for me
the difference between the uncomprehended metaphor and the undetected joke seem to be this if i do understand the green beer metaphor then i could proceed with you to the beer with a tongue toward check its ripeness
that is i would move out
if i do understand the hermetic joke then i could proceed to laugh
that is i would move in
this move in when it happen be a move into a community of feeling
this be as subjective as thing become
when it work when one of us bring it off by tell a successful joke to the may not be enough to redeem the world but it be a very sweet intimacy
and when a joke do nt work the result can be very bitter
when i offer you a metaphor or tell you a joke i present you with something
if it do not work with you i will be disappointed but i can be disappoint in myself or my material or i can be disappoint in you
if i be especially confident in my material then my presentation be a kind of test of you and i may rightly or wrongly consign the entire failure to you
what i do be to find it a fault in you that you be unable to enter the relevant community
it may console me to think you thus deficient but it will be little consolation unless i be a fierce egomaniac or a ferocious misanthrope for i must then think you so different that i be alone one of a kind
i have be talk about my heart be with the joke at least in this paper
let us say that there be three species of verbal overture with which you may be present literal description metaphorical description and joke
by any conventional measure philosophical or otherwise joke be the least important and they be typically think to be the least serious
that be because they be the least objective involve the least degree of testing verification confirmation etc
we can sketch the difference in objectivity quotient
six abbreviation will help to save space preformatted table
i assume when ponder this sketch that understanding come first and occur in the mind
the arrow show subsequent movement far in so to speak in respond to a joke far out in check the world for the referent of a literal description
in the case of a metaphorical description i show a double arrow indicate two direction for those who believe that understand a metaphor require a special adjustment no doubt anticipate my moral
i will not assert that the subjective side be the more important but i will urge you to consider that it be as important as the more objective
i need to know your inner self and my need to know that be at least as great as my need to know the objectivity of the world and it be certainly as important to my own humanity
if there be a thesis here it be this
when we fail to come together in any of these four way understand a metaphor apply a metaphor detect a joke laugh at a joke none of these failure be clearly more important or troubling than any other
in particular the most subjective of the lot not be able to laugh at the same joke although both of us see it be not trivial
some of the fine word on this kind of tragedy be from a recent story
the person who speak first have come to the end of leave him in danger of lose his job and bad
the people who threaten him do not know why he have do what he have do and he propose to tell them
he say i shall explain before everyone the thing that take place
if people be human they will have to laugh at it
he be answer as you like
but you will learn either that people be nt human or that you do nt know what human be like
they will not laugh
one must read the whole story to taste the bitter flavor of hopelessness in this exchange
the people speak be character in a story by milan kundera
the idea that know what others be like be to know what it be to be human and that this be of a piece with know oneself be present in the works of another czech writer more than half a century early what have i in common with jew i have hardly anything in common with content that i can breathe
this be from a diary entry by kafka
this be a mysterious and terrifying idea the feeling that one have nothing in common with oneself
be this how one would feel if one s self and one s world be disintegrate in the way suggest by the reading of wittgenstein on the bifurcation of the happy man and the unhappy man which imagine that i be myself both a unhappy man and a happy man i owe to my friend daniel herwitz the excellent suggestion that kafka s passage can be read to mean that it be because he have nothing in common with jew that he feel nothing in common with himself that in order to feel at one with himself kafka sense that he would have to feel at one with jew and kafka will not do that
the idea that i be try to locate in kundera and kafka be the insistence that to feel that i know myself i must think that i know my human self and that in
when this implication be throw into question by experience with people who be enigma to me then my feeling of self knowledge be also impugn
the idea be mine but i would like to find it in others
it be already a comfort that when i be first formulate the idea my friend ioannis manuelides put me on to the kundera story believe that there be something similar there
it be a question of know what people be like
this be not however simply know what people be like as one might know say what dog be like
it be to know what it be to be human
that mean that it be relate to know what oneself be like
what be this relation how do my know what people be like relate to my know what i be like i be tempt to say that the relation be identity that to know what others be like be to know what oneself be like
but that be a overstatement it because it be a blunt denial of another temptation which be to say that my knowledge of what others be like be base on my knowledge of what i be like as if i be make a inference to a hypothesis about others
i can make such a inference
i might note that a certain joke tell by me or by someone else make some people laugh
then take you to be like those people in relevant respect i try the joke on you and it work
i try the joke on the basis of a inference that you be like those other laughers
i can do this when i be myself indifferent to the joke when it do nt make me laugh
to use a joke in this way to have hypothesize that it will reach you when it do nt reach me be to engage in what i have elsewhere call a kind of fraudulence
i may however decide to try a joke with you do this when i be the other laugher
a joke make me laugh i judge that you be relevantly like me i try the joke on you
it be a mistake to suppose that all case of this kind be alike with the difference that in some of them i be myself the prior laugher but that otherwise all the case be the same with my inferring what you be like from what someone else perhaps me be like
this model be false to what i take to be the phenomenology of community
when we be laugh together at the same joke we be fellow we be alike
i find you in myself i find myself in you
if i adapt a insight of stanley cavell s i will say that in this particular mode of intimacy my knowledge of what you be like be of a piece with my acknowledgment of what i be like
it be not so easy for me to know what i know what it mean to be me
as hillel ask if i be only for myself then what be i
there be a terror that follow the collapse of the false security one feel at the idea that one might hide in oneself
it be not knowledge but ignorance that come with isolation
brave it out alone be a way of cower within oneself and it be the bad kind of epistemological and affective bankruptcy
it be the situation of be nowhere
the idea that isolation be no better than nothing and may even be bad appear in many formulation and if we recognize it in all its guise we find it in a astonishing array of text
kant document it as the condition of be free only negatively and not yet able to make that freedom amount to anything
kant s description echo those give by rousseau spinoza and aristotle and a even early narration be the one in exodus where the people be make to learn that of sinai be need to complete the freedom begin with deliverance
a seemingly more sheerly epistemological description be give by descartes when he observe with a disarming and frightening casualness that i can be absolutely certain with no possibility of any doubt that i be and still as yet have absolutely no idea what i be
i be speak of all these way of be alone as if they be the same
surely there be difference invest your sense of the world in a figure of speech and find no one to take your meaning have a aim in life which have nothing to do with anyone else s aim repose unqualified confidence in your own existence but find nothing to connect you with the existence of anyone or anything else
and yet the boundary that distinguish semantic psychological moral and epistemological isolation from one another may not be entirely distinct if indeed those boundary do not turn out to be a grand illusion
get across the sea be enough to to make them a people
get rid of external constraint say kant be enough to give us a chance but it take more if our life together be to harmonize
descartes s knowledge that he exist be a respite from doubt but it be only in his subsequent discovery of what he be that he unearth the key which unlock the door to knowledge of the world and its creature
hillel have already connect these thing when he ask not who be l or why be i but if i be only for myself then what be i
the sense that epistemological moral and emotional isolation be not so different from one another indeed that they may be three halloween mask on the same empty face be clear perhaps in artistic works
it be display in gaslight in the face of ingrid bergman near the end when free of the assault of charles boyer she stand outside drain finally completely mad
and it be hear in sad mad jani joplin s voice when she sing kris kristofferson s line freedom be just another word for nothing leave to lose
""
if my knowledge of others go with my acknowledgment of my self then perhaps i can not get in touch with my self without establish a relation with a other
this relation constitute the transcendental condition for make up a joke
the authentic creation of a joke be a event in which one truly tell a new joke to oneself
it be a discovery of one s own sensibility a acknowledgment to oneself of oneself
the shared laughter at a joke be a unique intimacy
it be not the same as the semantic moral and epistemological community i have mention nor be it a substitute for them
it be a emblem of those other intimacy and a kind of evidence for their possibility
you feel a bond with a fellow laugher and this feeling fortify your hope to be not always alone then perhaps we might often reach one another in various way for various purpose or for no purpose at all
your relief at find that they do laugh will not completely allay your anxiety at the prospect that they do not understand you or the world in the way you understand yourself and the world
and it should nt allay that anxiety
we have much more to do together than only to laugh
but if we can laugh together then we may hope to do more we might live together and not just side by side
listen once more to that awful remark as you like
but you will learn either that people be nt human or that you do nt know what human be like
they will not laugh
think of that
take it seriously
consider the horror in have to realize that people be not human or that you do nt know what human be like
it be unbearable
this away from the horror and contemplate what it mean when your joke do go through
when your joke works and they do laugh you secure a measure of conviction that people be human and that you do know what they be like
your success prove nothing
this be the point hume see with terrifying clarity but it surely do something as hume also see when he rejoice in be a natural man
you can not prove that your joke be funny but you can hold it out and share it with another human who find it as you do who laugh
that be a wonder i think fit to match the horror risk
pursue that wonder i dare say be a project which be part of god s work
it be a consolation

a driving examination a story
he be a old man all the time i know him from the very beginning and so he never seem to age not for thirty year
the only others who have be like that for me be picasso stravinsky and bertrand russell
but i never know them and i do know maximum
he be my grandfather
he be past sixty when i be born and so he seem a old man to me from the start
he have a memory that go back time out of mind out of my mind anyway and by the end of his life it be out of his mind too
when i be first old enough to really know him in the forties just after the war he be sharp as a tack
and he drive
he have a modest car well keep but far below his mean
his entire life be well keep and well within his mean him he be the owner of the maximum cohen general store several property in the town and three farm within a few mile in three different direction from town
it be in the store that i come to know him cohen s store as everyone call it and as my uncle who work with his father maximum would say in a loud voice when answer the phone
i see maximum in his store nearly every day after school
in that tiny town the commercial area the business district as sign say in those town be only two block from my home
my father s office a insurance agency be next to the blacksmith s shop directly across the one main street from cohen s store
i would look in on my father and then walk across the street to hang out in the general store
my early memory be from just after the second world war
at that time my father be restart his insurance business after his time in maximum s store
he soon move to the little building across the street leave his father and brother in the general store and that be how i remember thing
i love the store
it be a real general store
it sell grocery and meat my uncle be the butcher dry good of all kind hardware and nail and coal oil in the back and gasoline out of a hand pump on the street in front of the store
my grandfather be nearly always in the store usually at the counter near the front
he do not seem to me to do much
the visible labor stock shelf label can candling egg cut meat all this be do either by my uncle or by someone work under his direction
my grandfather take money at the cash register and write up charge slip and otherwise he make conversation with the customer
he also do business but i be unaware of that until i be a teenager half a dozen and other property lend money buy and sell note and the like
i be unaware of that business and so far as i could tell he be simply be cohen of cohen s store
during almost all of every day but sunday he be in the store
i know of only two thing that take him away besides lunch and haircut
they be trip down the street for short session in the card room where he play a hour or so of euchre and trip to his farm
he drive to the farm and he often take me with him
they be casual trip of inspection
there be never any stop just very slow drive past the field of corn soybean and wheat slow enough to see how the crop be do and occasionally to take note of newly erect farm building and newly paint old one
he never drive fast especially not on the gravel farm road and he be a competent driver
age that he be not a natural driver
i might not have notice his awkwardness so soon if i have not have my father to compare
my father be a splendid natural driver one of those man who drive as intuitively as they walk
a few year ago my father suffer a stroke and now his walking be force and mechanical but his driving be still fluid
unlike his father my father learn to drive when he be young
a family photograph from the early thirties show him with two friend about to go shotgun hunting
the other two be in the back seat of the opentop car my father be behind the wheel
paint on the side of the car be cohen s store
phone 
if you phone my uncle would answer cohen s store
it be maximum s delivery car and my father be its main driver
later when his insurance business be do well my father would drive his customer on farm all over the county
his early start and then all that practice have make my father a consummate driver by the time i begin to ride with him
maximum start much later in life and never drive very much and i note his lesser skill
he have master the operation of his car at least for his purpose
it be a dodge
like all car at the time it have a manual transmission but it be of a advanced kind call fluid drive i think and it do nt require so much clutch work
it be in that car that maximum and i would drive to see the farm and sometimes once every two month or so we would go to a movie together
we have to go to a neighboring town either six mile west or ten mile east because there be no long a movie house in our town
when maximum and i go out to a movie he drive even more slowly these movie drive be on a paved highway instead of gravel farm road because we go to movie at night and maximum drive even more cautiously in the dark
maximum be a immigrant
he be born in the s somewhere near the germanpolish border
maximum himself be unsure where he have come from he call it only the old country and the fact that in his naturalization paper he renounce all allegiance to the czar of russia seem to establish nothing
the official who handle those form be very personal and highly informal
maximum enter the united state when he be a boy come all alone
he come straight to chicago and begin a career as a downstate peddler bring horsedrawn wagonload of household item on trip south from chicago
he settle in central illinois operate a general store out in the country
when it burn he build another in our town and do business there for more than fifty year
he prosper
he bring a wife the mile from chicago
then my father and then she die just after my father finish high school
that be before and from then on he live as a widower
he be live alone except for his housekeeper and her daughter in his big house when i first know him
i know he be my grandfather but i know it as some child do without know what it mean
he seem to me detached in contact with everything his presence pervade the town push outward from his store right through the short street whose property he sometimes own and out into the surrounding farmland but in contact without be connect
he seem absolutely independent even outside time for he seem old but unaging
he speak a independent speech
he have a immigrant s accent which i hear nowhere else and would not hear again until year later when i have move away
he call his accent and every other broken or accented english a brogue
my father use the word brogue and a affectionate one
maximum always seem to prefer drive with company and although he do make solitary drive when he have a companion he often prefer to be the passenger
in the beginning of course i be a little boy and he do the driving but once i be sixteen and a legal driver i often drive him
my father would give me the family car so that i could drive maximum where he want to go
once i be take him to get a haircut
the barber be in a town a few mile southwest and our route take us past one of maximum s farm and then on through the farmland
as the road near the end of a cornfield i be drive slowly
among my friend most of them farm boy who have be drive tractor and pickup truck since they be very young it be a matter of pride to be able to drive fast over the country road
this can be difficult
the gravel be often tire in the rut
the road be narrow with no shoulder and sometimes steep drainage ditch on the side
it become necessary to drive on the edge of the ditch if you meet another car
i be learn to drive fast and i be especially proud of my ability to stay at seventy mph when drive over one of the bridge which cross the creek that go through that fertile land
atop the bridge would be two plank each about two foot wide and i would have to keep the car straight with a wheel on each plank or the car would swerve out of control
my pride notwithstanding i be drive slowly that day
it be prudent because fast drive on gravel road throw up rock which can scar the car and it be my parent car
and it be decent because maximum have always drive slowly so that we could both look
now we be look at the line where the cornfield end and a soybean field begin
a fence run between the
in the old day say maximum sometimes a fence would be hang on tree instead of post
""
i notice that the tree be evenly space although the fence be attach not to them but to post
i remember when those tree be plant he say
about sixty year ago
""
i be astounded
maximum have come to the time when he often recall sixty year ago with brilliant clarity and could not remember yesterday at all
i be seventeen and too stupid to realize that this mean that it be time for me to learn about sixty year ago and that maximum do nt need to remember yesterday because he could leave that to me
my father be give me the car more and more often in order to have me drive maximum and both he and my mother frequently drive him
the only one of us not to drive maximum be my brother eight year young
by the time he be he then become maximum s principal driver
the reason we be do so much drive with maximum although i do not know this at the time be that my parent be increasingly concerned about maximum s own driving
he be become erratic and even dangerous
it be his age
this be the right description i think and not one in terms of his physical or mental power as if we know that those thing be different or even what they be
he be now truly a old man
my parent could notice this and especially my father for unlike me they have know maximum when he be young
in his old age maximum drive even more slowly and not always in a straight line sometimes he would stop completely because he could not remember where he mean to be go
this be particularly worrisome when he set out for one of the neighboring town in whose bank he keep money or for a meal or a haircut
these drive be through from indianapolis to denver and in those day before the interstate highway system it be heavily use by highspeed traffic
maximum have become a peril on that road
the only problem with maximum s driving i be aware of be one that develop when he buy a new car with a automatic transmission
in choose the car he ask advice from my father
my father and the automobile dealer anticipate maximum s difficulty in learn to operate a new car and they think he would do best with one that do nt require shifting
surely a sensible idea but they be wrong
over fifty year of use a clutch have leave maximum unable to drive without one
by the time i become aware of the real problem i be live away from home
when i come back to visit my father often would arrange a drive for me with maximum
and he tell me that he hope that maximum would give up drive entirely
the idea be to show him that he and the hope be that maximum would see this and renounce his own driving
maximum would have to do it himself however for my father would not force him
at first i think the solution be simple
it be obvious that maximum must stop driving he threaten not only himself but other driver and their passenger
my father have considerable influence with his father and it seem to me that he must simply order maximum to quit
it seem so to me until my father tell me when he first explicitly introduce me to the problem that he desperately want maximum to quit and that he be suggest it to him but that he could not force this on maximum
i know at once that my father be right and that he be wrong and i know that i be see the complex depth of morality for the first time
i be and be infinitely relieve that it be my father and his father and not me and my father
when i be away news of maximum s adventure
it come in letter and phone call and it be a regular item like report of the annual farm crop and the doings of my brother
the farm crop be cyclic and unchanging overall a dry growing season be follow by a moist one a poor crop by a good one
those thing balance out
maximum and my brother however be change steadily in single direction
my brother be pass through his teen grow into the prosperity of adult youth
maximum be decline and his driving grow ever bad
he have retire from the general store turn it over to my uncle and this leave him with more time free for drive
even if my father mother and brother could have be available to take him every time he want a drive he still sometimes want to drive himself
by now he have suffer a few scrape and it seem a miracle that there have still be no serious accident
my mother he could not force his father to give up the car
she could not force her husband to force his father
it be a moral impossibility
for both my parent it be the kind of gripping paralysis one feel while be sweep into a disaster
the disaster would be maximum s inevitable ruinous collision
i think my mother s apprehension be more acute because it be more complex
when the accident come she would suffer maximum s hurt and whatever he bring to others and she would also share my father s inevitable remorse as he face the fact that it be he alone who could have deter maximum and then she would have her own guilt for not have try to persuade my father to persuade his father
my father remain unpersuaded he could nt stop maximum he could nt take his car away
a entirely unexpected remission be grant in the s
the state of illinois enact a new code of driver regulation one of whose provision be that any old driver must reapply to receive it
there be no chance that maximum could pass this test
my whole family look forward eagerly to the expiration of maximum s license and the relief that be bind to follow
my town be in a county which have only one driver s license facility locate in the town which be the county seat a little more than twenty mile away
when i be in high school all the teenager hunger for their driver s license especially the boy even those who have already be drive in their work on the farm
the license be a absolute liberator
we need car to get anywhere to do anything
my high school be in another town three mile away so that too required driving
everything we want to do have to be do after driving see movie go to ball game neck
and with the license one could finally do the drive oneself
in those day the minimum age for be license to drive in illinois be unless one s birthday fall on saturday or during the summer vacation one take the morning off from school go to the county courthouse to take the driving examination and come back to school before lunch time a legal driver
i be one of those who suffer the embarrassment of fail the test the first time
i can not remember what be wrong with my driving
there be a number of failure around that time and we all believe that the examiner be be harsh out of guilt because two boy he have license early in the year have subsequently drive into fatal accident
i pass the test the second time and immediately dedicate myself to learn to drive fast on the farm country road
a bit later i begin to study my father s driving in order to learn to give the elegant swift comfortable ride he give
i have be a excellent driver ever since although for many year now i have be mostly confine to bigcity driving where all one can do be play at lanechanging acceleration illustrate a worthwhile skill and where there be no chance for the expansive commanding generous driving i grow up with
i have already long be a crabbed city driver when the legal change come which would put a merciful impersonal end to maximum be driving
the day of his test maximum set out alone on the halfhour drive to the county seat
i do not know my father s feeling as he await maximum s return
would maximum be dejected and need consolation how would my father give that since his retirement maximum have walk to the post office once each day he have walk to the card room and infrequently he take a stroll
and he have drive himself out of town when he want
now he would be restrict to those few walk and even those be unavailable in bad weather unless someone be willing to drive him
could he accept that i wonder if my father think that maximum could accept it and i wonder whether when maximum have be go for more than a hour a phone call come through to my father s office
it be the driver s license examiner
maximum be fine the man tell my father and he be on his way home
driving
of course he pass say the examiner
do nt worry
maximum will have a license as long as i be in charge of this office
""
my family be stun but my father be relieve
if the law itself would not stop maximum s driving then my father s inability to stop it be excusable
my father live by a very strong moral code but it be a highly personal one and it sometimes accept legality as the final word
a more cosmic code apply as well however for it be now clear that all those year more than fifty of be a honest and successful merchant of be the substance of the community of be cohen of cohen s to drive
this be clear to the driver s license examiner and then it become clear to maximum s family
maximum continue his driving
my family continue to drive him as much as possible and my father see to the oil change antifreeze adjustment lubrication and the rest which keep maximum s car in good condition
after a very few more year maximum take himself off the road give up his car for good
there have be a few more minor mishap but the feared catastrophe never come
not long after that maximum have to take himself from his house and enter a nursing home
less than a year later he die
he be ninetythree or more
we have never know his exact age he come from the old country with imperfect record and eventually he himself do nt know his age
maximum die about fifteen year ago
by then only my parent remain in our town
they still live there but they spend the cold about mile
they drive themselves both way

a profession be among other thing its conference and yet what be any one person actually do when attend at the last mla in dc for example a woman ask me to shout can nt hear as a speaker begin one of the session
i almost ask her to shout herself and i want to ask her if she do nt think she be commit a gender infraction in ask me
but i do nt
should i have one simply attend a conference as we say
but what sort of behavior be authorize by such attendance or be attendance merely a occasion for any sort of behavior pretty much as it be anywhere else in nonconferenced life at which session do i hear which speaker on what text that demonstrate the multiplicity of identityrelated act
in the shuttle bus between the sheraton and the hilton i overhear a german woman with two interview whose husband she say be midwest liberal art college do you think they will do to deng xiaoping what they do to but then i miss the name because somebody behind me proclaim rather loudly that he be geographically mobile
the german woman seem to be very nice to the chinese man who in turn seem to be try very hard to give the impression that he be at ease with the energy of the conference
be geographical mobility a better representation of these energy than ephemeral conversation between a german and a chinese academic or than my notation that such a conversation have something significant to do with the conference
small world be the coyly ironic title of david lodge s romance of transcontinental conferencing which conclude inevitably at the mla
the text be so well know in the profession that elaine showalter during a initial session for grad student urge them to read it
she also caution that the executive director phyllis franklin be not authorize to marry people recall mention in the piece on the conference that always appear in the local newspaper and advise no talk about anything except politics and the weather in the elevator
showalter be nt worry about the best representation of the conference but she do reveal a witty consciousness about how it abide as a fondly represent not to say ceremonialized thing
she give no clue to her listener however about what any one of them might do with such a consciousness
lodge write that the megaconference that be the mla be no kind of fun for candidate who want job or chairman who have to interview them but for the rest of the member it be a ball especially if you like listen to lecture and panel discussion on every conceivable subject
but be it a ball even if you like to listen to what be speak outside as well as inside the conference room and what about those who get to speak i especially recall another conference this past year in the profession
he glow to his audience as he confidently rock on his heel and toss jaunty aside
we glow back at him and chuckle
certainly none of lodge s principal character attend the mla for anything so frivolous as mere fun
where they be not desperate for love they be desperate for recognition subject which such a impeccably sophisticated occasion as the mla have install into official discourse if only as respectively sexism and politics but have not institutionalize
can one now imagine a session sex during the mla it may be one of the curiosity of any conference that it aim potentially to institutionalize the totality of the experience that can be bring to it
meanwhile one could ask what to do among the unincorporated or fail fragment the trivial incident which nonetheless have some implication in what a paper will refer to as the torsional relation of the discourse or the stray vacancy that have not yet of its composition i do nt believe that there be a master narrative of the mla
there be a official one distribute among the official session
what i want to propose here be the unofficial one of drift in roland barthes s sense of the word or travel in a somewhat more general economy
in dc i meet a friend who be only interested in the one session on the one canonical writer who constitute his field
that be all
he do nt drift
how many i wonder among dc s be so exclusively authenticated if not with one interest then with one luncheon date to keep one luminary to see at last or perhaps best of all one paper to read how to tell how to tell the narrative of the great many more as once again it seem to me who sit edgily in chair before session begin congregate nervously in hall or lobby instinctively check the badge of anyone groan with the need for contact of some kind any kind this time i recall at one point the dc convention where the most sheerly exuberant people i notice all the cash bar have resemble as usual hastily concoct department meeting where nobody know the chair be watch the redskin playoff game in the sheraton lobby
i have expire there in despair myself have realize too late that i have misread the program wherein the single session i have most want to attend be clearly give as take place in the hilton
the sheer size and variety of today s mla present immense experiential problem to any single individual
drift be a solution
what if you do nt at one point i muse upon what might be include in someone s list of a ideal mla deliver a wellreceived paper meet a old friend from grad school hear another paper which decisively confirm the direction of one s own work have lunch with a eminent critic who allow that one s own work ignore the convention completely for both a afternoon and a evening buy all the most desirable book at the best publisher s booth for a full fifty percent discount and have sex preferably not encompass both afternoon and evening with a assistant professor from a university one have never hear of who admit afterwards be terribly impress with one s own paper
how many be there however for whom such a story would not so much be too cynical as just too overdetermined it may well be that the majority of conventioneer aspire to nothing so grand so implicate in all the imperative of the profession itself so formally convene
there be not a single moment of life from which one can not extract force provided one know how to differentiate it and combine it with others state foucault
what be the trick what be the trick especially if you have read foucault who elsewhere provide a fair enough description of the mla as both disciplinary formation so much in a person as in a certain concerted distribution of body surface light gaze in any arrangement whose internal mechanism produce the relation in which individual be catch up just so one attend any convention to be catch up it would seem
my own feeling however be that one attend simultaneously to extricate oneself or perhaps rather to see if and how one can do so
that is amid the disciplinary classification and systematic distribution of theme institutional affiliation regulated time official site ritualized exchange and highly saturated context there be ceaselessly available the moment wherein one either enact one s own subjective negotiation with something that be notmla or else one do not do so because there be nothing that be not mla
people attend the mla for many reason even if the mla itself value only one or two of them
one reason some attend be to travel through all the reason or anyway get catch up in as many any mla it be possible to have another impossible fantasy not only to be able to attend every session but to be able to hear every conventionsaturated word
since one can nt what consolation i believe there be only one drift
in the pleasure of the text barthes make drift equivalent to the atopic the asocial as well as to the intractable the stupid and even the suicidal
drift be not base upon a principle of denial idealize be
hence the despair of ideal either unrealized or unrealizable
drift furthermore be base upon logical contradiction idealize abhor such contradiction
part of the monstrosity of the dc convention be the fact that it immediately defeat even the fantasized logic of total attendance which may be why there be now so many more small convention where it be still possible to imagine oneself run in and out of all the room schedule for every time period
it be the very rhythm of what be read and great narrative write barthes have anyone ever read proust balzac war and peace word for word at the mla vie can indeed meet such people or at least listen to paper give by one who present themselves as such people
over against each one i would set barthes s scandalous antihero of a reader at the moment he take his pleasure which partake equally of what be not as well as what be the totality of what be officially give
but such a scandal seem to me to be very difficult to enact much less conceptualize
drift lie in the rhythm of what be attend and what be not attend
what might be most difficult be avoid make such attendance into a project
furthermore the pleasure of drift ideally exist at all time as available
but again what be not program i remember a fatigued moment in the sheraton lobby when i happen upon a sheet announce a special issue of a magazine devote to a have i only find myself drift into another version of attendance
one can i suppose ignore how utterly enmesh one be at today s mla and how fatefully subject to discipline
i have mention my friend of the one session
people also come to a mla to read their paper then leave
have they in fact attend the convention at all its variously representative aim as well as the social participation upon which such aim be predicate or reinstituted attendance only in its negative form what about those who drop in to one or two session then retire to the home of hospitable friend or local museum or hourslong drink in the lobby with yearsunseen colleague a mla remain after all a event but also a event that provide a pretext for any number of any one person be quite other event and yet drift away be not the same thing as drift especially if one enter the water in order not to get wet
i have also his son one evening of woman s caucus entertainment in order he hope to see lesbian dance a student who attend a afternoon in new york for the sole purpose of see what william empson look like and a nowretired former colleague who tell me that the best time he ever have at a mla be one afternoon at a palmer house bar drink with a prostitute who insist she could tell a convention of english professor from a convention of lawyer
one of the primary object of discipline be to fix remark foucault in a aside
it be a antinomadic technique
but how can a discipline prevent nomad especially if it be not so easy to fix the boundary separate wanderingaway from wanderingthrough
what should a impeccably affix mla member be interested in only certain thing just one thing everything in his memoir anthony powell recall that gilbert murray be once ask if he be interested in incest
only in a very general sort of way the in the first time slot of the convention just past be a session entitle the muse of masturbation
if one be nt interested in such a session how be one supposed to respond to it with outrage a bemused smile one could argue that either response be a legitimate if minor pleasure of attend the convention and furthermore that drift into and then out of some sort of response as opposed to the room of the session be more or less the most compelling theoretical desideratum these day when only a very general sort of interest in just about anything have replace some clear basis for exclude at least a few thing
of course subject or author be exclude
the interest that do obtain proceeds as always along the line of scholarly specialization rather than impressionistic whim
legitimate subject continue to be what the mla convention be in part all about
yet when what be program be incessantly lambast the familiar comfortable and canonize as globally diverse it be in a sense easy than ever before to drift
similarly now that all be discourse what of it that be speak inside the meeting room abide now as far less securely demarcate from what be speak either before or after the session begin
between session i chance to hear one man who seem to be speak about his paper declare sex in chaucer be
""
""
i deliberately decline to hear the completion
i be not sure why
because it strike me for a moment as more enjoyable to imagine myself how the statement could be complete or because i have some instinctive sense that any completion would just be a displacement of a more fundamental presence and of course it be the displacement which be interesting not the presence there be no such undeconstructable thing it be very easy as i say to drift
yet such a example illustrate just as much the problem of drift because it be too officially enable i think
happen to pass a woman who be say to another i be not sure if i want to go to the romantic cash bar
i smile
at the image of wordsworth welcoming guest while dorothy pour the wine maybe
be the woman s perfectly sensible hesitation a example of what inside the meeting room would be term a legitimating function of the convention itself or perhaps my smile be a decontextualizing move even a registration or mark of spectatorial consciousness
when the more commonplace discourse outside the meeting room relax from the rigor of that inside them one only attend a mla now i believe in order to discover that the outside be in fact unlocatable
the theoretical mandate for reinscription or recuperation be everywhere
one year i speak briefly to a man who appear to feel that the convention have be ruin for him because the subject of the president s address have not be publish beforehand
what to reply that carelessly or that the president may have lately be read deconstructionist critique against toolong year ago i meet another man whose sole reason for attend be to jockey for position at as many publisher s booth as he could in order to gain maximum advantage for the fifty percent buyoff on the last day
again what to say fetishize text be another thing the mla be all about although lately a rather retrograde notion because there be plenty of sheer textuality incipient or otherwise elsewhere to consume
at dc there could be observe the full display of how great be the disciplinary investment in look for gap node and interstix for the interpretation of textual practice
the once almost terroristically theoretical terminology such as valorize or erasure have be completely domesticated and the psychologistic vocabulary of displacement or scene be thoroughly in place in order to elucidate embedded narrative or genderinflected interpretive strategy
no great professional triumph can be secure at the mla unsettled or undo
in one session a speaker veritably pounce upon the subversive rupture of the logic she have be trace in the conflicting agenda of her author
this represent a very different sort of zeal from that rise off the pedestrian thematics of another session s paper whose author fail to restrain a knowing smile as he roundly declare the fearful truth in one s psychic imagination
""
but what sort of migratory triumph or just installation can be make just enjoy the lush selfenclosed dance of critical idiom for its own sweet sake that is quite apart from its hermeneutic or discursive labor in any specific instance
at the last mla in la i hear a word that i have never hear or read since deontified
it be recently in dc that i have a brief discussion over whether or not it be now more fashionable to say rupture rather than gap in one s discourse in look for either one more or less vulnerable to what it can nt recuperate or be unable to re inscribe one thing for certain this moment use up so many apparently simple or naive perspective that the canniness of drifting consist in be willing to appear dumb or just plain stupid before a ultrafied logic whose consequence as somebody joke be that you can nt write to your mother without put bracket around the m
""
do a system elicit a ultimately comic perspective from one who inhabit it by drift i believe this be too programmatic
just as no convention be in a constant relationship to its program no conferee be in a constant relation to the convention
the program indeed might be compare to a travel itinerary structure to bring the tourist to the great site to which might be compare the great subject or the great critic and yet permit enough diversion or free time along the way so that one might engage in but who would be the native at a m la convention the hotel worker at another convention this past year i have a pleasant conversation with the man who wheel away the movie projector from a session soon reveal himself to be a professor in charge of media conventionwide
the experienced tourist know that often the marginal experience prove more memorable than the official one which can be so crowded familiar or just inert that one may as well have stay home
sightseeing be a kind of collective strive for a transcendence of the modern totality write dean maccannell in the tourist a way of attempt to overcome the discontinuity of modernity of incorporate its fragment into unified experience
not a bad definition of conventioneering even if the most decisive difference be that the convention program unlike the tour itinerary offer instead a immersion in discontinuity
but this do not prevent a member of the group from suddenly find that the language of the rest be more exotic than that of whether the spectacle of over a hundred people cram into a hotel room and hush before the lone voice of a man or woman read a paper be mean to be a spectacle much less whether one ought to find it move or absurd
maccannell again
a authentic touristic experience involve not merely connect a marker to a sight but a participation in a collective ritual in connect one s own marker to a sight already mark by others
yet if something that be notmla can always be convert into something that be there will always be at any mla disconnect sight which will never be mark by others the convention be about recognition and its representation and every convention stage itself within the at once mobilize and dispersed tension between what be recognize and what be not
drift you not only disconnect yourself but fall into the seduction of a calculation whereby what no one else appear to mark become the only thing worth see
mla member be to notice a woman nurse her baby in the front row of one session and no one gape one evening at the famous critic eat scrambled egg and pancake in the company of two woman who each look as if she want to eat him
on one panel a real harvard professor in a real bow tie
do he or anyone else smile inwardly at the lineament of caricature at another session one female panelist in a bright lavender jacket along a solid row of gray male tweed
how many in the audience wonder about sexual politics the semiotics of professional fashion or something else more gratuitous the stray moment when one s sobere attention fail the hopelessly fugitive moment when one be elsewhere such moment be private plural uncomprehensive perhaps uncomprehending and certainly unrepresentable
it be no different with the surface of word the most fashionable dc discourse be so complicit with one s own subversive desire for mere enjoyment that it can be all too inescapable to challenge the certainty of written knowledge or question whether a text be capable of sincere or even authentic textual selfrecovery
""
at a early mla i once happen to be sit among a group of man when one rise up and radiantly move away to the sudden call for so it have be mysteriously give unto him of the rare of boon a onthespot interview
it have be about a hour since he have deliver his paper
exactly where be he ascending i recall the cavernous interviewing room
how could such a thing really be possible i feel i be witness to a professional miracle
yet recognition of course spread
at the mla one feel it as if it be a species of living stuff to be produce consume and reproduce
some get represent use up represent again and some do not
according to what basis jacques derrida have a essay for a conference which be therefore to him the dominant generality of representation to be authority
what authority exactly dictate what representation be less derrida s concern than the very category of representation itself which act at least since descartes to determine the apprehension of whatever it be that be of concern or interest in any relation at all
""
and at the mla be there finally anything more to say than that there remain like a kind of residue much of no concern or interest because there be so much of concern and interest all of it representable but what of that which be not like my own bemused wonderment at the onthespot interview be what elude meander by or deviate from authoritative representation necessarily fated to be as we say unrepresentative or do it have its own errant life after all in the representational machine which produce as in the case of the miraculously choose interviewee i do nt know if he get the job a represent subject drifting arise from the fact that it fail consistently to perform the work of represent itself like a traveler subject to forget where he be go or where he be be
and if it would represent itself as i have be attempt to do ultimately i believe by means of anecdote
in teletheory greg ulmer several time discuss the function of anecdote as one form of speculative organization although his primary interest be in those embed in the abyss of a theoretical discourse
what i want to claim myself be that anecdote enunciate a knowledge more miniature diverse random and incidental than theory whose narrative be sponsor by some governing idea
the idea of a anecdote in contrast be far less explicable without the conclusive unity between story and explanation
do anecdote furthermore propose a self whose identity be akin to the ideally multiply one of the traveler it would seem so
when travel that is thing just happen and if we want to add it all up we may not be entirely free of the feeling that it may not add up to anything at all
there be many story which can be tell not only as we say the representative one
so i have like to conclude my account of drift through the mla with two anecdote one about boundary keep the other about boundary cross
at least i think the anecdote be about boundary
i be more certain they be about selfhood specifically the kind that conference at once represent and fail to represent
drift as you please at the mla it be very difficult not to coalesce as yourself much as you trust you can either exceed or elude who you be in the interest of fine or shallow energy
next to me when i board the plane to fly out to the la convention be a severe owlish chap
surely not a english professor i think
but sure enough
produce a pen and peer at the first page
excuse me i embolden myself be you a english teacher he allow as how he be
go to the mla curt assent
such be the full extent of our intercourse
i already have a copy of the new york time book review in my hand and eventually somewhere during the time we bump over the rocky i produce my own novel
by then my fellow conferee be well into what be obviously his convention paper carefully lay out on top of his leather briefcase
he never look up until we land and the plane come to a full stop
i reflect that i could have be sit across from the reverend mr collins and i think of the sweatshirt which declare that its wearer would rather be read jane austen a motto to which would have to be add in his case for strictly professional reason
""
and yet and may have take me to be a version of him
my destinational query may have be too sprightly already to him a version of nonattendance just as his reply strike me as far too dry already a definitive confirmation of attendance
enjoyment quite possibly a grim term for him than me though not without its irony inseparable from mine
no matter what his behavior may have indicate have i be able to discuss with him what he take the significance of attend the mla to be i want to doubt that his answer would have be fundamentally different from mine
in the word of walter stone in a old idiom than i have be cite since they be publish over thirty year ago
a man s profession be not a mere appendage to life and ought not to be
it ought to be just as full of meaning and have just as much connection with eternity as any of his other activity
the convention be the ritual of his the activity of his colleague and his past in perspective with his present
it teach him where he stand in the world of his peer and where he stand in the history of himself
for in that permanent world outside time and place he meet precisely himself
i could put our agreement this way although the convention toward which we head be nothing if not saturate in more disciplinary relation than either of us would ever directly experience it remain a site in which we could confront our own identity nonetheless
and who do we find ourselves consuming because others be produce or delegate while others go in their own name
it be impossible at the mla not to meet oneself or not to repeat the structure whereby someone else reappear as oneself
be it possible not to go in your own name a concluding story
my own main purpose in fly to la be not to attend the mla
that year i be not even a member
so when i decide be inconceivable since much of the representational foundation would then collapse and even drift would become impossible since there would be no structure from which such a activity could veer i have to get a badge in order to fit in
one day i secure a badge for a single session
another day a friend loan me one for another session
after that session i chance to find still another badge on a hotel corridor floor
with this last badge i feel i have a identity at last or rather i have a floating signifier that could enable the matter of my identity to be dispense with
so it go
no one ever take me for the man whose name be on the badge
in dc three year later i meet a colleague from my own university
he introduce me to the man with whom he have be chat
this man look at my badge i look at his
on his read the very name of the badge i have find in too uncomfortably like meet myself
be it not a perfectly logical inversion of the structure whereby someone else reappear as oneself that oneself may reappear as someone else
badge of course enable recognition to be conduct according to professional or institutional hierarchy
badge required subjectivity to be represent officially
my meeting this man at once me and notme could only have be possible through the signify system of badge and yet the significance of the meeting could neither be quite recognized nor represent by the system
i be nt sure if i have drift into the system or out of it
have i exceed the convention framework or vanish beneath it
this past year again in dc i be especially strike by a statement from one session about the life of sign at the heart of social life
i recall my above meeting five year ago
again it seem to me to have no professional use and i believe i relax into the memory more confidently without very much resistance
i much anyway
its edge feel too rounded the day have be too strenuous i have feel too completely myself
the moment of the early dc meeting do nt make me feel fulfil just perhaps better disperse for drift through the mla be drift in and out of signification and it remain possible to enjoy some crossing for what they get rid of as well as for what they affirm
by terry caesar
many historian have argue that santayana s the life of reason mark the inauguration of naturalism as a philosophical movement in the united state
almost none however have note that this book be acknowledge by even its sharp contemporary critic for example arthur kenyon rogers as the first comprehensive presentation of pragmatism in this country or anywhere else
in this set of book santayana characterize knowledge as nonfoundational inquiry reason as nontranscendent or immanent criticism every sort of language as expressive imaginative or poetic every part of existence as contingent or historical and philosophy itself as a reflection on problem of human finitude rather than a search for first principle or for the really real
what be more santayana never give up any of these view even when his critic stop call his philosophy pragmatic and he himself have criticize the pragmatic school and distance himself from it
so what do the pragmatic santayana and the pragmatist disagree about and do these disagreement matter in be this santayana s pragmatic naturalism be religious in way that pragmatist like john dewey joseph ratner and sidney hook could not abide while their pragmatic naturalism too often boil down to strenuous moralism to suit santayana
caricature and overstatement lurk in the wing because the pragmatist especially dewey pay a lot of attention to esthetic experience along with morality and society and even claim that esthetic experience have a religious quality
but i still think in the end that the chief bone of contention between santayana and other pragmatist lay in santayana s attention to religious or spiritual life understand as something different from moral virtue and as something more fullblooded than some sensequalifying esthetic experience
there be six overlapping way to think through this contention
first by and large the pragmatist especially after william james be preoccupied with social life
they act as social critic or sometimes cultural critic
but one of the most remarkable characteristic of their cultural criticism lie in what it neglect there of solitude
for santayana spiritual life be concerned both with life alone and with life together with the question of solitary equanimity and personal wellbeing in the face of mortality as well as with the issue of social solidarity
santayana be criticize by pragmatist for his interest in human solitude
he be charge with be a oldfashioned individualist a escapist a romantic a mystic
for his part santayana criticize the pragmatist for their inability to see that critical thought extend beyond the formulation of social policy to problem of personal wellbeing that no social policy or social relationship could solve
there be not only lots of lonesome valley that people have to walk through but also solitary discipline that bring individual profound satisfaction as well
second in the pragmatist view life be no laughing matter because it be beset by tragedy
pragmatism as hook put it be inform by a tragic sense of life by the recognition and analysis of conflict between good and good good and overriding commitment to resolve these conflict
their social criticism waxed prophetic as it call reader to this duty chide them for their failure to live up to the social promise embody in the symbol of america its democratic institution and its motto e pluribus unum
santayana see thing somewhat differently note that prophet be constitutionally incapable of a sense of humor and advise his reader that the young man who have not weep be a savage but the old man who have not laugh be a fool
human life have its compensation
in his view people should turn to the task of resolve conflict as best they could
he say that tragedy be not to be deny or explain away as be sometimes attempt in cowardly or mince philosophy
but he suggest there be no necessity demand that people be consume by it
people not too much starved or thwart by circumstance and prepare to engage in spiritual discipline could take joy just while rome burn
santayana reply that if human life be no laughing matter it be probably just deadly and not worth living
third while the pragmatist undercut the enlightenment s quest to find a way to ground knowledge in itself they endorse a enlightenment commitment to the project of human selfassertion
here be dewey
faith in the power of intelligence to imagine future which be a projection of the desirable in the present and to invent the instrumentality of its realization be our salvation
and it be a faith that must be nurture and make articulate surely a sufficiently large task for our philosophy
santayana to the contrary picture human selfassertion as both indispensable and as inevitably fall short of its aim salvation as come with the love of life in the consciousness of impotence and philosophy as provide discipline for such affection
fourth and follow the pragmatist tend to construe philosophy as socially and politically engage a kind of inquiry that prepared citizen or their as a middleclass profession offering politician technocrat and other professional synoptic blueprint on which to base their social planning
santayana especially after write the life of reason inclined toward picture philosophy as a suspension of such business a interruption of normal social action a disengagement from policy and politics a disintoxication from the particular value that happen to shape up this or that society or polity a holiday from statesmanship
philosophy he suggest let people enjoy time out for intellectual festivity celebration worship religious meditation as well as cognitive or imaginative free play
the pragmatist take this characterization of philosophy as unprofessional irresponsible and sanctimonious a residue from a old world theological distinction between this and otherworldly concern
santayana on the other hand scold pragmatist for their shortsightedness for their fixation on what he call the political and economic foreground
he ask what good political and economic system could serve if they do not afford opportunity for extrapolitical find little good to say about distinctively religious narrative practice or institution which they picture as drain energy away from the problem of man while fuel superstition and fanaticism
they follow dewey s lead by distinguish between religion and the religious
religion dewey say amount to fixed and differentiate creed and cult that be indelibly supernatural in content and socially exclusive to boot
the religious on the other hand be a esthetic quality of any activity pursue in behalf of a ideal end so inclusive that it unify the self against obstacle and in spite of threat of personal loss because of conviction of its general and enduring value
suspicious of differentiating religion from other part of culture dewey try to displace them by underscore the religious quality of esthetic experience
he say it be in the creation and enjoyment of works of art for example that
we be as it were introduce into a world beyond this world which be nevertheless the deep ordinary experience
we be carry out beyond ourselves to find ourselves
i can see no psychological ground for such property of a experience save that somehow the work of art operate to deepen and to raise to great clarity that sense of a enveloping undefined whole that accompany every normal experience
this whole be then feel as a expansion of ourselves where egotism be not make the measure of reality and value we be citizen of this vast world beyond ourselves and any intense realization of its presence with and in us bring a peculiarly satisfying sense of unity in itself and ourselves
from santayana s vantage point this talk of get beyond ourselves to find ourselves by way of a sense of a enveloping undefined whole amount to the last thin gasp of hegelian idealism truncate religious tradition to a point that be laughable
he attempt rather to make cultural space for religion and ridicule the idea of some generically religious quality that could inform any activity
he argue that the more hopeless than the attempt to have a religion that shall be no religion in particular
and he prize particular religion for provide another world to live in
""
in his view otherworldliness do indeed have a function but it be strictly cultural not transcendent or postmortem
in religious institution people practice discipline that let them suspend the order of their normal social world particularly the differentiation and hierarchy of social economic and political life
there people practice religious virtue like piety or devotion to the source of their life spirituality or devotion to their ultimate concern and charity or appreciation of what be good for others as they understand themselves
religion give people these discipline both to let them imagine thing that bond human being together no matter what their social political or economic role or circumstance happen to be and to devise practice that facilitate personal equanimity
santayana argue that these discipline the religious narrative in which they be present in exemplary way narrative be not inevitably to blame for superstition and fanaticism
rather supernaturalism or the confusion of ideal and power be accountable for these thing
but the narrative and discipline that constitute religious tradition could be reconstruct or explicate in naturalistic way without destroy either their particularity or the difference they make for people s life
finally pragmatist pictured democracy americanstyle as the divine way of do thing
they urge people to pour all the fervor and enthusiasm they may once have have for religious tradition into a devotion to political and social democracy
santayana demur unwilling to call any one form of political life divine and willing to note all the way in which modern democracy whether socialist or consumer capitalist have end up pit equity and equity homogeneity and mass life against excellence
a good government government for the people he claim turn the force of nature as far as possible from enemy into servant and the pressure of society into latent power
universal suffrage be one but by no stretch of the imagination the sole mean to that end
in principle if not in fact santayana argue timocracy be probably a better arrangement demand equal opportunity but permit unequal achievement along with government by people who merit their assigned office by the breadth and depth of their accomplishment in economic and political art
now these six conflict that i have rehearse be not news from nowhere
they have a history textually inspire most immediately by theme in emerson
these be not conflict between emerson and his critic but rather between emerson and himself
society and solitude the tragic and the comic impotence and assertion or fate and freedom prophetic reform and spiritual contemplation the grace of communion and the cant of religion american democracy as divine life live at first hand and as the land of the dead alive condemned to life at second hand all these conflict be emersonian
but they themselves be ground in s protestant forbearers whether republican or theocratic
the tension i be think about descend from reformed christian preoccupation with grace and law with the view that moral practice while indispensable do not circumscribe personal life in its most divine moment that personal equanimity in some sense require let go of moral propriety that it call for some sort of solitary new birth or recreation that reveal simultaneously the limitation and genuine advantage of the social convention we inherit on the one hand and the lovely be lovable character of mortal life on the other that do well neither cause nor secure be well that personal wellbeing can occur but that it can not be achieve because its happening be gratuitous
these view draw with great precision by traditional reformed christian thinker like jonathan edwards outlast their original supernatural and christological context
they remain central when edwards himself drop supernatural and christian language for esthetic discourse in his battle with british benevolists over the nature of true virtue
they postchristian protestant effort as william clebsch put it to respiritualize a natural outlook that have become despirited
they remain at the heart of william james s quest to satisfy what he call the religious demand by search for supernatural power at work in the world
more to the point they shape santayana s utterly naturalistic understanding of the stress and strain between moral and spiritual practice
for that matter they also haunt dewey s equally naturalistic vision of the way in which esthetic experience outstrip as he put it moral consecration of the status quo
""
but now i want to ask who care about these tension anymore or to put it more personally and assertively why do i care about the prospect for a religious naturalism like santayana s and be my concern simply selfindulgent and atavistic i care because i share these view with santayana if we be concerned with the problem and promise of human finitude we have best attend to society and solitude because thing that impede it without come to grip with both
if by the promise of human finitude we mean the realization of such joy we have better make room for comedy as well as tragedy in our sense of life because it be comedy not tragedy that take joy as seriously as it do meanness
the comic sense require us to accept finitude and ultimate impotence along with our commitment to disclose the pretension of selfassertion
along with a devotion to human solidarity and often in its service philosopher in the west have traditionally break away from recommend social policy to meditate on such condition and our culture would be better off if they continue to do this
stripped of false explanatory account that turn ideal into power account that let people pretend that the universe work for truth and right forever or that empower us whoever we be so that we can dominate them whoever they be traditional religious institution narrative and cultural function
democracy americanstyle be not the divine way of do thing and the spiritual exceptionalism that suggest that it be by collapsing eschatology and nationalism into one another have foster more than a modicum of cruelty
american democracy be a handy way in my view if not santayana s probably the handiest to structure life politically
but this be so in great part because democracy have secure a culture that be eclectic thrive on a diversity of moral and religious tradition a culture endanger by homogeneity whether unbearably light or weighty
indeed democracy s worth as a political system be to be measure not simply by its commitment to selfdetermination or by its economic facility but also and more by its ability to sustain this diversity of tradition that discipline imagination in way that give point to human life
to my mind these six area of inquiry constitute a program of study for religious naturalist to pursue
so let me tip my own hand all too briefly me be commit to human solidarity
but we know that there be line some fine some coarse separating concord cooperation and fellowship from the sort of mass or bulk or uniformed life where as milan kundera have put it unity of mankind mean no escape for anyone anywhere
we accept harmony as a superordinate goal to keep in mind when shape up social attitude but we reject oneness unanimity and the deterioration of private life
why be this so why do the story of say kafka and kundera that explore the violation of solitude strike home to us with such force be it because we be socially dysfunctional or politically naive misanthrope incurable romantic or mystic dilettante no
it be because we think that human wellbeing or joy depend as much on what go on in people when they be by themselves as on what happen in their interaction with other people as much on private transformation and association as on social justice because more than anything else what be at stake be the imaginative life
it be important however not to read old epistemological or metaphysical presumption into this phrase
as i turn it at least there be nothing epistemologically private or asocial about imaginative life nothing metaphysical about it
i be for example write this piece not only for myself but for anyone willing to see or hear it and my capacity to do so be the outcome of a lot of socialization and training
my effort like all effort be experience and observable as plainly physical
but i have also turn aside from normal social activity ask people not to disturb me so that i might work out this way of thinking work on myself play with variation on old theme concerning human joy and the thing impede it
in so do i be as james would say experience the practice of imagination as solitary
cultural arrangement and discipline make this possible discipline propose new one and my performance play a cultural role
moreover i be given leave to do so by way of political and economic legitimation
but it be the performance my solitary attention to a interest my practical competence not social relationship or policy per se that be at risk and be the site of whatever agony and joy or sense of beauty go on
the performance may or may not be good for anything else in particular
it may or may not contribute to human solidarity
nonetheless it may bring me or somebody else some sense of wellbeing
there be something right then about richard rorty s suggestion that the old tension between the private and the public remain there be no necessary connection between private hope and social justice but only contingent practical one and thus it be right to abandon a quest for some theory reveal a essential human core safe beyond time and change link up such thing
decompose or recomposed
the realization of welloiled democratic practice and institution predictably will leave individual still yearn for solitude and have to manage the personal difficulty accompany loss and change suffer absurdity evil and death
there be no escape these thing and so pragmatic naturalist would do well as cornel west suggest to retain a sense of the tragic that highlight the irreducible predicament of unique individual who undergo dread despair disillusionment disease and death and the institutional form of oppression that dehumanize people
but the problem still remain how to display the meanness of suffering and then transcend it by celebrate passing joy and victory in the world which be a problem that comic vision seek to resolve
when essentialism still saturated thinking in the west critic explicate comic episode as event in which conventional social distinction or pretension separate people from one another get undercut disclose a core of humanity or community in which everybody could take some joy king and pauper exchange clothes the subversion of joke where say the welldressed lady slip on a banana peel and the reversion from selfconscious and constrained adulthood to playful or spontaneous childhood that be prominent in text like alice in wonderland let us abandon imaginatively at any rate conventional social difference for participation in delightfully real human union or communion that be acultural and ahistorical in nature
for pragmatist this explication of comedy can not work because nature be historical and human history be cultural and because as santayana put it in this world we must either institute conventional form of expression or else pretend that we have nothing to express
the choice lie between en a mask and a figleaf and the figleaf be only a more ignominious mask
but comedy surely survive essentialism
abandon such language do not disrupt our capacity to explore thing that let us laugh both at the absurdity of our own pretension and at the fortuitous bond that be forge with others who be really personality
embrace pragmatic naturalism do not spoil happy ending
comedy be contingent on incongruity and affinity not appearance and reality
but both incongruity and affinity depend on the occurrence of variation change continuity and coherence all of which characterize finite being live in a world that be historical all the way along
thank goodness that after year of nearly unexceptional blindness to comedy pragmatist like giles gunn and cornel west be once again explore its critical and imaginative function
gunn building on the works of kenneth burke and mikhail bakhtin reach for a cultural criticism that reflect bond strong enough to include in burke s word our own fundamental kinship with the enemy
this sort of criticism gunn argue
require the development of a critical language that not only challenge the privileging of its own term but also seek to undermine such symbolic activity everywhere by reveal the strategy in which we be all implicate
for this purpose only a comic language will do one that or at least unexpected and unlikely linking and comparison
west be develop a prophetic pragmatism out of the fundamentally tragic idiom find in such precursor as hook lionel trilling reinhold niebur and raymond williams
but speak as a afroamerican christian he have begin to celebrate the radically comic character of afroamerican life the pervasive sense of play laughter and ingenious humor of black which on his reading emerge out of the gospel as black read and act themselves into it
that sense of play laughter and ingenious humor i suggest be misread if it be construe exclusively as a expression of power which be how west read it
to be sure humor can imaginatively disarm the dominant and empower the oppressed
but radical comedy be not simply a contest of will
rather it involve a admission that in no small part what link us up be the powerlessness and mortality that we all share it be a acceptance occur as santayana put it when everybody acknowledge himself beat and deceive yet be the happy for the unexpected posture of affair
it be a performance he suggest that lead to forgiveness acceptance and understanding show us the innocence of the thing we hate and the clearness of the thing we frown on or deny
""
but if this sort of radical comedy cut ice then rorty s recent emphasis on private selfassertion truncate extrapolitical life
on rorty s counsel the old christian idea of law get naturalized when responsibility to god become responsibility to one another
democracy as he put it after nietzsche but without his sneer be christianity make natural
similarly though rorty do nt say this the old christian idea of grace get romanticized when new personal creation through divine encounter become selfcreation through strong poetry
emerson s life at second hand become harold bloom s horror of find himself to be only a copy or a replica some difference that make his i different from all the other i s
""
this certainly be one way to naturalize the life of the spirit
but rorty dismiss the western tradition that picture tension between selfassertion and spirituality the tradition of selfsurrender still prominent in james s religious demand for a sort of wellbeing that welldoing obstructed in santayana s advice that spirituality be constitute by the willingness not to will that be ingredient in radical comedy and more recently in richard poirier s reflection on write off the self
this be so because in rorty s view agonistic selfassertion be the only route to personal wellbeing worth recommend in a world without any supernatural power in it
he argue that the tradition of selfsurrender require a metaphysics of transcendence unavailable to naturalist
moreover he can not imagine a creative individual finding selfassertion hardly satisfying
but this tell us more about the limit of rorty s imagination and temperament than it do about the variety of seem weave into the need to worship a deity that escape natural constraint something new can be make of it that permit equanimity in light of natural contingency rather than despite them
we do nt require any essential or transcendent otherness to appreciate the wonder and beauty of other thing and people or to find wellbeing not in a i different from all the other i be that seem sure to be defeat but instead where our personal dissolution be accept
rather we require a particular temperament
we may require a temperament as poirier put it in favor of relaxation rather than selfassertion of drift rather than aggressive deployment of contemplative receptivity rather than active projection
but it be not clear to me why we need to exhibit one temper rather than the other
they be contrary not contradictory
can nt both be present sometimes even together be nt the tension between assertion and reception action and contemplation judgment and understanding better the other
to my mind they be
it seem to me however that most pragmatic naturalist still suspect that diversion meditation and discernment be decadent in a world sufficiently wretched to demand constant contention movement and decision
they write to mandate action and they picture contemplation and understanding as gesture that delay
but delay reaction be the better part of wisdom when people rush to judgment or even bad when trained functionary react according to convention without understand the role they be play
then there be no difference that make a difference as han blumenberg have put it between delayed reaction and conscious action

kundera have write that the modern era dawn twice over once with descartes who launch the quest for certain truth and again with cervantes who introduce the art of the novel a art that presume the loss of such certainty
the novel become the territory where no one possess the truth
""
""
but where everyone s wisdom he say
be different from that of philosophy
the novel be born not of the theoretical spirit but of the spirit of humor it do not serve ideological certitude it contradict them
like penelope it undoes each night the tapestry that the theologian philosopher and learn man have weave the day before
interestingly enough this characterization come very close to the line that santayana draw between moralistic life base on ideological certitude and spiritual life where people learn to suspend judgment and identify themselves not with themselves in order to understand and appreciate others who be different
for santayana spirituality be a second insight
""
""
detach us from each thing with humility and humor and attach us to all thing with justice charity and joy
""
the risk moralism run be fanaticism the peril in spirituality be quietism
santayana know this
that be why meditate on the idea of christ in the gospel he commend and spiritual openness judgment and understanding assertion and reception assurance and doubt attachment and detachment
suppose some of us pragmatic naturalist aim to embrace discipline and attitude like these
be this reason enough to engage in traditional religious practice and to meditate on canonical religious book surely as jeffrey stout have recently argue to great effect these practice do nt depend upon avow any traditional theological view
we need not as he put it postulate divine purpose let alone divine intention in order to engage in wonder awe and even gratitude a kind of piety in short for the power that bear down upon us for the majestic setting of our planet and its cosmos and for the often marvelous company we keep here
we can stout note keep our confidence loyalty hope and love proportion to their object and never make the merely finite our ultimate concern without invoke some ultimate other who deserve our this
but the religious virtuespiety confidence loyalty hope and love that stout avows have a history
they have be articulate by particular religious tradition teach and learn in particular religious community exemplify in the book that give shape to them and sustained as discipline by particular religious institution
if we wall to maintain the practice of particular virtue we need to maintain tradition community book and institution that shape live that way
at least it be not clear what other alternative we have
do it matter that the central narrative that render these particular religious virtue intelligible and practically formative be legend as religious naturalist suggest rather than revelation of the really real yes
it matter because it show the profound role transparent fiction play for us whether for good or ill by give us code or cipher that must be learn in order to practice distinctive way of life
can the practice we learn say as christian jew we will have to see but of course we will fail if we do nt try
we know that we need not take the stuffing out of tradition by do so
we have see the success for example of reconstructionist judaism thick with liturgy ritual that emphasize the willingness not to wild train in moral virtue and torah and talmud study
we have see practitioner in this movement not only keep commandment but experience the wonder and joy of selfsurrender
pragmatic naturalist like me no long have any interest in question like what be the meaning of the whole of history or what happen before anything else happen or what will happen after everything else have happen or how do we make direct contact with the really real we do not confuse ideal with power
so the shape of our tradition change
but we can still learn practice and give witness to them in way that maintain continuity and coherence with may remain culturally thick though vary without any semblance of supernaturalism
one of the thing pragmatic naturalist can not reasonably claim to be sure be any incontrovertible warrant for their own belief or practice
but if their understanding of belief be adequate nobody can
this frighten some people who look for one right way to glue everything and everybody together and who be repel by cultural plurality and eclecticism
people like this hold on as kundera have put it to the western dream of paradise ageold dream of a world where everybody would live in harmony unite by a single common faith and will without secret from one another
but others have recognize for century that this dream have wreak a lot of havoc
the historical record seem fairly clear
as kundera note once the dream of paradise start to turn into reality here and there people begin to crop up who stand in its way and so the ruler of paradise must build a little of time this gulag grow ever big and more perfect while the adjoining paradise get ever small and poor
""
to my mind stout be right to argue that the liberal tradition and modern democratic institution emerge in great part in order to circumvent this scenario or as he put it because people recognize put a end to religious warfare and intolerance be morally good be rationally preferable to continued attempt at impose a nearly complete vision of the good by force
he be right to suggest that this be why we school our child not to press too hard or too far for agreement on all detail in a given vision of the good
""
people who fault liberal democracy for permit plural intellectual religious and moral tradition claim that this drain us of concerted moral purpose and spiritual vitality they say that something close to complete agreement about moral or religious truth be just the elixir we need to cure the social disease that ail us
that be silly
earth and its atmosphere gut education colonize the urban poor permit rampant illiteracy or let the marketplace ration health care
these problem stem from amorality and immorality not plural traditionsfrom stuff like greed thoughtlessness and apathy
we simply do nt have to agree on grand design to consent to functionally adequate moral detail we do nt even need to agree to every detail to be genuine friend and compatriot
indeed our very eclecticism be a marvelous check on the pretension of grand design which bring me to my final reflection

that there be always another person in the autobiography of alice b toklas may simply be a way of say that this be a work that function as the autobiography of two distinct individual
the marvelous thing then be the way the book suggest these two stein and toklas live together it be the story of a life share of converging complementary life
but it be also a book that can be count on to produce another person a person whom the reader be likely already to have hear of whose name therefore represent something in its own right on almost every page
another person for example who turn up during that week be bertrand russell
these cameo appearance supplementary life serve to refine occasionally even to redefine one s sense of the two autobiographer especially of stein the one writing
this be why there be always another person like russell turn up to turn the heat up again
""
gertrude stein to divert everybody s mind from the burning question of war or peace introduce the subject of education
this catch russell and he explain all the weakness of the american system of education particularly their neglect of the study of reek
gertrude stein reply that of course england which be a island need greece which be or might have be a island
at any rate reek be essentially a island culture while america need essentially the culture of a continent which be of necessity latin she grow very eloquent on the disembodied abstract quality of the american character and cite example mingle automobile with emerson and all prove that they do not need greek
no they do not need greek these eloquent american
they might choose to learn it as emerson do then again they might not
thus donald sutherland the author of a important biography of stein s writing teach classic at the university of colorado for many year yet in order to pass a entrance exam herself know no greek
not only be such neglect entirely benign she insist but it even point to a peculiarly american strength which have its source in what she call in the passage above the disembodied abstract quality of the american character
but the language here be so disembodied and abstract itself that something more be obviously need to flesh it out
the disembodied abstract nature of russell s work on the foundation of mathematics for instance can not be what stein have in mind
take away the greek and with it the island mentality and it develop that a disembodied abstract quality mean something very different for the american character and for stein than it would when apply to englishman even those as uncharacteristic as russell
in a series of lecture she give at the university of chicago in stein assert that the english in the nineteenth century be characterize by the fact that they live this nothing more startling than that they be set in their way they have generally arrange thing so that life be predictable and conform to established pattern
yet not only be they settle their language be settle and it be with this language that american like emerson have to express a entirely different reality one in which the norm be not a settled but a unsettled life
consequently word which stein regard not merely as tool craft by human but as potentially person conscious actor in their own right begin to have within themselves the consciousness of completely move
in contrast to the british american and their word be relatively easily abstract from their circumstance and might wander off in any direction whether on the page or around the country
automobile as one of stein s example of a native strain of abstraction certainly facilitate this movement and what she call their serial production offer a entirely american model of the process
l leery ford s perfection of the capitalism successfully complete the abstraction of the finished product from the individual assembly worker with the corresponding alienation of the worker from the product
the worker no less than the model t be interchangeable and stein would insist that this form of abstraction be even more fundamentally american than it be capitalist
it could already be find in the work of the prophet of concord a half century before industrial capitalism have move its center of operation from england to a relatively democratic america
although washington irving and james fenimore cooper both crop up in her meditation on writing stein tend to set emerson at the head of her personal canon as she do in her lecture at chicago
those same word that in the english be completely quiet or very slowly move begin to have within themselves the consciousness of completely move they begin to detach themselves from the solidity of anything they begin to excitedly feel themselves as if they be anywhere or anything think about american writing from emerson hawthorne wild and dashiell hammitt sic and you will see what i mean
as the word be detach from the solidity of thing and from the british environment in which they have acquire their significance they inevitably become disembodied and abstract
moreover such abstraction or detachment clearly go hand in hand with a emersonian individualism that proclaim the individual s freedom to be anywhere and to do anything
the cost of this detachment be on the one hand emerson s apparent coldness what stein elsewhere call the new england tradition with its aridity and its sterility but also with its individuality and on the other hand the loss of the traditional craft with the opportunity they provide of perform a determinate even personalize function in the workplace although usually anonymously
the american tradition be most decidedly not a anonymous one and we probably have emerson to thank for that
yet aside from her sometimes extravagantly high selfregard stein would appear to have little in common with him of form may well be the most radical that america have produce whereas his much more regular generically be limit to gnomic verse lecture and a voluminous journal
but they both write for the lustre and be equally unwilling to impose conventional order on what they have write
if american writing be generally less tidy than its british counterpart emerson s and stein s be particularly so
still we do not find stein draw such comparison between herself and emerson
the only one of her predecessor she seem to have acknowledge with more than a passing reference be henry james whom according to alice toklas she like to call the precursor
but even about him she be less than candid
it have often be observe for instance that despite her assertion in the autobiography of alice b toklas that she have not read james during her formative period stein can already be find quote his novel the wing of the dove publish in which date from 
stein s denial of james s influence be even more duplicitous however than it first appear
she contend the passage in the autobiography begin
that henry james be the first person in literature to find the way to the literary method of the twentieth century
but oddly enough in all of her formative period she do not read him and be not interested in him
but as she often say one be always naturally antagonistic to one s parent and sympathetic to one s grandparent
the parent be too close they hamper you one must be alone
so perhaps that be the reason why only very lately gertrude stein read henry james
yet it be emerson and not james who in fact be the first person in literature to find the way to the literary method of the twentieth century and stein do herself something of a disservice by so stress the uniqueness of her own writing that she have be all too often take be as she also insist and as she genuinely be a central figure in the main emersonian line of american writing
but of course it be emerson himself who argue for the importance of keep up at least the appearance of selfreliance if for no other reason than that it be the only way one be likely to get anything of lasting interest do
when stein choose to discuss james s literary method as in her lecture what be english literature she describe it not as some radical break with the past but instead as typically american what american literature have always do
by this she mean that he write essentially after the manner of emerson
his james s whole paragraph be detach what it say from what it do what it be from what it hold and over it all something float not float away but just float float up there and so this make it that henry james just go on do what american literature have always do english one but the disembodied way of disconnect something from anything and anything from something be the american one
the way it have of often all never have any daily living be a american one
some say that it be repression but no it be not repression it be a lack of connection of there be no connection with living and daily living because there be none that make american writing what it always have be and what it will continue to become
although it can be say of james that he write in discrete paragraph this description be much more germane to emerson s method of composition which be generally to select paragraph from his journal and then forcibly to combine them
in this way the paragraph dictate the rhythm so often discontinuous of his essay
whatever james s paragraph be they be not about the daily life of his perfectly extraordinary american they be detach as stein say from everyday life
what they may say with what he be do in write such elaborate prose
stein s point be the fairly obvious one that jamess style be greatly in excess of what be need to describe life naturalistically but she carry the point two step far
first she stress that james like all the writer in emerson s tradition be never particularly interested in represent any kind of settled daily life per se
he would introduce foreign element that disturb the hardwon equilibrium in the same way his own writing and that of the other american revise the british equivalent
second like all these writer what keep him write and what his writing be mean to suggest if not describe be a high reality that transcendentally float above the individual paragraph
between this transcendental function and anything one might be able to gloss about daily existence there be simply no connection
i know that the world i converse with in the city and in the farm emerson write in the essay world i think
i observe that difference and shall observe it
one day i shall know the value and law of this discrepance
the tone here as most often in emerson be that of someone who although a participant retain his wit about him remaining dispassionate even objective
as with stein not only do this discrepancy and detachment underwrite both the work and the life it be the sole guarantee of any continuity between the two
the connection then be the lack of connection and american writing from emerson to stein if not write in the image of american life still convey its negative image not however as the representation of a repressed other but as the thought of a disconnected liberated self
as a harvard and john hopkinseducated american of the last quarter of the nineteenth century stein would have encounter emerson s idea everywhere more unexpectedly we now encounter her everywhere in his work
reality subjectiveness he write and he might have be describe stein s own writing
these be thread on the loom of time these be the lord of life
i dare not assume to give their order but i name them as i find them in my way
i know better than to claim any completeness for my picture
i am a fragment and this be a fragment of me
when emerson say that he list his lord of life as he do because it be the order he find them in his way he be be literally accurate and have a joke at his own expense
the line open the magnificent concluding section of experience and he have discuss the seven idea in exactly this order in the preceding page
all the same these lord of limit as auden call them organize stein s thought and write even more thoroughly than they do emerson s
whereas he retain which he could never keep up she learn to do without it and to rely entirely on the kind of subjectivism he express when he observe in the same essay that thus inevitably do the universe wear our color and every object fall successively into the subject itself
they both conceive of their first writing as largely scientific in nature with emerson try to pass himself off as a naturalist and stein perhaps more judiciously present herself as a psychologist
she rid herself more easily of the objective standard of a nonhuman universe and a impersonal language because the object of her study be always exclusively the human subject
stein and emerson both find the rhetoric of science amenable to the transformation they impose on it stein initially with her immense list of what she call people s bottom nature which turn on the minute difference that could be discern in basically repetitive behavior and emerson in the report he issue of his observation of nature and man
although he human experience emerson often do sound as if he be make absolute claim
the rhetorical nature of these be foreground however in the break in argumentation for which his essay many present initially as public lecture have become renowned
the claim be make with some effect not some absolute truth in mind
a undercurrent of pathos be produce by a recurring conflict in emerson s writing
there be on the one hand his strong desire for a knowledge of what william james be to call after him the stream of consciousness along with the desire to redirect the flow and bring the dead back to life
but against this he possess a equally strong disillusionment and sense of personal powerlessness
stein experience both the desire and the disillusionment in the early period of her writing which include melanctha and the making of american but in the decade that follow when she produce her most original work from the tender button through the 
while she continue to write by the rule he have formulate for himself she make even the discontinuous style of his essay look conventional
at the same time she embrace his muchmaligned optimism with its disburdenment of constraint and general abandon more fully than he have ever be able to
his pessimism which even he sometimes overlook have severely limit the range of his style
it assure that in the writing after nature his conscience always near to hand take the form either of his fear that he might have be abandon by something cod perhaps which ought to have love him or alternatively that he might abandon might already have abandon something or someone he ought always to love and cherish his dead son wife brother his possibly dead language
from emerson s observation that our life seem not present so much as prospective it quite naturally follow that any formulation be sufficient for the moment only insofar as it would continuous present that stein aim at in her writing be only a more generous interpretation of the same recognition
their writing style could be unashamedly although unequally fragmented because they both hold abandonment what emerson in other mood would also call transition discontinuity detachment to be the law of write as much as it be the unwritten law of life
it be the negative ground for the seven disembodied lord or lord of disembodiment in whatever guise they appear
that emerson tend to say the same thing over and over only rewrite for different occasion be not a failure on his part to think of something new to say or a clever way of dress up and merchandise the few thing he do have to say it be the invention of what at least in america be a new rhetoric
it be the kind of abuse of language that become necessary when people be oblige in order to distance themselves from community they use the same language as their oppressor
what make this rhetoric so new and powerful in emerson s hand be that he direct it against a literary tradition that however much it be his own be even more so another nation s a nation america have famously declare its independence from
as stein would insist a century later in war i have see the english language have present america with a peculiarly literary difficulty in prove itself american which no other nation have ever have
emerson with his fragmentation of british literary model his principled stand against good form begin to break the hold england still have on the language of america
this hold be utterly break only with stein s twentiethcentury transgression of all such sense and sensibility
""
but emerson be considerably more than just a literary theorist and stein who share all his central literary concern originality power genius language follow him in translate these into more general psychological term
human subjectivity life be not exclusively the domain of writing and they both desire to examine its operation in the broad possible light
one would then see more completely and nonreductively how writing actually do figure in it
for emerson s great theme be the experience of the individual confront by and confront in a single embrace the self and the universe the self in the universe the universe in the self
nevertheless his be not a psychology of the self if for no other reason than that the word self seem only to have play a marginal almost incidental role in the expression of his thought
he rarely use the term apart from emphatic pronoun like himself and compound noun like selfreliance and this be a fact about him that have be obscure for us by such extraordinary reader of his as freud and william james who have make the term so indispensable within the current intellectual climate
it be emerson to be sure who make the term indispensable but what be we to do with the fact that this be his single use of self naked and expose in the essay
what be the aboriginal self on which a universal reliance may be ground what be the nature and power of that sciencebaffling star without parallax without calculable element which shoot a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure action if the least mark of independence appear
what be we to make of this what do it make of us
first it be true that emerson possess a host of other term that correspond with various way of understanding what we call the self
these would include in this one essay man the soul genius mind human nature consciousness my nature my constitution a great soul every pure and wise spirit his will something godlike in him my giant essential man
all of these different as they be contribute to the remarkable definition emerson propose for the power that transform selfreliance from selfpossession or mere confidence into a way of act among others as that which rely because it work and be
certainly this be the self but emerson would refuse to name it here precisely because as he have suggest a few sentence early in what be among his most famous line life only avails not the have live
power cease in the instant of repose it reside in the moment of transition from a past to a new state in the shooting of the gulf in the darting to a aim
to name the self be to kill it off to deactivate or unplug it to put it to rest and one might say that the strength of emerson s psychology perhaps of what he he have to say about it reside in a accommodation of restlessness that be sum up in his refusal to call a self a self
""
but if in spite of this refusal he still do conjure up a self capitalize like a proper name and echoing sylph its opposite number it would be fair to say that at least there be nothing of the psychological in this aboriginal ground this ground of all originality
in categorize the self as a sciencebaffling star emerson distance himself from the line of beaumont and fletcher he use as a epigraph to the essay man be his own star and the soul that can render a honest and a perfect man command all light all influence all fate nothing to him fall early or too late
our act our angel be or good or ill our fatal shadow that walk by us still
these on emerson s own pseudoscientific figuration without parallax without calculable element yet remain merely in orbit around his sciencebaffling question
they offer up a weak because humancentered reading of what be essentially a negative originate denature even unman gesture on emerson s part
the moment he act from himself toss the law the book idolatries and custom out of the window we pity him man no more but thank and revere him for it be only in such act that the least mark of independence appear and that we can testify that someone have be genuinely touch by the negative nonscientific and nonpsychological mark of the individual
the moment someone act apart from himself he participate in a aboriginal self which have nothing to do with a personal self and daily existence
it be a sign of emerson s own independence and of the crucial element of negation in it that he should call be not
after her immensely successful sixmonth lecture tour through america in and much as emerson have lecture across america in the s and s stein choose to describe the country she have revisit for the first time in thirtyone year in category that exactly correspond to emerson s distinction between dependent and independent human existence
her term human nature and human mind be as disembodied and abstract even as undistinctive as she could make them but in the course of the extended meditation she write during the summer of which she call the geographical history of america she give them a twist that be not only distinctly american but enable her to redefine them strictly with regard to america
we use the same word as the english do she write some year later but the word say a entirely different thing
she determine that the lie of the land in america its geographical situation be the plumb line
it be always see as if from above flatten out whereas in other country it take on the feature of human nature and daily existence
america be thus uniquely transcendental with the disembodiment of american and of their writing embody as it were in the land
in other word america be even more a state of mind than be other country and this be quite obviously true
american for example might claim the country as theirs to make over only by forget the aboriginal claim of the population they be in the process of murdering and disenfranchise
with their transcendentalisms both emerson and stein respond to the simultaneous impossibility and necessity of live with the blood of genocide on one s hand and writing
this be the true lie of the land
the saving grace as well as a large part of the horror be that it be so easy not to acknowledge the brutal fact and to imagine a virgin america that bore no relation to s paragraph just float float up there
stein provide in the geographical history of america a analysis of the american writing that she and emerson and a few others invent and reinvent point to the relation between it and the awful blank of american geographical history
the line at the bottom of the first page tell all in the united state there be more space where nobody be than where anybody be
that be what make america what it be

when emerson describe man he do not talk of the person one might meet anytime in concord massachusetts or cheyenne wyoming but focus on the individual remove from what stein call the daily life every day during those moment when a person appear to transcend him or herself
it be in such discontinuous moment that man as emerson choose to call this generic as well as transcendent human being be true to himself not only to his nature but to nature when in become that he contain all nature inside him
only then do one fully possess a sense of oneself a consciousness of one s self as something entirely different from one s workaday existence
begin with the equation of man and nature in his first book nature emerson ground his idea of nature so thoroughly in his idea of man that in effect there be no nature for him that do not have reference to or indeed take its form from man
wilderness as nature untouched by man signify nothing for him other than as a irrelevant historical fact because he would not countenance a slovenly sprawling nature without the touch of man on it no tennessee that is without its stevensian jar
the extent that nature do sprawl be just another sign however pathetic of man s inescapable presence
despairing of much that he have formerly champion but still fortify in his central equation emerson could ask in his late essay fate why should we be make up of the same element a nonhuman universe might pose the threat of a irreconcilable difference for be human we sometimes forget that we be also nonhuman
alternatively we might feel threaten by the similarity it would mean that we too be not human
in either case the only sufficiently human response to such a threat would be to embrace it not in the manner of christ but after jacob wrestling at peniel
nature whether human or nonhuman emerson insist be the same as man whether human or nonhuman and it be only arm with this equation with its absence of calculable element that one might hazard the unknown and the hitherto unknowable
william james s transformation of psychology from philosophical colony to independent science his brother s arduous unsettling masterful novel of consciousness gertrude stein s reinvention of america and american in the name of a distinctly american language these be all expression of the same bravado
they be variation emerson be continually prophesy man stein have merely to point to herself
although she too combine a profound suspicion of the self with a unrepentant individualism she could write about herself more readily than emerson do
however discontinuous her sense of self she still know that she be complete his prophecy
in call for liberating poet emerson have in effect liberate the poet and stein could thus afford to be less disinterested in her language than either emerson or william james because she have learn from them the full extent to which language have its use both as something to be make use of and as something that often unavoidably make use of us
primarily in the powerful discontinuity of his rhetoric and in the way these contribute to the intensity of his writing emerson come close to the sense stein have of language as a living move act entity
one have to respond to and come to term with it almost as if it be another person
when use of the term self emerson call the poet s song his new self he certainly mean to suggest something of this
only he go on to idealize the poet s relation to language characterize the poetry as the poet s progeny and a heavenly progeny no less
his relation to his own language inasmuch as the essay be a kind of prosepoetry be actually much better serve by stein s description of poetry than by his own on which hers be base
the poet he say be the namer or languagemaker name thing sometimes after their appearance sometimes after their essence and give to every one its own name and not another s
this be all very well but it tell us remarkably little about what the experience of such naming might be like
the experience as we see it etch everywhere in emerson s own writing be concerned stein announce in her lecture in america with use with abuse adoring with replace the noun
one have only to examine emerson s daily waltz with the self to see how this work
it be the way that writing work in stein s life the life she write about that make her autobiographical project so much like emerson s
there be more to this resemblance than the peculiarly unfinished style and the generally incomplete nature of their works more even than the fact that they develop similar critique of the unitary self at the same time that they construct whimsical yet often deadly serious authorial self
what they chiefly have in common be a particular relation of the life to the work
where they differ be in the way this relation have be generally understand while emerson s work have be elevate to the status of a necessary myth dwarf his life stein s own work be rarely read yet her life be gigantic sheer overwhelming
it have be say of emerson that no biography can be write of his life because he live that no account of the event in his life can begin to do justice to the strength and strangeness of his writing or rather the event that count in the life of the writing be the act of write themselves
the writing be alienate from the life as it be normally and narrowly understand
the sole biography that would live up to the standard of emerson s own work would be one that not only acknowledge that his writing be always a kind of autobiography but which insist that what he have to say about himself whether directly or indirectly be always about himself as a man writing homo scriber
the writing must not be reduce to psychodrama whether freudian or otherwise if we be go to do justice to either the man or his work
one importance of emerson lie at least in part in the way he make us recognize both the strength of our psychologizing tendency and the necessity of restrain them
still not all psychologizing be of a piece
there be in essay whose title natural history of intellect stein echo in the geographical history of america be the mould into which everything be pour like warm wax and be it astronomy or railroad or french revolution or theology or botany it come out peter
the exhilarating thing about such subjectivism be that as emerson note in the same essay every man be a new method and distribute thing anew but because what be new quickly lose its novelty when it be repeat this particular form of individuality need always to be accompany by the denial of system if it be to remain original
it take method to restrain method and in this case only a fragmentary style will remove the personal from the methodical
the personality of the observe subject be thereby consume leave what emerson elsewhere would call one s character in full possession of the field
when on the occasion of a early lecture on francis bacon he praise bacoll s detached observation emerson mean by to suggest that there be no objectivity no way of sequester one object from the embarrassing variety this be from the lecture art in essay first series and look at it as somewhat foreign from natural history of intellect that be not fragmentary
for both stein and emerson the true test of character and of one resistance to a subjectivity that identify everything as one s own and lay behind all form of systematize be linguistic
only at the grammatical level of put word next to each other and shove the language around which stein observe in her late autobiographical text war i have see be what enable the american to appropriate the english language for themselves and finish the business of the revolution might one partake of a alternate subjectivity that resist any conceivable fixing of identity
in poetry and grammar one of the lecture she give in america stein explain that the only activity that have be the diagraming of sentence which she describe as a experience of completely possess something and incidentally one s self
it be this contingent grounding of the self in language that constitute her entirely emersonian response to emerson s own quietly astound description of thought as a stream in natural history of intellect which james would put to such good use
in my thought i seem to stand on the bank of a river and watch the endless flow of the stream float object of all shape color and nature nor can i much detain them as they pass except by run beside them a little way along the bank
but whence they come or whither they go be not tell me
only i have a suspicion that as geologist say every river make its own valley so do this mystic stream
it make its valley make its bank and make perhaps the observer too
to understand what stein be do with the incidental self she present as a author one language that is as exclusively grammatical but along more emersonian and rhetorical line as activate by it
she be always a moving target cross over and under bridge make of word
more readily than the emerson of the public writing although not of the extraordinary twentyvolume journal she lend herself at one and the same time to psychological account of literature and to account that would substitute language or write for the author because her writing be always about herself and about way of remove herself from it
besides such variety of psychologizing that emphasize one s subjectivity there be also the more literally objective case wherein everything can be see as if it be a version of oneself
it be this form of make the world over that emerson have in mind when he write in a oblique commentary on the title of his natural history of intellect that from whatever side we look at nature we seem to be explore the figure of a disguised man
such anthropomorphism merely as a disguised man but as a muchsimplified version of man
emerson s insistence on complicate any idea we might have of ourselves and on draw new circle instead of rest with any particular idea of the self be mean to safeguard us against this prospect
the model of nature as a disguised man require that there be no limit to the disguise of man
the corollary that there be necessary limit to what one can know oblige emerson to posit ignorance as constitutive of the self and this hold for stein too
when she confess in war i have see that i always take it for grant that people will know who i be and at the same time at the last moment i kind of doubt it be the combination of so much selfassurance with the lingering selfdoubt and the remarkable precision of her expression in the composed and utterly deflate movement from always to at the same time and then at the last moment kind of doubt that mark her as emersonian
a intellectual man emerson write in natural history of intellect or as stein must have read it a intellectual woman
have the power to go out of herself and see herself as a object therefore her defect and delusion interest her as much as her success
she not only wish to succeed in life but she wish in thought to know the history and destiny of a woman
it be this desire to know and even to prophesy their own history and destiny that cause stein and emerson to go out of themselves and to write their history their destiny their representative life their own biography themselves yet except perhaps in the matter of degree this alone be not sufficient to distinguish them from other intellectual man and woman with the same need to know and to write
and i say there be emerson stein recall in a essay she write the modest title i come and here i be and there be hawthorne and there be edgar poe and there be walt whitman and there be well in a funny way there be mark twain and then there be henry james and then there be well there be well i be
in this account of her literary genealogy stein illustrate the chief lineament of emerson s legacy
then there be well there be well i be
the fragmentary nature of this the obvious discontinuity of the transition the american quality as it can be call of the syntax and the diction the abstractness of it these all play a part but the essential aspect be first the replacement of the past by the present there be will nt quite work and then along with this a doubt as to the very existence of the self there be will nt do i am it must be
stein then in the course of acknowledge her own indebtedness to a line of american writer succeed in foreground the absolute discontinuity between herself and them
as they be relegate to the past and with the same gesture their considerable difference iron out by a repetitive formula there be

they drop off into a writer s oblivion leave their strength for stein to assume as she will
emerson somewhere in that oblivion would have be proud of his pupil although as the original emersonian he would have have to be proud of himself for have produce such a wonder and at the same time render anxious by the suspicion that he might have learn something from her
in her variously autobiographical writing stein position herself directly against the strongly antiemersonian antiindividualist theory of literary production that find its classic expression in t s eliot s essay tradition and the individual call the effect the dominant tone of a poem in the combination of a structural emotion which the entire dramatic situation of the work provided with a number of floating feeling that the writer attach to particular word or phrase or image
eliot aim in his impersonal theory of poetry to divert interest from the poet to the poetry and consequently choose to minimize the importance for the writer of the particular event in his life
it be only a short step from this to the antiintentionalist line develop by wimsatt and beardsley a generation or so later and it be precisely this divorce of the writer from the writing that as the alternative emphasis in stein s work suggest be mean to serve as a way of limit both the writing and the variety of self that might be entertain in the writing to something more manageable something altogether less individual
when wimsatt make the perfectly reasonable claim in his essay of past moment become less and less clear as time pass it be in order that he might better discriminate between the cogently organize artistic structure of a work of literature and the mere particularity of personal moment
it be just this discrimination that stein in more than forty year of writing make a little hard to make as she try to do away with or do without both the cogently organize artistic structure and the sense that the particularity of personal moment could be dismiss as merely transitory and minor
instead she want to organize artistic structure on the basis of the particularity of the personal moment look for what one might well call cogently organize structure of disorganization or cogently disorganize construction of selfhood as be true to her sense of the difficulty a emersonian individualism the emerson of our mood do not believe in each other would come up against in the twentieth century
often the difficulty the reader be confront with in one back for relief to the more familiar complexity of our own late twentiethcentury life and it be to counter retreat like this from her terrible simplicity emerson s word from the poet that stein provide various account beginning with the lecture she deliver at cambridge and oxford composition as explanation of why she write the way she do of what it be that as she often say be bother her at different time
if these account do not exactly provide a foundation on which to build stein be not in the business of provide foundation they do serve the function of show that interpretation be possible
they get one over a threshold that have threaten to nip even the prospect of interpretation in the bud and that be about all they can do with this writing that be so foreign to the convention of both literary and everyday language
on the subject of the related unconventionality of matisse and picasso stein write in make it impossible to deny that a painting no matter how shocking actually be a painting
when matisse s la femme au chapeau the first of his work that stein and her brother leo boughtwas exhibit at the autumn salon in paris in it infuriate the public they try to scratch off the paint
it be not attractive stein observe precisely because it be so original just as the early picasso be awful ugly
they be much more difficult to grasp and therefore accept than pretty more derivative work
the painting be a bother but they do not present the artist with the bother of a refusal
""
stein however repeatedly experience such refusal with her writing
whereas no one seriously deny that matisse and picasso be painter crude or garish as their work might appear when stein send the manuscript of three life to a vanity press to get it publish herself confront with the following situation as she recall it in the autobiography
one day some one knock at the door and a very nice very american young man ask if he might speak to miss stein
she say yes come in
he say i have come at the request of the grafton press
yes she say
you see he say slightly hesitant the director of the grafton press be under the impression that perhaps your knowledge of english
but i be a american say gertrude stein indignantly
yes yes i understand that perfectly now he say but perhaps you have not have much experience in write i suppose say she laugh you be under the impression that i be imperfectly educate
he blush why no he say but you might not have have much experience in writing
it prove to be all too easy for people to refuse stein s writing by level such ad hominem attack on her somehow obvious ignorance
among the as explanation that appear in the calendar of modern letter a shortlived but highly intelligent and provocative british periodical in which stein be describe as possess a intellect so cloudy as to be literally defective
her response to the very nice very american young man in the autobiography be to the contrary so decisive that it ask to be read not just as one incident in a book comprise of many such incident but as a declaration of her own independence as a writer once and for all
it be alright she say to the young man i will write to the director and you might as well tell him also that everything that be write in the manuscript be write with the intention of its be so write and all he have to do be to print it and i will take the responsibility
""
stein s insistence here that her independence and her composition the conscious manipulation of her language be respect could well have be emerson s do
first as a woman she could count on less intellectual respect among both american and european than a male american writer would receive even in provincial england
emerson on the other hand be give a great deal of benefit of the doubt both at home and abroad with the consequence that his intention be often wildly misconstrue
but at least he be read and respect
moreover stein be mistake when she propose that the form of american writing be always the form of the contemporary english one
much as this have certainly be true of emerson s writing it be not true of her own which have more in common with the painting of picasso and the postmodernism of the s and s than it have with the work of british contemporary like edith sitwell virginia woolf and wyndham lewis
other american writer resemble the british but not gertrude stein
her alliance with emerson come across particularly clearly in the compositional history of some works that be she collect in matisse picasso and gertrude stein
this be one of five book that she and toklas publish under the plain edition imprint with the proceeds from the sale of a early picasso woman with a fan
although publish in shortly after stein write the autobiography the three piece in matisse picasso and gertrude stein date back to and 
they be write around the time she complete her blockbuster novel the making of american no novel really but the negative image of one everything a novel be not when she embark on what be to be a even long work which she optimistically name a long gay book
simultaneously as she recall in her lecture in america she begin several short book which be to illustrate the long gay book one call many many woman another five another two and another gmp matisse picasso and gertrude stein
""
in the bulk of the making of american and in her initial conception of a long well as literary
she have be busy with the complete description of something with ultimately the complete description of anything with ultimately the complete description of everything which be as she recall decade later how william james have characterize the pursuit of science
she want to describe in the early work every possible kind of human being and in the subsequent one every possible relation between human being
but instead a long gay book turn into a long gay book which be publish together with many many woman as the two short story of the plain edition matisse picasso and gertrude stein with two short story
stein begin write many many woman and a long gay book near the end of during a break in the writing of the making of american which continue until the autumn of the following year
at the same time she begin to compose short portrait of acquaintance among the first one call ada move into the apartment stein share with her brother leo
the portrait stein write early in mainly of artist she know include those of matisse and picasso that alfred stieglitz later publish in his journal camera work
in these stein try to portray their attitude toward themselves what they look like to themselves by convey the relation between what they be say and how they be say it
in lecture in america she describe her technique i say what i know as they say and hear what they hear and say until i have completely empty myself of all they be that be all they be in be one hearing and say what they hear and say
""
it be in fact these portrait and the challenge they present to her scientific project that enable stein to complete the making of american later that year although in a new mode that she would come to call philosophical
philosophy as she say in her lecture on the gradual making of the making of one stop continue describe everything in relation to other thing and begin to focus on each discrete moment when like emerson one try to portray object or state of consciousness instead of merely describe them
philosophy be thus the province of the thinginitself and kant s description would count as science
near the end of the novel which she write that fall in the course of the extraordinary portrait of the dying protagonist stein suggest that what distinguish one person from another be the way of experience anything and express that thing
the early portrait be a ingenious solution to the problem of convey a person s innermost nature for they do not require her to claim that one could somehow enter into another person s consciousness as one might with a fictional character
stein be portray the experience of someone talk and listening and she merely have to claim that the simultaneous expression of that experience might be catch in the movement of the talk itself
these portrait be quite literally verbal precisely of their relation to word as well as portrait in stein s own word
through the fall and winter of stein continue to work on her group portrait
there be a inherent tension however between her general concern to describe what any one feel act and do in relation to any other one as she characterize it later and her recent success in individual portraiture
the tension be resolve in many many woman only by end the work
the last paragraph offer a model for her dilemma it consist of a string of one which be initially relate in one form or another thus it begin any one and any one one and one and two and one and one and one and one and many and one and some and one and any one
""
""
yet it end on a affirmation of individuality the one who be the one who be that one any one be that one and any one any one be one and one be one and one and one and one and one and one and one
""
stein perfect the remarkably abstract and disembodied language of these portrait in order to rid the word of her private association and of any obvious reference to her life
leo stein s criticism as she report it in everybody s autobiography be still trenchant however
he say it be not it it be i if i be not there to be there with what i do then what i do would not be what it be
in other word if no one know me actually then the thing i do would not be what they be
stein be certainly correct when she insist that this be not entirely true and that one do not need to know what the writing originally refer to in order to get a good deal out of it nevertheless she be unable to remove the trace of the removal of referentiality but know full well that someone have remove the local reference
the demand for embodiment have not be quiet
it be because these portrait still have to be filter through stein s own consciousness that she decide in the summer of to use word that ideally have nothing in them of what she later call the quality of description
as long as the word continue to function at all descriptively not only would the object or individual state of consciousness be remove from the discrete present moment but it would necessarily be describe as it appear to her instead of be portray as it be itself
for stein no less than for emerson a person be a mode of be in particular a mode of make and get one s way and a adequate portrait would have to convey the individual s tendency or direction without objectify it that is without equate it with what be already know
that stein want to do something which seem impossible since she could her own be objection
its impossibility be precisely what interest her
after all as she explain in her lecture on the making of american she have stop describe everything only when she be at last really convinced that a description of everything be possible
just as emerson write whim on the lintel of his doorpost stein might have nail up the sign if it can be do why do it to give prospective reader some idea of the uncompromising and hardy transcendentalism they would find in her writing
the portrait compose in early thus not only enable stein to complete the making of american later that year but also open up the way for the technical innovation of and most notably in her portrait of object food and room in tender button
rather than choose word for their descriptive value she begin to compose with them in much the same way that matisse and picasso compose with she recall in one of her lecture in america i relate word then sentence then paragraph to the thing at which i be look
word she feel could be make to possess mean solely in their grammatical rhetorical and metrical aspect not as concept per se or as representation but in their materiality
the analogy to matisse and picasso be not incidental
although stein have know the two artist and with her brother collect their works since she introduce them to each other they be particularly on her mind during this transitional period in her writing
in february the portrait she have compose of them be accept for publication by stieglitz who propose to print a special number of camera work with he say in a letter date february a few picasso s and a few matisse be reproduce as illustration to accompany your text
he add you have undoubtedly succeed in express matisse and picasso in word for me in it have be at stein s own expense this be her first acceptance after year of rejection and stieglitz be accept her on equal term with matisse and picasso
sometime that spring stein begin work on the piece she call gmp although she refer to it in one letter as the long one about the paris crowd it be more precisely a account of and a accounting for the relative accomplishment of the three leader of the art world matisse picasso and herself
her faith along with toklas s in her own genius be a rather lonely affair in paris unpublished and unread as she be in a country whose native tongue be not english and where she do not move in a particularly literary circle
if she have
she would have fare no better woman be not encourage to write in the french avantgarde
stieglitz s recognition be a muchneeded boost and stein make the most of it
that same spring she the architect s table a late work of high analytic cubism
picasso have paint her call card into the composition after she have leave it at his studio as a joke she recall in the autobiography
his appropriation of her signature however be no joke
in the first place the signature be in the low right corner of the oval painting which suggest that she might have paint it
be it a representation of any work of hers of what her work might become as when people question the likeness of his early portrait of her and he say that she would come to look like it be any of her writing as superb as this be this the best she could do alternatively he could be see as define her in terms of her social relation to him rather shall as a fellow artist the kind of woman who leave her call card have a salon might buy his painting
moreover painting the others be ma jolie
in the autobiography the juxtaposition be hastily defuse with a referential appeal as we go away gertrude stein say fernande be certainly not ma jolie i wonder who it be
in a few day we know
pablo have go off with eve
the rather crude joke be that stein certainly be nt ma joke either
but if ma jolie could be decode as picasso s new mistress eve to his adam then who do miss gertrude stein refer to who gertrude stein might ask be miss gertrude stein be she the signatory of a already considerable body of literature be she the close friend of this protean artist of the early portrait she would write in the autobiography that after paint her head out in the spring in the fall out of his head picasso paint the head in without have see gertrude stein again like zeus give birth to athena and in her book on satisfied with my portrait for me it be i and it be the only reproduction of me which be always i for me
now he have paint a portrait of her signature
it be with this threat to her individuality and to her originality for if he could reproduce her so readily be she perhaps merely copy picasso s technique and the challenge she have receive from stieglitz as well as her dissatisfaction with her abstract writing style for the ambitious program of portraiture she be contemplate that stein leave paris to spend the summer with toklas in spain
she want to make portrait that approach selfportrait whether they be of other people or what she call in the autobiography the rhythm of the visible world she aim to present what be see or hear in the way that it see itself
she have therefore to begin by actively refucing which be not at all the same as refill whatever she might know through not know what i know about everything what i know about anything she assert in lecture in america and immediately follow this with a example of how the positive negation she have in mind operate and so the long gay book little by little change from a description of any one and everything there be to be know about any one to what if not be not not to be not know about any one about anything
what if not be not not to be not know about
""
""
by this succession of negative the writing be transform into the expression and the experience of the unknown what be not never be and never will be know
this be something that be entirely a matter of supposition what if and by the same token absolutely irrefutable
perhaps it only exist in the writing certainly it be a experience of some kind yet as different from ordinary experience as the world of emerson s thought it be stein s quite literal concentration on the negative that in purely formal term serve to liberate her style from the monumental and pseudoscientific rhythm of the making of american and make possible later that summer and fall the delicate miracle of tender button
the works that stein carry with her to spain two jenny helen hannah paul and peter a long gay book and gmp all flesh out this quintessentially emersonian moment of transition from a past to a new state
they be transitional both literally and figuratively instance of it and stance toward it
like picasso s portrait of her and his desmoiselles they aim to study change tease it out to portray movement without resort to the illusion the repose of either narrative sequence or the new medium of the motion picture
a few page after the new style be introduce in a long gay book with the gentle little tinkle of a tiny violent noise be a yellow happy thing and the increasing quantity of negation stein comment that she could not be say that authorise something be believe that she be not have what she be have
this indirect almost indeterminate note on her writing be follow by a correspondingly decisive statement on its own writing now i have it
now i see
this be the way
not that way
the other way be not the way
it be a tangible moment of selfrecognition when stein see her way and see herself already on it
the next sentence which open a new paragraph complete this local study of transition a lively way to call be to run and call and a lively way to stand be to stand
""
one of the effect of the shift in style in these piece be that it become increasingly hale while read them to attend to the author
it be not that contrary it appear that much more subjective and obviously write but nonetheless the sense of a stable consistent author go out the window
some kind of individual force undoubtedly remain to distinguish the actual creation from what stein in the autobiography characterize as the sensitiveness of the hysteric even if it be only the outrageous conceit that yok the style together in the first place
but stein be able here to cut her write loose so that it be no long anchor in either the personality or the impersonality of the author
she be probably note this herself when she write in a long gay book that largely additional the early style and then completely explode the later one be one way to deny authorisation
""
the point be not to deny the author s existence but to deny the claim make for any authorisation which could be ground as readily in a cult of impersonality as a personality cult
it be the sense a authorized biography for instance that stein utterly reject
another way of deny such authorization and another way of read her formula can be see in her manipulation of the title of the collection in which a long cay book and gmp appear alternately matisse picasso and gertrude stein and gmp the three titular figure be reduce to their literal character and the order of these be shift
this be surely a explosion a complete fragmentation of what be initially additive
what make for the throughness of stein s antiautoritative stance be not however that the one title be reduce to the other but that the two title continue to exist in tandem just as stein s name appear both in the title and on the titlepage
any such distancing of herself from what still have to be call her self whether accomplish as it be here or in a work like the thirdperson autobiography raise doubt about the self and about any authority derive from it again it be not that stein do away with the self or even reject it but that by exploit a formal discrepancy between the two wildly divergent style in matisse picasso and gertrude stein she be able to get away from it at least in piece like these
her doubt about the self be in fact inextricably link with the set of doubt that characterize matisse s and picasso s own work
matisse she explain in her study of picasso begin to doubt what his eye could see and picasso carry this even far in his long struggle not to express what he could see but not to express the thing he do not see that is to say the thing everybody be certain of see but which they do not really see
emerson make the same point when he observe in selfreliance that these rose under my window make no reference to former rose or to better one they be for what they be as they be and not merely to observe what be anticipate or remember one have to rid oneself empty oneself of everything one already know one have to get out of the habit as stein put it of know what one be look at
stein understand so clearly what picasso be do because he be in his painting emerson all over again
the hysterical blindness that emerson experience as a student at the harvard divinity school leave its mark on his transcendentalism with the result that his own selfdoubt as any glance at his writing will show be always tie up with doubt as to what and whether his eye could see
matisse pablo and i stein observe in a notebook she keep during the writing of the making of american do not do ours with either brain or character we have all enough of both to do our job but our initiative come from within a propulsion which we or instinct or intuition all emerson s word be another version of the aboriginal self only invoke in a terminology better suit to the twentieth century it be the same deep force that be address in selfreliance to which all involuntary perception be due and which paradoxically guar
antees one s individuality by insure that one s perception of anything be as much a fact as the sun itself
place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which animate all whom it hoats emerson preach in the essay he call spiritual law and you be without effort impel to truth to right and a perfect contentment
your constitution he add would then organize itself as do now the rose and the air and the sun
stein share these conviction with him but what he propose as a way to live she develop as a way of writing a part of life whereas stein be much quicker to incorporate the minute particulars of life into her own writing
yet for both of them if life be essentially something that be write it also have less to do with the peripheral and particular activity of writing than they would have like
it be finally this alternately diverging and converging movement between life and writing rather than any distinct concept of life or writing that they share and which make for the commerce between them
the lack of connection then between life and writing be not they both rather desperately hope a sign of a deep repression of a deep yet still too shallow connection but simply a consequence of the impermanence of any connection one might make
it be not that there be none but that every connection be temporary a placeholder
the essential thing be the making of connection not the connection themselves
the best explanation of what one be do in writing be therefore to be find as its own explanation as stein suggest both the reader and the writer be free to make their own connection and to draw their own conclusion
but they could only exercise this freedom within the constraint of try to understand how the composition might be explain in its own term how it would explain itself and the impossibility of ever get this explanation exactly right be what enable the writing to live on in any particular account of it
the writer s experience in the act of composition the reader be in construe such a act these be alternate explanation of the finished composition itself something that although it have no existence independent of these activity at the same time transcend them and remain distinct from them just float float up there
for stein as for emerson a theory of life be necessarily indistinguishable from a theory of writing and if to a more british more orderly mind this must signify a cloudy intellect cloud above everything literally figuratively that speak most profoundly of the life of thing and of the permanent flux and of the writing on both side of the wall

wordsworth and the enlightenment nature man and society in the experimental poetry by alan bewell yale university press 
wordsworth s great period poem four essay by marjorie levinson cambridge university press the contour of masculine desire romaticism and the rise of woman s poetry by marlon b ross oxford university press 
a historian of the past twenty or so year of literary criticism assume anyone be willing to take on that job might conceive of it as the time when textuality triumph when the force of deconstruction successfully storm the bastille of monolithic meaning by demonstrate that all writing whatever its pretension be prolific with trope unstable decentered in a word literary
the historian could go on to describe how the professor of english in effect colonize other university department
he would show that anthropologist philosopher and in some case scientist be compel to give up of the power language have to expand divert and even to dissolve socalled literal meaning
everyone in the university it seem have to learn to read all over again and as the pupil of the advanced professor of literature
suddenly there be nothing and no one outside of the text
a primary exhibit in our historian s case might be richard rorty s splendid recent book contingency irony and solidarity
there rorty besides do many other thing extend his critique of foundational thinking by endorse philosopher such as william james nietzsche and wittgenstein who have be selfconsciously provisional speculative and sometimes even playful in their claim
these philosopher have give up on the goal of get it right once and for all and buoyantly admit the contingent status of their reflection
they aspire for their book to be useful that is to make experience available in some relatively new term that their reader might themselves profitably put lot different from people like keats wordsworth whitman and frost all of whom can be see as introduce some unexpected subject trope and rhythm into poetry in a effort to refresh language and so perhaps the thought and life of reader
and this be the best that philosopher ought to hope for as well
rorty look forward to the time when philosophy will be willing to resign its aspiration to become the queen of the science the role kant aspire for it to play and surrender on honorable term to literature
rorty s hope might provide the sort of dying fall on which a book devote to our critical climate could come discreetly to a close
but the story that book tell would be at best a partial one
plato say that the struggle between philosophy and poetry be already old in his time and it would be presumptuous to think that we have terminate it in ours
in the past twenty year the language of literary criticism have fiction accept more and more term from the analytical discipline
as it frequently happen in the political world a sort of reverse colonization have be take place the empire strike back
to call a literary critical study authentically interdisciplinary nowadays be to pay it the high compliment
what that compliment usually mean be that the work in question have succeed in translate the language of literature repeatedly into the term of more generalizing and accordingly more stable area of knowledge
""
for whatever people like de man and derrida and even rorty may affirm about textuality large category usually philosophical in origin eventually emerge to discipline the textual disorder
de man s dialectic between theory and undecidability derrida s opposition of the metaphysics of presence and difference and too rorty s contrasting category the essential and the contingent at least partially restore the sort of conceptual framework that each writer set out to dissolve
in a chapter title the contingency of selfhood offer the view very close to shelley s that cultural change result when one invent vocabulary capable of vitally renew experience displace another that have grow inert
rorty s own style a fluent and clear style that blend the sensibility of attic ironist and american adam be a fine alternative to most of what be available now on the critical market
but rorty also have frequent recourse to the traditional philosophical language of category the sort that his book argue we ought to give up on
write philosophy be perhaps inseparable from work to confer aura on particular word the major philosopher choose new and surprising one their epigone add a little to the lustre and disappear
a more literary prejudice be well express in frost s observation that after you have repeat a truth a couple of time it become less true
say it with any frequency and it will nt be true at all
on this subject oscar wilde be charmingly extreme when people agree with me i criticism play itself out between these two tendency between concept and trope stability and motion
i would suggest that in this the moment of the interdisciplinary and despite the professed affection of critic for difference the seminal adventure of the trace and all the rest the practice of submit literary writing to category particularly of a moral and political sort be at a alltime high
philosophy department may be on the decline in some american university surely they be in great britain but this may only be because philosophy as such be now operate out of the local department of english
why have this taken place why have literary criticism allow itself to be so thoroughly infiltrate by the academic discipline which it appear to have supersede what motivate contemporary criticism s quest to expand analytical vocabulary and with them to draw out the truth of literary text truth about which literature itself be frequently conceive of as be innocent or selfservingly ignorant
marjorie levinson s wordsworth s great period and marlon ross s the contour of masculine desire all profess to reveal something about wordsworth that common reader do nt know
a understanding of the nature of the three form of literary critical knowledge these book offer will i think help to answer the question i have ask above
perhaps too because these critic be all relatively young as well as be talented and energetic their work will allow us to guess at some of the future direction literary study could take
levinson s first chapter on tintern abbey have according to paul cantor in a recent issue of south atlantic quarterly already become a classic in the field of romantic literary criticism
surely levinson s reading of wordsworth s great selfreflective poem do epitomize a shift in the way many of the member of the young generation of romanticist be approach their subject
behind fearful symmetry northrop frye s book on blake and geoffrey hartman s wellknown essay on keats be to autumn and the hyperion poem the conviction that in some sense the romantic poet be still out ahead of us
frye believe that literary culture have yet to understand the truth of blake s comprehensive view of the imagination hartman that the sort of naturalistic humanism keats arrive at in his last poem might still cure contemporary aspiration to transcendence
both critic write in style beholden to the author they endorse attempt to transfer voice as well as value into their own cultural situation
now late into his career frye can still say almost everything i know i learn from blake
""
to levinson as to many young romanticist the time for such identification be go for we no long live in a world on which the romantic metaphor have much bear
it be the distance between the romantic and ourselves the argument continue that permit more detached and revealing reading of their poetry than the sort that hartman and frye could manage catch as they be in the romantic ideology
in the case of distance allow the critic to locate the repression that produce the poem s sublime intensity
what precisely be this repression and what be the new knowledge purchase at the expense of alienation that enable levinson to see into the life of the romantic poem
what be block out of tintern abbey as levinson see it be material reality and most particularly the reality of class conflict
on the day that wordsworth set his poem july the abbey s ground would have be full of beggar miserable and homeless who live by solicit alms from the middleclass tourist exercise their sensibility on the ruin
the air around the abbey would probably have be darken by the smoke of charcoal fire the noise from the town ironwork busy casting cannon for the war with france would have grate against wordsworth s somber meditation
the cottage plot that wordsworth take note of be green to the very door because the common land have be enclose some householder to cultivate be his tiny front garden
we be bind say levinson to see that wordsworth s pastoral prospect be a fragile affair artfully assemble by act of exclusion
""
the strange mixture of meditative calm and extreme urgency that have intrigue reader of tintern abbey and have frequently be assign to wordsworth s intimation of his own mortality here receive a more material explanation
to the question pose by her student which levinson say help get her inquiry into wordsworth go where be the abbey in the poem the essay reply that it be repressed relegate to the poem s political unconscious
the primary poetic action levinson write be the suppression of the social
""
perhaps the essay suggest romantic poetry the poetry of the inner self be nothing more than a middleclass effort to evade the press of too many people the claim of society one s responsibility to history
perhaps critic who that evasion in the present like wordsworth s the blindness of the romantic critic might stand as a testament to the horror of contemporary exploitative capitalist culture from which they too be compel to turn away with the full force of repression
in levinson s analysis the homeless people exclude from tintern abbey become by the power of implication our homeless and those among us who sustain the romantic ideology of inwardness stand indict
perhaps the most eloquent statement of this position remain walter benjamin s without exception the cultural treasure one survey have a origin which one can not contemplate without horror
they owe their existence not only to the effort of the great mind and talent who have create them but also to the anonymous toil of their contemporary
and then the famous aphorism there be no document of civilization which be not at the same time a document of barbarism
""
levinson s implication that repression lie at the center of the romantic project both concur
the contour of masculine desire though take the repression of femininity to be the crucial issue
ross s hypothesis be as he put it that the romantic ideology of the strong poet develop out of fear of the feminine
but he continue in attempt to assure their own sociopolitical strength by cast out and smooth over the feminine romantic poet only manage to repress the feminine which return with the full force of desire in many form
just as levinson use recent development in marxist thinking to know more of the romantic class politics than they know themselves ross be draw upon contemporary feminist study to see more clearly into the romantic anxious desire to repudiate femininity
ross s focus on the strong poet call to mind harold bloom and oddly enough ross be in a certain sense a bloomian critic
follow bloom ross read romantic poetry as be awash in oedipal strife filial rivalry and the uninhibited worship of power model themselves after the military conqueror entrepreneur and statesman of their day
in say as much he seek to give the bloomian view some historical support
throughout the book s first half in which ross reflect on the construction of the romantic poetical character he take bloom s anxiety of influence quite literally except that he condemn the creative agon that bloom with a few reservation peculiarly his own celebrate
the contour of masculine desire be a sort of bloom moralise
be it possible to disagree with critic like ross and levinson critic whose voice be so selfassured and whose ethical imperative so admirable for what make levinson and ross impatient with the romantic ethos be of course what they take to be its appalling social cost
if as frye and others have argue romanticism be rightly understand as the internalization of the quest romance with the poet however implicitly take the part of the questing knight then what about the role automatically assign or class themselves have no access to the quest inevitably they will be leave out repress in levinson
s parlance or they will be stereotyped to serve the need of the unfolding fiction as ross believe woman be in most romantic work
if romantic poetry be in its essence a testament to white male bourgeois power how prescient it be from this perspective for lewis carroll to call his parody of resolution and independence the white knight s song and if we still live to some degree within the romantic ideology then the work of demystification that ross and levinson undertake must be of crucial importance
in what better way can the professor of romantic poetry contribute to the spread of social justice and how could one criticize the political strategy of ross and levinson without oneself be justly accuse of serve repressive interest
one might i suppose question the subtlety of ross s reading of the romantic and especially wordsworth s ross for insist on the centrality of the question
keep within the freudian vocabulary then it be worth point out that wordsworth s attitude to femininity be better describe as a matter of ambivalence than of repression
in the ruined cottage which be probably wordsworth s first great poem f xxr leavis think it his fine overall it be clear that some part of wordsworth identify passionately with margaret the woman who pine away and die of grief for her missing husband
margaret be someone who can nt let go
she perish because she will not surrender her attachment to the past her drive to recover what wordsworth in regard to himself would describe as the glory and the dream
margaret be akin to those poet wordsworth describe in resolution and independence as begin in gladness with a preternatural capacity for joy
but the danger be that they will come as a direct result of that early passion to despair and madness
such figure appear margaret but of lucy of dorothy in tintern abbey of the winander boy the child of the great ode
these figure inevitably woman and child be wordsworthian image for the source of poetic power
and yet the poet also know that a full identification with any of them could end tragically
it would mean live almost entirely without defense
thus the proliferation in wordsworth of figure of chasten wisdom armytage in the ruined cottage the old leechgatherer in resolution and independence the cumberland beggar the discharged soldier in the prelude figure who seem so stoically selfreliant as to be nearly invulnerable
one approach to wordsworth would involve a careful tracing of the dialectic between his figure of passion and of restraint for wordsworth be movingly restless in his desire to conceive and conceive again the question how do i go on living defend myself against the extreme susceptibility of a figure like margaret but how do i continue too to have without that sensibility what we would recognize as authentically wordsworthian poetry would not be possible
the poetry that come from the mouth of character like armytage tend to be neoclassically sententious as when he say to the young narrator of the ruined cottage preformatted table
but that be only one strain of wordsworth s voice
wordsworth s major poetry live in the dialectic between spontaneity and defense joy and stoicism margaret and armytage
to claim as ross do that the feminine be repress in wordsworth be to blunt wordsworth s subtlety in the interest of a contemporary cultural polemic
if this highly abbreviate account of wordsworth s dialectic do bear on the truth about the poetry shell it be also the case that as many others have notice wordsworth s major work arise from time of intense inner strife moment when whatever mean be at the poet s disposal for figure the self no long suffice no long provide access to experiential or poetic vitality
the movement at those time s key figure have both a naturalistic and a allegorical dimension
steven knapp speak accurately of wordsworth be have replace the formal personification of the eighteenth century with
""
""
quasiallegorical hut ostensibly natural figure
such a movement be comparable to the one effect in freudian therapy with the crucial difference that wordsworth will concede to no one s term for represent the drama of the inner self but his own
so understand wordsworth s poetry be a poetry of performance and of process unfold throughout his great period
every major poem rewrite the last one and too all of those that come before
such a perception be make less available not only by a critic like levinson who read major works chapter on michael intimation and peele castle follow the one on tintern abbey in isolation but by wordsworth who eventually organize his poem thematically and not chronologically for publication
what i be say be that the inward turn the allegorization of the human figure be probably little less so
to observe then that wordsworth repress history run the risk of make a trivial point for what autobiographical writer in his or her moment of most intense inward turning do not wordsworth believe as many people in the west have for some time that severe introspection be the chief mean by which the self can be transform
such introspection therapeutic in its intent may well be a prerequisite for effective action action which can but need not be of a public nature
and one might here offer a freudian point keep in mind that any critic who make extensive use of the concept of repression which freud call the cornerstone of our theory be if only temporarily a freudian critic to be effective in the public world one need to know the difference between anger at political injustice and resentment against one s neglectful father between the present and the past
this be something that in the white knight s song the poem continually betray his own intense fear of inwardness a fear that wordsworth continue even in the present to provoke
one might plausibly on political and ethical ground reject the west s faith in introspection and the cartesian insistence that the individual subject be the primary arbiter of reality
the critical objective then would be to refigure the self in more comprehensively social term
and one could easily see such a inventive procedure begin with a critique of wordsworth begin but not end there
it be possible too that a critic even after have accept the rapid characterization of wordsworth s ambivalent relation to femininity that i offer above might decide that it be still in the interest of his or her reader and student to continue to demystify wordsworth s image of femininity
for surely if wordsworth allegorize his woman figure then he do to some extent stereotype them
and perhaps such romantic stereotype do inhere in
yet a critic dispose to such demystification need to take into account what one might call the rule of critical compensation to the degree that you read a text analytically to the degree that your terminology encompass it claim to know the text better than it know itself to that degree i think you give up the possibility of be read by it
wordsworth continue to challenge us ask among other thing how much we have turn against our own capacity for vital joy
for be blindly with one s blessedness at strife be to wordsworth almost everyone s inescapable lot
it be the ability to be interrogate by transfer power onto great writing that the analytical reader sacrifice and such a reader ought to think carefully about whether the exchange be worth it
in this context one recall that narcissus s response to his many wooers in the time before he fall in love with his image in the pool be simple and abrupt i will die before i that result from find a critical position that will fix the truth of romantic writing once and for all be akin to the power that people have seek for some time from philosophical system
if the essential drive of romantic writing be to impose masculine hegemony or historical repression or anything else for that matter then romanticism can come at last under the control of concept wordsworth yes we know what he be all about
but a more accurate way to understand romantic writing i think be to recognize it as be itself historicist always strive to render experience in such a way that it can not be assimilate to existing normative principle or to those that be likely to arise in the future
surely one can say that wordsworth at a certain point in his career do stop changing do let go of his dialectic
but the part of wordsworth that respond to the press of event with new invention still persist transferred i think into those critic of romanticism who have understand that no stabilizing analysis will do romantic work justice
harold bloom s criticism be authentically romantic not because it exclude female experience or because it ignore historical pressure both of which it do and at least as i see it to its detriment but because it be speculative and surprising and answer romantic invention not with philosophical stability but with more invention
bloom be nt out to get romanticism right once and for all but to perpetuate its energy
yet of course the academy and the culture at large demand cogent teachable truth and ross offer a demonstration of how a way of think as apparently inassimilable as bloom s can in time become something with which one agree or disagree rather than something that one can use as feminist critic like sandra gilbert and margaret homan have or forget about
bloom say somewhere that he be a comic critic who seem condemned to get serious review and ross s seriousness like levinson critic have after all uncover a determining repression each have arrive at the somber truth about what make wordsworth and the romantic in general what they be
the theory of repression the dutch psychoanalyst xxj h van den berg write be closely relate to the thesis that there be a sense in everything which in turn imply that everything be past and there be nothing new
apply a theory of repression to wordsworth then be a effort to relegate him to the past to literary history
he be someone who can nt surprise us anymore
but as freud himself come very close to admit wield the theory of repression put the interpreter in a head i win tail you lose situation
if the subject agree with the interpretation the interpreter must be right if she disagree well how could she not freud do give the patient a out she could disagree calmly enough to persuade the therapist that he be mistake
but can offer no rebuttal to the charge of repression
other reader who would counter the charge be naturally repress themselves
with one word ross and levinson could dismiss the argument i have offer thus far
once someone make central use of the category of repression no real critical conversation be possible
what one face then be cultural politics by fiat
and here it be worth make a distinction between ross and levinson on the one hand and a new historicist like stephen greenblatt on the other
greenblatt s recent criticism focus on the way that energy circulate fiom cultural production into politics and social life then back again
he claim for example that king lear rework material give to it by contemporary controversy over exorcism and that the reworking have a bearing in the public world
lear do nt repress exorcism that would be to swallow the subject tip make it disappear with only the most oblique trace
accordingly greenblatt s text constitute a interpretation a story one may may say that his fact be nt fact at all or that important one have be neglect a few have
but at least one may disagree propose another story
a reader win claim to uncover a determining repression be attempt to achieve what one might call the interpretive sublime a act not quite transcendental but rather descendental in that it seek penetration to ultimate depth rather than contact with a deity who reign on high
of course it be a open question as to why after the like of william james and jacques derrida one can still claim codlike power of penetration in a critical text
what be it we might ask that could motivate this rather outdated and dictatorial claim that romantic poetry be a function of repression and thus a thing exclusively of the past what be at stake in assert that wordsworth do nt know enough or could nt force enough through the veil of repression to be a creditable poet in this a more comprehensively aware to see the historical critic claim to a large knowledge than the romantic possess within the tradition of critical response to romanticism
for the charge that the romantic do not know enough be of course a familiar one
the famous passage from matthew arnold s the function of criticism run as follow
it have long seem to me that the burst of creative activity in our literature through the first quarter of this century have about it in fact something premature and that from this cause its production be doom most of them in spite of the sanguine hope which accompany and do still accompany them to prove hardly more lasting than the production of far less splendid epoch
and this prematureness come from its have proceed without have its proper data without sufficient material to work with
in other word the english poetry of the first quarter of this century with plenty of energy plenty of creative force do not know enough
do not know enough to translate that famous phrase so that do not know enough become have repress too much
levinson speak revealingly at one point of the wisdom sic of our own moment that very wisdom wordsworth could not in produce
the bestknown inheritor of arnold s sentiment about romanticism be of course t s eliot who castigate romantic poetry for be fragmentary immature and chaotic as oppose naturally to classical work complete adult and orderly knowledgeable as well no doubt
with arnold and eliot as with levinson and ross criticize the romantic for their ignorance in contrast to some stable principle of knowledge be inseparable from a desire to serve culture by propose normative ethical and political value
i be argue then that the drive to cultural stability matter much more than the value conservative for eliot and arnold ostensibly progressive for levinson and ross in whose name the critical process be carry out
and levinson and ross in be hostile to the romantic no one who wish to set a myth of concern frye s phrase in place be go to have much use for emerson or shelley or for a great deal of what wordsworth write either
the description i have offer thus far may at first seem to be grossly unfair to two talented and learn critic who take themselves to be on the left not like arnold and eliot at all
surely it make difference to align oneself however critically with the tradition of marx
arnold and eliot be critic of the middle class and overall not displease with that fact
but to what degree be ross and levinson and indeed most member of the cultural left writing today authentically marxist when the student who get levinson s critical project move by ask her where the abbey be in the poem become graduate student they may ask her another question on the building and ground theme where be the university in your analysis of criticism that seem devoted to leftist politics rarely if ever address the institutional situation from which they arise
in richard ohmann publish english in america a book that view professor of english as a class and reflect on their productive function within the prevailing capitalist economy
ohmann argue that the profession function ideologically for university professor of english
to him our immersion in scholarly writing in various learned society in conference in the compilation of bibliography and the production of authorized edition serve to disguise from ourselves and others the reality of our social role
our real task ohmann believe be to serve capitalism
we teach student to write clearly and to abstract the meaning of text to be punctual and obedient in way that will directly serve the need of the corporate world
we take pain to choose those student who will join the elite and to eliminate the one who for whatever reason would not fit in
all of our professional exertion divert us from recognize such a simplistic one for one thing there be surely a more dynamic exchange between the economic and the professional task than he admit but it be also immensely provocative
in this moment of leftwards turn in the academy it would seem logical to start refine ohmann s view and take up the practical politics his book enjoin
something comparable have be go on in the critical legal study movement where duncan kennedy and others have be write what amount to anthropological critique of the tribal custom of the law school and the legal profession while offer lots of suggestion for reform
but this be not happen in any dramatic way in the department of english
as william cain write in a recent retrospective piece on ohmann english in america remain the first and last of its kind its concern judge to be important but apparently not compel enough to merit far study
why one wonder have this happen
why indeed
in very little of the work from the cultural left as a professor of english one must be sustain by and help sustain a culture that be take to be exploitative racist and phallogocentric
few professor if any seem to be write essay enjoin their colleague to cease dispense grade surely a form of classroom capitalism or to stop write letter of recommendation to objectionable corporation those continuing say to reap profit in south africa or from the sale of weapon
nor do anyone seem particularly interested in abolish the hierarchy that preside in english department hierarchy that can at time make the vatican look rather freeform
the kind of left criticism that one encounter in ross and levinson and all through literary study now be not in marx s sense political
that is it do not concern itself with material but with ideological issue
such criticism be i think open to the charge that marx make in the german ideology against the young hegelians since the young hegelians consider conception consciousness to which they attribute a independent existence as the real chain of man
""
""
it be evident that the young hegelians have to fight only against these illusion of consciousness
inevitably there will be a philosophical or conceptual dimension to any marxist work
but hannah arendt be also right to say that marx s impact on western thinking derive in considerable part from his reverse the standard philosophical view that hold the life of the mind to be superior to the life of action
from the marxist perspective cultural criticism unattached to plan for material transformation count as nothing better than a attempt characteristic of all idealist philosophy to solve the world rather than change it
at the point where one turn away from praxis as the cultural left in america largely have and try to provide culture with some useful ethical and intellectual standard then even if the preferred term be commonly associate with marx the project be far more in the spirit of arnold
it be also her determination to get a vocabulary in place that will help people to live better one that will also last
arnoldian criticism have be accurately describe as the process of make literature available to the use of culture and that be what ross and levinson attempt to do
the best concise romantic rebuttal be probably blake s one law for the lion and ox be oppression
""
but why should ross and levinson and so many other critic in their thirties and early forties write in what come down to a arnoldian spirit why do this generation of critic so clearly prefer truth to performance philosophical criticism to critical extravagance in his conception of wordsworth and the enlightenment alan bewell have something close to a ideal chance to write criticism that both praise invention and itself exemplify the inventive drive
bewell s learning enable him to see just where wordsworth s poetry participate in enlightenment anthropological discourse and by far the more important point where and how wordsworth renew what the tradition give what be in the writing of the philosophe abstract case study of outcast into narrative about human being whose dignity be comparable to the poet s and the reader s
thus bewell see wordsworth s depiction of female isolate such as goody blake and the mad mother as revise the enlightenment discourse on witchcraft render former object of persecution in sympathetic way and so enlarge the number of different kind of person that his reader can think of as part of the human community
and bewell argue in these woman wordsworth find image for his own imaginative working
bewell s wordsworth be alive to the issue of gender and concerned to reform the class politics of his day though grant he be not in every way our contemporary
but to wish him so would imply as julian barnes s narrator say in flaubert s parrot a disturbing lack of selfconfidence the present want both to patronize the past by adjudicate on its political acceptability and also to be flatter by it up the good work
""
bewell s book be genuinely historicist work attempt to take wordsworth in his own term and to complicate our sense of his relation to the enlightenment
the book show what wordsworth do for example to recast enlightenment treatise on idiot on wild child and savage on the origin of religion on natural history on human attitude toward death
in do so bewell be work in a mode eloquently commend by milan kundera in a recent harper essay without criticism the discovery effect by art go unnamed and thereby remain absent from the history of art for a work enter history and become visible there only if its discovery its innovation be specify and recognize
without the mediative background that be criticism works become isolated gesture ahistorical accident soon forget
""
bewell be a formidable scholar as one would have to be to undertake his task
be it ungrateful then to observe that he give us a rather enervated portrait of scholar a servant to the logic of the next step dutifully revise and revise his wordsworth offer a critique of the enlightenment a carefully work out response to its practice and value
and often what be most surprising and move in wordsworth disappear in bewell s book into carefully construct intellectual history
for wordsworth do nt just put forward a alternative to enlightenment value as a politician might put forward a reform bill his poetry convey the energy that could aid a reader who would transform and truly humanize the human science of his or her own day
the problem be naturally commonplace among comprehensive scholar like bewell
frequently the labor of learning require to speak accurately about where a writer actually depart from his or her context condition the scholar s mind to the belief that all mental action must take the form of gradual unfolding
the scholar have trouble conceiving of a mind that work more swiftly and intuitively
goethe be to the point thought expand but lame action and
mate for the kind of criticism that frost be endorse not without selfinterest when he talk about how critic should take some pain to see what a feat it be to turn that that way and what a feat it be to remember that to be remind of that by this
the perception of such feat be inseparable from authentic literary pleasure and that be tie up i think with the ability to delight in change to accept the fact of time s inevitable modification of who and what we be collateral with the wish however futile to be imaginatively out ahead of time
such literary pleasure which come down to the pleasure in trope in the large sense of that word be something for which ross and levinson and alas bewell as well have little use
pleasure have be in rather poor repute among academic student of literature for some time of course
in lionel trilling feel compel to publish a essay in defense of literary keats
conceive the situation wherein the somber trilling become pleasure s most prominent advocate among the critic
since that time foucault have force us to ask if there be any form of pleasure available to human being that have nt already be codify by the normative discipline
even erotic pleasure foucault imply have be so extensively survey by the various discourse of knowledge that it can be neither innocent nor subversive
rather than provide a release from the burden of a determinate self sexual act of however eccentric a sort may serve merely to consolidate the subject and thus reinforce power dominion over him or her
a comparable suspicion of the pleasure principle seem pervasive in academic literary criticism at present and for a number of reason
the story be frequently tell of how cleanth brooks keep the english program at lsu alive by demonstrate to the dean with copious use of blackboard diagram how the new criticism he have help to devise be a coherent cognitive discipline not unscientific at all branch of knowledge with a place among those other form of know that make up the liberal art curriculum
to thrive as a university discipline the study of literature have to look as serious as its competitor and if possible more so
the current rage to be interdisciplinary be a rage to get more term on the blackboard to purloin if possible some respectability from the other department
as each hungry new generation of critic tread its forerunner down new term new abstraction get add to the game
and of course the quickest way to move out ahead of one s critical progenitor be to say that they have be mystify too soft too idealize in their conception of literature
one thing that have certainly aid this process whereby to speak broadly philosophy have get the upper hand on poetry be the disappearance of a culture of informed literary journalism
edmund wilson for example be extremely good at challenge brooks and company s pretension to scientific authority creditable journalistic counterweight have now disappear in its place we have the angry muddled response of a hilton kramer
to be malign in the new criteria be to a literary academic proof that his or her critique be hit home
the makeup of the english department have also change significantly
freelance critic like blackmur jarrell and delmore schwartz be eventually absorb into university literature department but their presence there effectively blur the border between the academy and the large reading public
now all the critic in the english department hold phds
have be through the mill they have exclusive control of its engine
such a shift help set the scene for develop a professional culture well insulate from the public and possess its own language rite and hierarchy
within that culture the pursuit of pure critical knowledge even if it be what wordsworth fear knowledge purchase through the loss of power can go on largely unchanllenged
what other trend might be inspire this critical recourse to more matter of institutional or professional politics it be very difficult to say
trilling would probably have ascribe the phenomenon to a drive for negative transcendence
what be at stake as he see it in get beyond the pleasure principle be the hope of arrive at a position of superiority in culture a position from which have be liberate from every interest one might speak with complete detachment and therefore with complete authority
in a culture teeming with image that promise total bliss the total repudiation of all image and all pleasure be perhaps a understandable reaction
then too energy that transcend individual design might be in play
hegel of course could conceive of a time when mankind would outgrow its need for art
freud in his turn reflect on those happy few the scientist who have full access to the reality principle and do nt need their instruction gild with delight
that scientific type might in time as philip rieff reflect become the norm even in its working
perhaps contemporary criticism with its polemic against esthetic pleasure be merely keep pace with culture s overall movement or perhaps demystify criticism be in culture vanguard that anyway would explain its strong attraction to young and talented writer such as ross and levinson
and yet it be wordsworth himself who speak of the grand elementary principle of pleasure observe that it constitute the native and naked dignity of man and that it be the principle by which a person know and feel and life and move
in wordsworth s poetry the principle of vital energy of pleasure be name lucy and margaret and the winander boy and it have restore and invigorate for nearly two hundred year
wordsorth recognize a trend toward freezing abstraction in his own cultural moment but he do not see its triumph as inevitable and he set his own best poetry against it
still there be something even in wordsworth that fear the vital presence enough to kill around he succeed in do away with it for good and the sane and lifeless voice of armytage come on to infuse the poetry of the next fortyfive year
armytage be a admirable personage stoical detach dutiful and morally beyond reproach
but by himself he be nothing like a genuine poet
nor be he a ideal critic either
by mark edmundson
the english poet craig raine dedicate his recent book of essay haydn and the valve trumpet to karl miller without whom english letter would be dramatically poor in recognition of a lifetime s dedication to literature
those who admire miller critical writing elegant alert exceptionally toughminded as well as openminded will recognize the aptness of these word to a writer who have studiously avoid the limelight and have not always have the recognition he deserve
the sense in which english letter would be dramatically poor without him include of course his work as a editor a occupation in which distinction be specifically earn by avoid the limelight
in the year through when he be successively literary editor of the spectator and the new statesman and shell editor of the listener miller preside over a transformation of literary journalism that bring to the art of review a new standard of exactitude responsibility and liveliness
it be during his time and at least partly under behind the homogenized anonymity of a olympian house style which have provide a characteristic note of mandarin metropolitan reviewing in britain begin slowly but fairly surely to go out of business
this occur not only in the journal he edit which for the most part need the change less than some others
but the impact make by his early work as a editor remain vivid to me
i still remember from the late the conscious act which make me buy the spectator not a paper i would normally have think to read because of the quality of its review page unstuffy wittily aggressive with a new forthrightness a freshness and independence of style and of thought
what strike me most be a quality of professionalism of decent scruple in matter of both fact and opinion without loss of readability
among the reviewer to whom miller give a national forum be frank kermode and christopher ricks
he be especially good at enlist the skill of professional academic among others to address a reading in expertise a feature now take for grant in the best review paper on both side of the atlantic and probably owe more to his early editorial work than it do to any other single person
for this alone he be a preeminent figure in the history of british literary journalism
as the founding editor since and as coeditor with marykay wilmers since of the london review of book he have create what some think of as the lively intellectual paper in the englishspeaking world
his new book author be variously link with that paper
many of the essay in it first appear there and many of his critical exchange whether agree or dissent be with other contributor
that the chief impression this give be not of narcissism but of a live traffic in opinion be a index of the quality of personality and of mind both of the author and of the journal
there be in addition a concluding chapter entitle literary journalism which contain his reflection relation with that not exactly uneventful time
it begin in at a time when the luxuriance of british bookreviewing have be trim by a lengthy strike at time newspaper
it begin when margaret thatcher begin her reign as conservative prime minister and when the social democratic party begin and when the rule of the ayatollah khomeini begin in the middle east
there must have be those at the time who think that none of the undertaking in question would last for very long
the sdp have since merge with the liberal but mrs thatcher and khomeini go on in their anger to dominate these ten year both of them holy terror of a kind with a air at time of the interminable and the london review be still appear
the paper be launch during the year when the tls the bestknown organ of highlevel bookreviewing in britain and perhaps the only one at that time with a genuinely international reach be silence by industrial action along with the time and its be some dissatisfaction with the tls which until the mid maintain the practice of anonymous reviewing by then widely feel to have outlive its time
the new york review of book have demonstrate that a market exist for a strong reviewing paper whose contributor announce their responsibility for what they say instead of lose themselves in or shelter behind the pseudoimpartialities of faceless punditry
by the later john gross have gradually introduce sign review into the tls and begin to make more extensive use of the long reviewessay at some cost to the rapid and wideranging coverage of very large number of literary and learn works which have be a special usefulness of that paper but with gain in readability character and accountability
these change be under way at the time of the stoppage and they continue after it both under the editorship of gross and that of his successor jeremy treglown
the tls have since develop in way which have i believe benefit from the stimulus and competition
when the london review step into the vacuum create by the strike it bore very much strong resemblance to the new york review than the tls ever do
these be not only matter of physical format and of general editorial conception long thinkpieces no short review
many of the contributor write regularly for both paper and for a time if i remember rightly british subscriber to the one automatically receive the others nestle within its bulky parent like a baby kangaroo in a pouch
the london review still look like a small or slim down version with fewer ad and some might think more disciplined wordage
one of the feature of the new york review which presumably have a special appeal for miller be its assumption of a public with a serious interest in all form of literature imaginative and learn m the life of intellect in a wide sense of the term a sense which especially include politics not necessarily partisan but not necessarily nonpartisan either
in the great nineteenthcentury quarterly on both side of the atlantic some of which survive into later time but as shadow of their former self
a catholicity that include politics in close and natural interaction with other matter of literary or cultural concern be amusingly reflect in miller s insistence on thatcher and khomeini as preside and monstrous presence in the inaugural decade of the london review
it would be wrong to say that the blend of politics and intellect imply by this ideal be confine to the nineteenthcentury review and go out with them
miller see it as have survive on a reduced scale in a number of paper including the three early paper he work for
my own experience of journalism have always lie in the field of small paper interest both in politics and in literature in the behavior both of ruler and of author and it be to this field that i be mainly refer when i use the term literary journalism
the three paper i work for early be all of this kind of a ancient strain in british journalism a strain which precede the arrival of masscirculation newspaper and assist in their creation
this be to hark back to a time when there be a general knowledge which could be call by the name of literature and which a journal might hope to publish
such paper be distinguish from the little magazine specialize in a branch or genre or faction of literature and eschew politics
but they have in the nature of their presentday format and circulation be restrict in their scale of attention
though commit to the range of interest miller describe they have usually not be able to provide the space and context for extended piece write with specialist excellence for reader who be not specialist and care about excellence
it be here that miller look back to the nineteenth century before specialist become a institution and when some author write on many subject with a specialist authority and in particular to the early of the great review closely associate as up
i have suggest that what we do have be do in the past
at the start of the nineteenth century the edinburgh review embark on a achievement which have not be forget id literary journalism and to which the practice of the old new statesman for instance be in certain way intimately relate francis jeffrey s journal can be read and admire to this day for its earnestness and impudence its politics and letter its wide spread of subject on either side of that division and for its argumentative long article
these be feature which have go we have like to think to the making of the london review
we have try to make a hook of each issue which be indeed the length of a book and we have want to carry essay as opposed to notice and to be as sparing as we could with the irresponsibility of the opinionated and unsubstantiated short review
this be a approach which appeal to writer who want to make a book of their like a death warrant to many a working journalist
for good or ill book have already be make of article in the paper collection by individual author as well as anthologized selection
the world of the edinburgh review have already be evoke in miller s first book his cockburn s millenium a study of the scottish judge and man of letter henry cockburn who be a friend and biographer of francis jeffrey the editor of the edinburgh
that book like the present one have a certain autobiographical dimension
it also show a early stage of miller s interest in manifestation of the double life a theme to which he devote his next big book of double and which remain pervasive in author in which cockburn also make a brief appearance or two
in some way author be a sequel or at least a pendant to double for example in its exploration of romance and restraint in richardson and the memoirist commemorator of lady mary wortley montagu but here appear mainly as the author of several other interesting biographical works of racial duality particularly in a sharp and vivid study of xxv s naipaul of the textual duality of pastiche and the interaction of past and present and the psychic state they express or allegorize in the novel of peter ackroyd of similarity and reciprocity in the works of kingsley amis and philip larkin of kingsley amis and martin amis of philip roth and saul bellow and of the polymorphous roth and his alter ego zuckerman
in some of these discussion miller focus especially on the question of whether and in what way biographical information contribute to the reading of novel and poem
the choice here may in a sense be one between know more and know less
should amis s friendship with larkin which go unstated in amiss fiction but which be not absent from it matter to the reader of that fiction the report that eliot to me it be only the relief of a personal and wholly insignificant grouse against life be no more a licence to treat the poem as totally and unreservedly autobiographical than it be a conclusive estimate of its significance
but the report be worth know by those who want to know the poem
this be typical miller language flatly and with conviction address matter of inherent complexity or hot debate
it be conviction without dogmatism both firm and openminded refuse simplification and also refuse to be overwhelm by the nonsimplicity of the issue
it underly throughout this book the whole question of author their presence or absence their relationship to their creation their responsibility for what they write
the case of paul de man come up several time and we know where miller stand but there be no cheap shot though specialist in the latter do themselves too much honor will doubtless count this as one
in later life de man be understand to he say that not exist
and there be those now who appear to want to understand this as a way of say that the author of over a hundred collaborationist article do not exist
this come in a essay actually entitle author which take up the mythology of the death of tile author as itself answer to a cultural need a ploy that try to outface the fact of a unexpended interest in author
author be take to be inspirer exalter disturb exclude
they be absentminded awkward
their huge wing prevent them from walk about
and they be cause determine deceive
according to freud they be ill
according to barthes dead
these be among the thing that we have need to think of author and they have often appear to indicate what authors undoubtedly suffer from in their effort and anxiety in their pursuit of tile imaginary
but they be thing that be wrong and right with them peculiar to author who have tend to place a undue trust in restrictive account of their activity
they have abdicate and abstain while also figure on occasion as specialist in the restrictivegrandiose
pseudonymity and its irony often deeply political be part of the theme of author in particular the recent case of rahila khan a reclusive asian woman whose book of story deal with generational conflict within the asian community in britain be about to be publish by virago but be find to have be write by a leftwing feminist antiracist anglican vicar call toby forward a real name which look like a pseudonym
when forward come forward according to miller s account a virago spokeswoman say he pretend to occupy a space that be nt his
""
""
apparently untouched by the thought that this be what novelist be mean to do and may even succeed in do
virago have a point which be nt altogether that pen name release me from the obligation of be what i seem to be so that i can write as i really am
this be what he mean when he say rahila khan be me
not everyone will follow miller either when he say this may not be very different from what flaubert mean when he say the same thing of himself and madame bovary since madame bovary be nt be present as the author of the book
but one may salute the sarcasm which add that the only harm that have be do be the bruise administer to the theory that author be separate and do not matter
when his cover be blow virago decide that the identity of their author matter very much indeed and proceed to make out that there be something the matter with him
try the idea that author be separate and do not matter on for example salman rushdie whose case risk put the death of the author on a allow for and to whom miller devote some moving paragraph
he then tell of a oldstyle critic he meet when he first visit london one of the literary moralist then function as the profession s inspectorate who tell him that dylan thomas who have be kind to miller be a shit
miller comment that the distinction between author and critic be now rightly contest among literary theorist who believe that critic be author and there be now few friend for the idea of a barely readable inspectorate which tell writer how to write and that they be shit
this if it be not all sarcasm may seem a shade optimistic
the barely readable inspectorate still rule ok though its word have become long
there be sort of author whom miller as a class find it hard to take than others some of them trade author the label be distil from uppishnesses miller have at various time discern in the literary milieux of the eighteenth or less at one with other people and whom it can often seem that only a great willingness would be willing to worship a comment charge with the muffled deadliness of a lingeringly delay jamesian precision
then there be fernanda eberstadt mention in miller s moving and witty chapter on primo levi who in a essay in commentary on this great writer and survivor of auschwitz find him want in jewishness but who elsewhere praise the antisemitic gustav herling because he give her a sense of a man talk to god whether or not she have talk to god miller never one to underestimate the competition conclude she have certainly be review for him
""
miller be evidently inhabit by a jamesian double
it have many voice
here it be engage with barbara everett herself no slouch at the convolution of a refined indeterminacy and with her way of leave
indefinite the point at which or frequency with which the use of biography deserve to this good thing this knowledge can be use to tell us for example that amis be not a tudor writer but she be rather more move to say at the same time that it can nt or can hardly be use devoted as she be to the thought of a separation between in this case amis s friendship and politics his life and his art
miller be a extraordinary stylist in the precise sense that his style be unlike anyone else be even where it play at be like james s
he be a specialist highly selfaware of the spacious circumlocution in which leisurely abstract phrasing be harness to remarkable precision delicately labor or suddenly curt
he also pack a great concentration into colloquial idiom of a sort flat than james would normally use and he sometimes practice a dialect of thrusting indirection for which i know no analogue as when he write on the indirections of journalist in the opening paragraph of a chapter on the polish reporter go to foreign country where there be trouble and collie back to write book in which they say that it be hard to make out what be go on
when they say this they be apt to be call writer
writer do nt know what be go on
but they can be good at convey what it be like for them to be there and to be write it down
the journalist to whom i be refer can more solemnly be say to be practise a modern art of indirection of the unintelligible and the interminable
it be as if the war crisis living hell or chaotic backwater can never be know and will never end
after a while you fly out
it be a civilized oblique style with a bizarre precision of the unspecific both detach and engage ironic and amusing but also with a unparaded fervor that express exactly that concern with the role of write in human affair politics which miller describe as central to his all its understated elegance be not without shock tactic and which sometimes bite sharply and deep
this be a wise delightful book
it cover a wide range and anyone might pick small quarrel with its information or its manner
the story of don quixotes changing reputation from madman to for example sympathetic hero might have be enrich from stuart tave s the amiable humorist
victorian do as miller say object to richardson s indecency but so do his own contemporary including fielding even as richardson go on pay him a more conventional version of the same compliment
some point usually verbal one be make to do heavy duty and some linkage in the chain of argument or fact seem strenuously contrive
these be the small quarrel
i have no doubt that some will have large quarrel with this book and i take this to be to its credit
it combine the virtue of journalism and scholarship in the best sense of both and some liking
one or two have already say so
book of essay other than by the inspectorate be by general report hard to sell
but if any be worth buying this be it
by claude rawson
author by karl miller oxford university press 
since i have live in new york i have like walking avoid subway or taxi whenever i can
these day i usually walk from my apartment in greenwich village up to midtown on the east side to eat a amble about three mile long
there be plenty of restaurant in the village but none quite like those just above the united nation in the side street of the fifties
they be french but not fashionable food be still prepare with butter and lard and cream the patron be bulky and comfortable the menu seldom change
the restaurant be in the ground floor of townhouse and most be do up alike a bar in front lead to a long room line with banquette of red plush or red leather sundaypainter oil painting of provincial france hang in gold frame on the wall above the banquette a kitchen tuck in the back
people say new york be a cold city and i suppose any one of these restaurant could be cite in middle age lack that air of reassuring familiarity tourist like
but the restaurant be fill with people seemingly quite content to be leave alone many regular solitary client as well as couple speak quietly
to reach the french restaurant i have to pass from my house through a drug preserve just to the east of washington square
ten year ago junkie use to sell to junkie in the square and the block east to third avenue
in the morning stoned man lay on park bench or in doorway they sleep immobile under the influence of the drug sometimes have spread newspaper out on the pavement as mattress
it be then the sort of scene which might have attract baudelaire s spleen
in a prose poem of he describe a poisoned group of worker
this languishing and pine population
""
""
who feel a purple and impetuous blood course through their vein and who cast a long sorrowladen look at the sunlight and shadow of the great park
in baudelaire s he encounter aggressive beggar and spontaneous fight his lapel be grab by man sell watch while his pocket be pick by man steal them
these disorder stimulate his muse
the civilized man must somehow account for pain he can do nothing about
the dulled heroin addict now be go replace by addictdealers in crack
the crack dealer be never still their arm be jerky they pace and pace
baudelaire s inflamed poetic voice no long conjure a observer s impression of their woe for the sight of these human being whose body be shortcircuiting while disturbing be not too disturbing if i also keep move
along third avenue abruptly above fourteenth street there appear six block or so of white brick apartment house build in the and on the edge of the gramercy park area the people who live here be buyer for department store woman who begin in new york as secretary and may or may not have become something more but keep at their in a american city drink casually in bar alone or dining quietly with one another these woman of a certain age woman who do not attempt to disguise the crowsfeet at the edge of the eye for generation the block here have be their shelter
it be a neighborhood also of single bald man in commerce and sales not at the top but walk confidently enough to the deli and tobacco stand line third
all the food sell in shop here be sell in small can and single portion it be possible in the korean grocery to buy half a lettuce
by modernity baudelaire write i mean the ephemeral the fugitive the contingent the half of art whose other half be the eternal and the immutable
gramercy park be a community of refugee like so many other place in new york but here there be refugee from the family
these be emphemeral life one might say their daily round consist of little bit of and feed cat in the evening
most of the imagery of anomie isolation and estrangement of the nineteenth century assume that solitude be a urban affliction
the image of a mass of solitary middleaged people in characterless apartment building still might conjure a pathetic picture
yet there be lots of people on the street in this swath of third avenue at all hour though hardly fashionable these block skirting gramercy park be in the companionable spirit of constantin guys
here solitude seem to enhance the ordinary business of life
unfortunately in a few minute of walk this scene too have disappear and now my walk take a unexpected turn
in the middle twenties between third and lexington be the equestrian center of new york where several store sell saddle crop and western apparel
the clientele be vary polo player from the lush suburb argentine people who ride in central park and then another group more delicate connoisseur of harness crop and saddle
the middle twenties play to these leather fetishist bar in rundown townhouse with no sign and blackedout window
what make the middle twenties distinct be that all the customer in the leather shop be serve alike rudely
saddle and whip be sell by harassed salesman wrap by clerk ostentatiously bored
nor do the horsey matron seem to care much where the man with careful eye take their purchase no curiosity about the blackedout window from behind which ooze the smell of beer lather and urine
this indifference set the obsessed free
the first modern school of urbanist be establish in the united state at the university of chicago around the time of the first world war
these chicago urbanist most notably robert park originally a journalist whose visual impression of the city come from investigate crime accident fire and political demonstration seek to understand the relation between the city as a place and as a moral order
people who be outsider they first thought be likely to benefit from the the defective nor the genius have the same opportunity to develop his innate disposition in a small town that he invariably find in a great city
deviance be the freedom the city make possible
but a community of single middleaged woman also deviate from the normal connection between family and community immigrant who barely speak the language of native deviate so do political radical so do black and hispanic
be one to add up all the deviant population in many big city deviant would form the majority
thus park in his later writing like his young colleague louis wirth move away from conceive of the city as a place permit difference but rather as a place of difference generate them
its moral order be the lack of a moral order which exercise hegemony over the city as a whole
and indeed these fragment enter into the life of every urbanite so that he act out in wirth s phrase a number of segmented to difference place to place activity to activity take on the coloring of each scene like a chameleon
by virtue of his different interest arise out of different aspect of social life the individual acquire membership in widely divergent group each of which function only with reference to a certain segment of his personality
the teacher of these chicago urbanist the berlin sociologist georg simmel have begin to influence his student through a famous lecture give in about defense against the outside
its title be die grossstadt und das geistesleben which translate as the great city and spiritual life
these man who be breed on report crime in the chicago stockyard find write about the spiritual life of city slightly uncomfortable at least in the abstract manner in which their teacher conceive of it individual spirit struggle with impersonal collective form
they seek a way to translate the spiritual life of the city into concrete fact
in part they substitute the word subjective inner life a little less highflying and more a matter of personal perception
but this do nt take them very far as social analyst
the word they find which seem the key to make translation between the spiritual and the material be difference and in seize upon this word they begin to diverge from their teacher
difference connote to park and wirth experience of otherness surprise and stimulation to be have in a city a person experience otherness will respond positively inside if only emphemerally by temporarily take on the color of his or her surroundings
vivid inner life occur in the experience of these passage
the chicago urbanist feel the urban dimension of this process to lie in particular in the fact of density population distribution boundary between different population center where difference in population become overlay in a compressed territory
by crowd human difference together the thick impasto of experience ought to give urban life its vitality
they do not imagine urban dweller could define the complexity subjective awareness and vividness occur as individual move between community and come to accept human being as partial provocation of one another
thus do encounter with stranger life in a crowd exploration of difference all take on a positive value for these social researcher
des geistesleben life of the spirit translate into daily experience of impersonality
and in this the sociologist look at industrial chicago somewhat as baudelaire have look at the paris of louis philippe nearly a century before the city offer in its concentration of diversity a milieu in which individual could get outside of themselves turn their subjective life outward
the smell of urine be perfume if only i keep walking
in the upper twenties bag of spice lie in rank within the shop run by indian and pakistani when the door be open in spring and fall the combined scent waft out to the street but like most of the ethnic enclave in new york these sensuous sight and smell be not few of the bag of spice be identify by label
this brilliantly simple expedient discourage all but the most intrepid of tourist who upon ask for a explanation of the mysterious bag will be smilingly inform by perfectly polite shopkeeper that one be hot spice or another a imported ingredient
the shop owner stand in their doorway in summer make joke or comment could it possibly be about us which their neighbor meet with the faint parting of the lip the slight smile which acknowledge more and perhaps condemn more than a loud laugh
new york should be the model city of the urbane dream it grasp the imagination because it be the city of difference par excellence a city collect its population from all over the world
yet it be here that the urbanity of the parisian poet and the chicago sociologist seem contravene their hope for a truly modern civilization which have not become reality
by walk in the middle of new york one be but precisely because these scene be inward turning they seem unlikely to offer themselves as significant encounter in the sense of a vivid engagement a telling moment of talk or touching or connection
the leather fetishist and spice merchant be protect by disengagement the admirable woman who have make life for themselves near gramercy park be also disengage not those needy sort of american who feel they must tell you the entire story of their life in the next five minute the junkie do business be seldom in a mood to chat
all the more be this true more largely of the race who live segregated life close together and of social class who mix but do not socialize
a walk in new york reveal that difference from and indifference to others be a related unhappy pair of social reality
difference do not interact
the city often remind me of the neglected studio of a painter who have assemble all the paint book of other artist and sketch he will need and then unaccountably left town
the promise of urbanism as it appear in the great industrial era remain unfulfilled
instead of provoke engagement difference coexist with indifference
here be one effect of personal space in which the outside be neutral and do not arouse
this coexistence of difference and indifference be most evident in the last lap of my walk which pass through murray hill
the townhouse here be dirty limestone or brownstone the apartment building have no imposing entrance lobby
there be a uniform for unfashion in murray hill elderly woman in black silk dress and equally elderly man sport pencilthin mustache and malacca cane their clothes visibly decade old
this be a quarter of the old elite in new york
the quarter like to depict itself as a dying neighborhood aristocracy bury by loud man civility crush in the hand of people who have the temerity of their vigor
in one way the manner of murray hill simply mirror those of the spice merchant a dealer in tumeric and the senior vicepresident of a bank at least brother in silence
but old money have refine the display of indifference
the center of murray hill be the morgan library the library house in the mansion at thirtysixth and madison of the capitalist whose vigor appalled old new york at the turn of the century
the talk at blacktie dinner here be dull the morgan do not glitter
some few of the man at morgan library dinner will go to the century association nearby for that sort of exercise or even far afield to the grolier club
the century have chamber music concert art exhibit and evening lecture at the grolier there be bibliophile chat the dinner at the morgan evoke the aura of civilized discourse without a taxing expenditure of thought
at the table set under the library s dark oak beam dwarf in the architectural volume of xxj xxp morgan s swagger people speak cozily of child and of their friend divorce
near the morgan a enormous store regularly open in the evening so that people could shop after a day of work
often one would see woman of the sort who live nearby in gramercy park shop for sheet there the sheetshoppers have clip the advertisement for a white sale out of the newspaper and carry it in their unscuffed calf handbag they be hardworking thrifty
i have as i say often see them stop after a round of shop to contemplate these other woman in their unfashionable dress and jewel in old setting the man in their worn dinner jacket enter the portal of the morgan library the door open and close by the aid of flunkey within so that those about to dine need not push
there be a moment of hostility on the street perhaps cloud in the shopper eye by surprise at how shabby be the permanently rich and then a slight shrug of the shoulder
in one way the negligence of the diner at the morgan to their circumstance be thus mirror at its between circumstance place and person there be only a neutral connection
the shopper shrug accept and like me move on life will go on
this oil of the mechanism of indifference be not the machine of power itself
instead the display of indifference be how the eye see power at work in space
in walk the street where people go about their own business we be constantly witness scene of submission in which the actor think they be simply keep to themselves numb to the fact that true negligence require a privileged place in society
submission pass through power s magic lantern so that the image illuminate on the city s street do not irritate the eye
submission appear on the street as detachment
if what one see hurt one can always keep walking
to tocqueville this would have be perfectly comprehensible
that shrug be a gesture of individualism
now i have sight the restaurant
the east forties between lexington and first avenue be the most anonymous area building in and out of which junior diplomat at the united nation move their child and their chattel as government at home rise and fall
each month office tower encroach upon residential tower a marriage of tower in the sky that blot out the sun on the street
on the periphery of the city one can see literally mile of burntout or abandoned ruin the building often with brickedup window or window cover in sheet of metal behind which at night one spy gleam of light this permissible belt of desolation in so rich a city be like a boast of civic indifference
here in the very center the building especially at night have their own derelict homeless air the remaining townhouse more like provisional structure than dwelling a hundred year old as they be so obviously slate for the wrecker s ball
perhaps the most profound conviction modern people have about modernity be that it be complex
the technology of the modern world be certainly more complex than that of any global become more multiangled
the era of the ism at war capitalism nationalism socialism have end and peace have produce a political map whose road be too tangled for professional racer ever to follow
complexity be our most cherished cliche
and yet to the extent this cliche tell a true story it have a unexpected denouement
social economic and political complexity produce experiential withdrawal dissociation and lack of stimulation
material complexity do not produce a culture of vividly feel difference
difference fail to work subjectively
a complex society do not arouse a engaged inner life rather it erect a divide between social reality and personal reality
the social realist may attack politely the lady with her bag of sheet stand outside the morgan library implore her to recognize what be really happen
but she feel he have attack her that this social realism about the outside threaten something within her something which resist engagement
she have keep faith with herself
faith social realist do not understand that this be why she resist his truth
in political study the value of difference be express as the ideal of pluralism
negotiation between the mosaic of different race class and ethnic group have be conceive under the banner of pluralism to knit the city together
each interest group will give a little to gain a little the process of exchange will distribute the good of government in bit to all
this be the liberal ideal of the american author of the federalist paper in the eighteenth century and of libertarian like tocqueville and mill in the nineteenth
by now it be clear that these partial plural exchange be much more likely to benefit politician than their constituent some large principle than the deal be necessary to cope in any decisive way with racism in school income inequality or crime
pluralism however be more than a philosophy of deal
it implicate in country like the united state or great britain the value of difference continue to persist after immigrant have settle
more largely it suppose that a society will draw life from the diversity it contain that the exercise of human right for instance will become meaningful to a society when these right be accord to group of people radically unlike another rather than simply privilege which apply to people who be pretty much the same
right acquire its weight by be able to cross the boundary of different custom sexual preference or religious belief
the chicago urbanist have a clear idea of how in a city difference should hold people together
they imagine the city to be like a magnetic field in which each class race religion ethnic group occupation sex preference and age be a molecule all these charged difference hold together in a dynamic tension within the field
but if difference lose its reality its charge its energy then this field of force will not hold
if a jew do not care to understand no serious effort to negotiate their hostile difference between them be only the possibility for trivial accommodation
the liberal pluralistic ideal which be a simple and noble ideal even as it be corrupt political practice suppose that people could take one another as seriously when they diverge as when they converge
this seriousness bind them together
but what if these very difference make a faint impress then the force of right be weaken the gravity of the right to free speech be weaken if the mind can not conceive what this right would mean equally for catholic moslem and jew for fascist communist and liberal for educated people who speak clearly and uneducated people struggle for word
this be why the value of personal space be urgent politically because they depoliticize the mentality of people not by advertising or easy manipulation but rather by create a complex and unhappy subjective life which be so much rich than the emotional universe envision by liberalism so much more compelling
even guys baudelaire also conceive this annulment of difference
guys be a dandy stimulate by difference
baudelaire see other man on the street figure who in the midst of the noise and jostling seem wrap up unhappily in themselves
from contemporary america he draw a arresting image of these figure wander paris they seem like indian of the american forest and plain wander among the camp and town of the white settler
the difference the indian encounter the engine box of processed food and manufactured clothes do not arouse them rather they find the spectacle depressing
here be evidence that they be a doomed race
and baudelaire think these indian become more uncertain pass among the sign of modernity that anything within them could hold up against this world their rite their cosmology have less command over the world than a box of processed food
they turn ever more within themselves the member of the doomed race in ever great uncertainty about their own spiritual life and with think similar tribe could be see everyday on the rue de rivoli disguise in white skin velveteen jacket and top hat
we need to find in modern culture some secular form for the valuemaking human capacity religion once channel
without this discovery we be indeed like baudelaire be doom indian lack the energy to resist the neutralizing force of domination
and it be only through a spiritual life that transpire without the assurance threat ancl governance of god that a social ideal like pluralism could ever make sense a ideal in wllich difference itself be value in which complexity become life
the writing of graffiti literally scratching can be see on manmade brick wall as old as those in hierakonopolis from around bc word graffiti have traditionally take two form
one be doggerel like that see in urinal more or less amusing more or less obscene but where the message be easily understand
the other form of wallwriting be secretsafe in public
the sikns a place be secretsafe writing a chalk square mean a place be risky or a cross within a circle that you will be give food by these people
prison graffiti be make more elaborate by the compound effect of so many prisoner write on the same wall decade after decade
in his prison diary from the second world war victor serge note that
the wall speak
to the careful eye every surface reveal sign
""
""
scratch in with a pin or in dark corner in thin pencil line xxr be as if the throllgs of man throw together by prison need only thirty word and a phallic symbol to express the essence of the suffering in their life
at first glance the cell be empty silent sepulchral
but after the first five minute every square inch of wall or floor have its tale of woe to tell
""
""
""
you soon grow tired
""
""
tired of the constant repetition of the same misery
the place and read his wall no matter it be in extremis that he write these crude impersonal sign
in one way the word graffiti do by slum kid in new york beginning in the s break radically with the wall write that have come before it
there be nothing discrete or covert about it as both tramp and prison graffiti be nor be it do in private place like urinal
huge number initial and nickname identify the writer appear inside and outside subway car insignia make with can of pressurized spray paint and felttipped pen
neither obscene nor political as in the s poster just name write everywhere
the scale of this graffiti be what at first make the impression so much of it and so much of it be big cover door and window and bench back and metal plate of subway car the functional part of these wall ignore all cover over as surface on which to write
from the wall of subway car the name and the fixed wall be similarly appropriate
these endless or monster label might be rather grandly describe as the making of a theatrical wall the subway car treat as a neutral backcloth to be bring to life by dramatic gesture in paint
the kid be indifferent however to the general public play to themselves ignore the presence of other people use or enclose in their space
there be a great deal of ponderous writing about this graffiti as a art of the oppressed and the critical hype tend to lose touch with what these kid be do declare who they be on object which be then repaint scrub or break up so that the declaration disappear
these be aggressive crude juvenile mark of this be me meet by adult hostility
spray graffiti in paint or scrawl it in mark ink across the wall and the subway car of new york be treat from the first as a crime
the kid also treat it as criminal activity
it quickly write to steal their can of paint and marker
many of the material then become illegal
for instance a marking pen with a twoinch wide brush be the first tool kid use to write their street name or identify number on move or stationary wall it be quickly take off the legitimate artsupply market as be its successor a pen with a halfinch felt tip
to do large form of writing either thrownups a few giant letter on the outside of subway car or piece anything from cartoon character to depiction of one s entire family the writer used can of pressurized spray paint
eventually the manufacturer change the design of the spray paint can to prohibit the drawing of thick line make antique spray can another valuable commodity on the black market
crime give to both side a little electric charge this be real
as the paint and pen become criminalize so be entry into the yard where subway train be store
of new york strew with glass and beer can home to drifter who pry open the door to sleep and shelter to young people who have no place to go to make love
some of these yard be ollt in the open at the edge of the city but others be subterranean beneath the city s center like the storage pit under the brooklyn bridge where at three in the morning you could smell sausage cook over the fire the drifter build at the edge of the track and hear over the sound of the crackling occasional sex moan frorll other car but almost nothing from above the hustling suit on wall street still asleep far away
when graffiti come the yard be gradually close up with fence at one point the police use specially train dog who patrol the yard prowl back and forth between a double fence but now the everhungry expensive dog be go like the drifter and the lover without bed the train be enclose in fencing top medieval wall these at last protect the urban instrument of speed from writing
these graffiti be innocent of obscene message or political message or indeed any message save one fecit i do this this mark be me i exist
in their form usually number like or camcam ii they be impersonal sign but apply everywhere these mark seem to capture the space for their maker
why have the surface deface with these impersonalpersonal declaration so disturbed others
here be one honest answer
i be a subway rider and while i do not find myself consciously make the connection between the graffitimakers and the criminal who occasionally rob rape and assault passenger the sense that all be part of one world of uncontrollable predator seem inescapable
even if the graffitist be the least dangerous of these their everpresent marking serve to persuade the passenger that indeed the subway be a dangerous place
""
""
""
the issue of control graffiti is
the reason people be afraid of graffiti on this account be that it be a writing of the underclass we exist and we be everywhere
moreover you others be nothing we write all over you
inside a subway rider have a good ride when nothing happen no crazy sing no beggar everyone lose amid the dirt and noise in the safety of their own thought
a new york subway car be a rueful and extreme instance of the dictum that urban difference be tolerable so long as they do not interact
it would seem that the crime of graffiti be to force others to respond to the presence of the juvenile underclass declare itself
but graffiti reveal something more than the aggression need to make others notice
these mark have a message i exist write in a peculiar way
this peculiarity become evident in how new york graffiti contrast to those of paris at the same period which be more truly impersonal
the to nineteenthcentury edict forbidding political poster
the last time there be a concerted effort to prosecute the scrawlers of slogan on wall be during the nazi occupation of the city
a ever less draconian guarding of urban surface during the last halfcentury have go handinhand with ever more orderly and restrained act of defacement
the simple difference between new york and parisian graffiti of the great graffiti era the s be that there be so much more graffiti in new york
paris graffiti of the s be usually make by stencil a image or slogan be cut out from the center of a piece of cardboard the board be press against a wall while the image be spraypainted on
since the most ordinary material be use just as they come from the manufacturer there be no way to criminalize them
even so the public in paris as well as the authority be not arouse by the appearance of these graffiti despite the fact that the slogan be frequently politically provocative and the image occasionally sexually the difference
stencil create image which be both small in size and clear in detail
the wall surface thus become a background against which the image stand out unlike graffiti in new york which cover over the wall space
indeed recent graffiti on the street around the bastille have be carefully position on the wall and different graffitimakers avoid jostle one another s territory
in this part of paris political poster be still common but the group make use of them now mostly african and iranian have also take care not to trespass on the framing space around the graffiti
these stencilled image appear mostly on fixed wall and be mean to last to become geographic to be absorb into the fabric of the city
whereas in new york graffiti the moment a tag or piece be smudge or alter the rule of the game permit other graffiti writer to write over cover it with their own mark a opportunity which be seize whenever it arise and which account of new york
the parisian graffiti incorporate the wall as part of what be to be see distinctly as frame space the new york graffiti obliterate it
the pleasure of graffiti be compulsive that of repeat the same image over and over again in different place one feel more powerful the more place one see one s mark
some of the paris graffiti thus be as widespread as camcam or in new york but the mark of identity in paris be seldom name
the stenciled image be of thing a insect repeat over and over sometimes on the same wall so it seem to swarm a banana transform into a long face wear sunglasses with the caption speedy banana next to it
on the wall of the new opera house at the bastille be already repeat stencil of razor blade to remind passerby of the guillotine and the revolutionary past here
the french graffiti writer make his presence know by a image which do not name him
unlike parisian graffiti its surface it declare the maker rather than reveal him through a mediation it make the instant act of declaration all a name move everywhere rapidly
identity become publicity
it move and it can not last
to a fourteenyearold boy whose gang have succeed in paint a entire train with their name interlace with cartoon character the act of selfdeclaration feel like this
there be a park at simon street where it make a turn and there be a big avenue there westchester avenue
people be all crowd up there in front of the store and they be look up at the train and go wow you could see the reflection in the window of the slum of the car all paint
every car be like a tv and you could see the color reflect
""
""
""
the next day i go to brooklyn bridge and i think this thing have to be together
at least five car
but they be all break up
one with a mono car and i say wow split up already oh my lod every piece be on different train
it be crazy
""
""
but that have be the greatest moment
""
""
that i have ever have
the creator of speedy banana create a amusing decorative object
the creator of this train of name do more and less
there be a pathos genuine if juvenile in his effort to declare himself
the train of name read to others as garbage
the mark of identity be render in such a way that they soon become a impasto of writeover mess or fragment of face and broken name travel at random on the hundred of mile of subway track until scrub off so much effort which have only produce more disorder more meaningless aggression in a city in which for people oblige to ride subway order be precarious and the random rule all these sign of self travel without sense
urbanite who be oblige to press themselves upon others in a place without a hierarchy of established recognition
who count who even exist these be matter which be establish in city by effort a effort usually involve struggle a struggle mobilize aggression
in a way what the shim boy do to subway man in suit do every day in office make their impress upon others the victory last only until the next bid for attention the hustling concentrate in a place in which so many people unknown to one another know they be mutually contending
this be baudelaire s paris it now be modern new york
it be what endless becoming mean in crowd there be a constant struggle for recognition which degenerate into aggression
in a city there be no smallscale rooted village existence which frame who people be the street be fill with stranger prepare to resist rather than accept
moreover the very sign of identity degenerate in our city
difference be a word which contain information as when i pass the spice shop and think that be how a indian spice merchant live in new york
but this information be not neutral
the merchant may say to his twelveyearold son who be fillingspilling for me a paper bag of tumeric how many time do i have to tell you to go slowly in hear this universal litany of fatherhood chant again suddenly i might feel the presence of the father and the son and perhaps the indian who have smile at my question and push me away by answer imported ingredient if now he notice me notice might be move by my existence as well it occur when our eye meet after look at bag and boy
what would complete our relation in this silence be a kind of mutual recognition which have occur across the barrier of difference
at the end of the pherwmerology of the spirit hegel make the connection between difference and recognition the key to ethics
recognize reconciliation between contending ego it be the yes with which both ego desist from their existence in opposition
this sentence could have be the preface to a famous exhibition of photograph mount a generation ago call the family of man in which african farmer hong kong merchant english aristocrat and american adolescent be all show go about the basic business of life work and make love and play and care for child which unite them in one human family
it might seem that the recognition which pass between the spice merchant and me mean that we realize that we too be both member of this family of man both father if father in different way
be however i to announce to the indian at this moment we be both father i would perhaps earn another of his faint smile or his son would perhaps earn another scowl the family be lose face in the presence of a stranger
and similarly be i to accost wrap to reassure him that though i do nt share his taste i accept them as just part of the human condition he might wrest his eye from the thong nestle in tissue paper to glance at me in alarm perhaps i be a cop try a new form of entrapment in order to arrest him
if not what right have i to name his desire aloud the lady carry a bag of sheet might disturb the lady enter the morgan library more by remain and stare not by call out which could be dismiss as just vulgar rudeness
if only their eye could lock those of the privileged woman would surely drop in embarrassment first
a recognition would have pass between them but belong to the same family of man would hardly be for them a matter of affirmative uplift
the ethics of recognition be knot up the way pluralism be tie in a knot how to affirm the reality of difference among stranger
the smarmy message of the family of the end none of us be stranger to each other
the family of man be like conceive a global personal space
how instead might recognition forge a social bond between people who may be necessarily hostile to one another or who do not talk the same language or can nt understand one another though they use the same word or simply have a right to silence a easy way to cut this knot seem to be simply to affirm the value of mutual toleration and be do with it
and yet as some of the graffiti writer be to find toleration have its own peculiarity in the modern world
in the faith of graffiti a glossy picture book of new york graffiti norman mailer have assign himself the graffiti name of a in the course of interview a selected group of street artist roundly declare for them all that graffiti be the herald of some oncoming apocalypse less and less far away
the art gallery be begin to seize upon this graffiti as art almost as soon as it appear by the new york art dealer sidney jani could mount a postgraffiti art exhibition at his gallery fill with painting do by a few subway artist who have find their way from car wall to canvas
money fill the opening of this show money dress down in leather jacket and jeans while the artist dress up kid in shiny suit circulate among the canape treat with shy respect by the jani buyer and with something border on paternal alarm by the black servant pass food and drink
in the catalogue of this show there be a photograph of keith haring a young white artist who adapt graffiti write to a tame scribbling which can decorate poster and tshirt as well as canvas
in the photo he be wear one of these massproduced keith haring tshirt
next to him be a dark puerto rican young man wear nothing but a cross on a string and a pair of boxer shorts his nipple ortiz widely know on the subway as la ii
just as the clothed white artist be advertise his clothes so the nakedness of the slum hispanic be a advertisement
behind them be a collaborative painting
beneath them be haring s guarantee that the buyer at the sidney jani gallery be look at something of value a statement date print in italics under the photo
because he possess quality that be uniquely human the image maker in the history of man may be more important now than at any other time
human imagination can not be program by a computer
la ii s imagination be our greatest hope for survival
la ii be look down at this announcement
he seem to be study it
the packaging of a identity like all advertising inflate the value of the human commodity it contain
graffiti be ideal for these purpose la ii s aggression against bourgeois propriety certify he have make something significant that he have make a
almost all the show of graffiti art in the early eighties in new york be lace in the gallery space by word explain the sign many of the sign themselves have become so familiar to people in the city that without the text there might have be the danger of gallerygoers assume that for some reason the kid after wreck the subway be go now for the inside of building
the gallery world s hot reaction to graffiti if seem at least so much more sympathetic than the policedogs patrol the subway yard between double fence reveal however another way of police identity one which annul the sting of its difference
the honest subway rider s confession of his everpresent sense of fear in the presence of graffiti be reverse in the assertion that the street artist be the herald of some oncoming apocalypse less and less far away
the fear be reverse so that now the attack seem something to be desire so that the naked la s imagination be of the gallery owner s name sidney jani be providential
from threaten face the poor can be make to show another face
instead of appear as criminal failure or loser they be transmute into moral superior
there be reversal peripeteia and there be the ritual work of purge
la ii s identity be give a new value the value be of a messenger of doom to be sure but what matter be that the message no long belong to him
he have be interpret
understanding what he mean a understanding writ large than his life become the way of take him over
in take him over his understanders relieve themselves of his threat they draw close to him close and sure of step
la ii and his kind harbinger of a apocalypse less and less far away though they may be have be domesticated and be now ready for consumption
thus can toleration be catch up in the process of the interest of graffiti as a extreme case be that they show that toleration can revalue the hostility of protest so that it become part of the dominant order s endless debate with itself about its own legitimacy
money can be make in this debate
yet even in the most juvenile form of graffiti there be more than the sheer effort to attract attention
there be sign of effort to contrive a expression to make a name in color to make a traveling train of name to make a form and all this be more than a matter of sheer aggression or crying recognize me notice me i be here
melvin samuels jr
whose only statement about his work be that graffiti should be amusing be a member of the death squad writing group in the south bronx and sign himself as noc 
born in he begin exhibit at the age of new york amsterdam case of the bourgeois world s need to exhibitown those who be its negation
in his case however painting proceed despite commodification
in painting like the letter exhibit in munich in at the galerie thomas noc create a painting which make use of calligraphy like the letter on the subway car of new york but be truly postgraffiti
the sprayed edge in yellow and pink of this canvas create a living wall of color the magic marker line and spray in brown and green on this wall be imagine in terms of color contrast the blackmarker write itself carefully position within a field of yellow
the writing itself be two fragment both in quotation mark one the letter announce the title of the painting the others be dream of the holocust sic so unexpected a phrase nestle on its pretty background of ochre
one search the painting to know why it be here find a halfburied brown swastika in a jutting this artist who say graffiti should only amuse mean what he have write mean that this puzzle could be a dream of the holocaust all that slick color question by the writing
the viewer believe in him far more than in norman mailer
there be actually three writing on noc s painting not two
the third be his signature but it be easy to miss discretely place at the low right
and in the photo of keith haring with la ii the puerto rican boy whose eye be cast down a little as if he might just have read the caption beneath him look dubious
perhaps like noc he be instead curious about the living wall of paint
it would be the artist s resolution good form take a artist out of himself the form become its own reality
by richard sennett
xxv s naipaul and i have perhaps two thing in common but they might disqualify us from make either a critique of the south or a critique of a critique of it we be born and rear in trinidad in the west indies and we have only a limited knowledge of the south
he leave trinidad at eighteen i at twenty two
his knowledge of the south be restrict to a visit to a presidential convention in dallas in and another visit of about four month which form the basis of his book a turn in the south
my knowledge be derive mainly from have live from to in charlottesville virginia and from observe the south since then as a americanist living elsewhere in the country who have become a american which include take on or accept my portion of the burden of the national history
in other word naipaul and i both know almost nothing about the south so my observation here will be much more in the south be the product of a tour that apparently last from midapril until august precede by a brief easter visit in which he travel from new york to north carolina
the tour take him to atlanta charleston tallahassee tuskegee alabama jackson mississippi nashville and then to durham north carolina
the end of the journey in charlottesville virginia be relegate to a brief dismissive coda but one that give more than a hint of the book s main theme
there be history there in quantity naipaul write of charlottesville jefferson monticello the university of virginia
but that be history as celebration the history of the resort the history that be cause the subdivision or house development to multiply
""
""
and be even threaten the fox hunt
""
by this point it be clear that the search for the meaning of southern history have be the book s main theme and although there be subsidiary interest naipaul s search for southern meaning
to this central theme or search three other major theme or search themselves interconnect be relate the respective place of religion politics and art in southern culture
one may well ask at once whether a travel book be a appropriate place for a investigation into the heart of a region
in some respect travel writing be a shallow form of serious literature the only form in which ignorance be pure bliss
w e b du boi once write scornfully perhaps quote someone about car window sociologist who view their human subject mainly from a comfortable distance then write about them with confidence and no doubt consequence
no matter how long he or she linger in any one place fill notebook or tape cassette the travel writer must surely be most often a car window sociologist a car window psychologist and a car window writer however plentiful or intimate be the interview or chat with member of the native mine not naipaul s
travel writing occupy a major place in his body of work as robert nixon point out in his important forthcoming study of naipaul s travel book
naipaul be highly conscious of its tradition which in english include trollope conrad and graham greene and of his own place in that tradition
almost half of his twenty or so book be nonfictional and mainly involve travel although he have set out in the beginning to be a writer of fiction
why do he shift in part he have lament the fatal loss of the power of the novel
in spite of the undoubted success of his magisterial a house for mr biswas and other splendid early work like the story in miguel street and the novel the mystic masseur and the suffrage of elvira naipaul have decide that the novel as a form no long carry conviction
at some point in his career he come to the realization that he could not be as he admit a
that my response to the world could be express equally imaginatively in nonfiction in journalism and i take my journalism extremely seriously because think it be a very fair response to my world
it be something that can nt be convert into fiction
his journalism have be of the high kind
early on robert nixon note he refuse to talk about assignment from editor instead he speak of his mission to foreign country
mission be a term from diplomacy or religion and yet naipaul s mission mainly to the third world have seldom be diplomatic and if they could be call religious then inquisition more than conversion or redemption have be his discernible goal
among his travel book a turn in the south be particularly rich in autobiographical reference that involve his early year in trinidad
it cast valuable light on some of the main factor that make necessary this shift on naipaul s part from short story and novel to book of cultural commentary or mission much a mission as a ramble something at once elegant and consider casual and lightheart something appropriately to the south cavalier
nevertheless this inquiry into the american south have to be see along side naipaul s other travel book which have be mainly about india africa and the british caribbean the dark element of the third world in more way than one
do naipaul see the south as a part of the heart of darkness which it be his mission to illuminate such a identification of the south might seem improbable until one recall the recent uproar in west virginia about a california travel agency which offer tour of the appalachian region promise thrilling visit to america s third world
the package have since be withdraw
in the old day of segregation and lynch law the south be primitive primeval gothic grotesque
with the integration of the last lunch counter the stowing away of the last lynch rope the dismantling of have become well almost boring or hardly more gothic than the rest of the country
naipaul understand this point remark of the united state in general that it be not and can not be alien in the simple way a african country be alien
it be too well know too photograph too write about and be more organize and less informal it be not so open to casual inspection
and yet the south clearly remain special for him and to him and for the reason it seem to me that it do represent some additional illumination of his large mission to the third world
the point may be underscore by naipaul s announcement here that this be his last travel book travel on a theme
""
the question remain how naipaul be able to see the south as part of the problem of the third world how his reflection on his tour of the region could have assist in further the basic inquiry that have previously take him america
after all in spite of the black capture of mayoralty here and there notably in atlanta and memphis and more recently of the governorship of virginia the south be still dominate by white and its religion be overwhelmingly protestant
it seem a unlikely place for naipaul to try out those theory concerning the nature of third world culture that be implicit and even explicit in book such as a area of darkness the overcrowded barracoon india a wounded civilization and among the believer book incidentally that have make him a disliked and even reviled figure among third world intellectual
in prize conscious britain where honor abound there be hardly a important award open to writer of prose that he have not win but in many part of the third world naipaul be probably only slightly more welcome than salman rushdie would be if he drop in one afternoon for cocktail at the iranian embassy in london
at a literary conference several year ago in his own west indies so intense that one man publicly offer to shoot him
more recently however he have receive a award which in his reaction to it cast light on our reading of a turn in the south
i refer not to his knighting by queen elizabeth ii but to his receive the trinity cross his island s high honor
this honor be not expect
the pride most trinidadian have once feel in reading of naipaul s success have long since turn into anger even to hatred of him for his criticism of their society in book such as the mimic man and guerillas which utterly reject the local version of black power
some time after the announcement of the award naipaul receive the medal in person in trinidad and it be say with no more than his usual show of discomfort
he also venture to express particular satisfaction that the news of the trinity cross award have come before the announcement of his knighthood and be even say to have remark that the trinity softening if that be what it be be very recent as i have say and for most of his critic in the west indies and elsewhere it could not begin to undo the three decade of insult he have heap on people of color around the world
nevertheless although in a heavily camouflaged way this softening be a crucial aspect of a turn in the south
give his reputation as a critic of black culture the book start off in a highly unlikely way with naipaul journey into the south in the company of two black american a designer and lettering artist and his assistant howard for a easter visit to howard s home
the idea that howard believe that he have a home be itself central to the journey for he have surprise both his employer and naipaul with his response to his boss s question howard if i have to give up and you could nt get another job what would you do howard have reply naipaul write
jimmy the employer be as strike by this as i be when jimmy tell me that howard have something neither jimmy nor i have a patch of the earth he think of as home absolutely his
and that be where many month after i have hear this story i think i should begin this book about the south with the home that howard have
this sense of wonder at howard s confidence about home introduce from the start a central element in naipaul s identity as a writer his own sense of homelessness
out of this feeling evolve much of his career as a writer of nonfiction as well as important aspect of his career in fiction
he be a man without a home in his native trinidad although most of his family be still there
early on naipaul once deny to a bbc reporter that he have ever visit trinidad much less live there
he have also steadily maintain that he be a man without a true home in or less since 
it have be strongly suggest by some of naipaul s critic that this professed sense of homelessness be merely the most essential piece of his professional costume and that it be perverse for anyone so intimately connect to england by education marriage and professional success to pretend that he be not at home there
such critic of naipaul see his alleged homelessness as mean only still far to court white metropolitans
underlie it all they see a profound sense of shame flatter to his english host at his lowly unenglish origin his light brown unenglish skin his unenglish name vidiadhar surajprasad naipaul
this may be the case but only i suspect in some roundabout way that be insensitive to naipaul s state of mind
the sense of gloom be too pervasive in his work the whoop of joy too few when so much success should have lead willynilly to at least a few whoop however discreet
i hope you be not woman tell naipaul when she hear that he be write a book about the south show that she do nt know that his most characteristic work be virtually all gloom
pleasure itself be suspect where writing be concerned pleasure and writing appear to be oppose
i begin to be aware of the great pleasure i have take in travel in the south naipaul caution at one point
romance a glow of hopefulness and freedom have already begin to touch the early stage of the journey
""
""
""
i have all but forget the writing anxiety i have have and i think that afternoon that it would have complete my plea sure if i do nt have to write anything
""
""
if i could simply be with the experience
this almost professional commitment to joylessness reinforce my conviction that naipaul s sense of homelessness be real enough it also reinforce my sense that there be a deep connection between his homelessness and what have happen to his writing
what naipaul s home in north carolina be that howard s claim to a home be in fact unfounded
it be not simply that there be a meanness about the small town from which he come it be that every important institution on which the concept of home depend prove to be contingent fragile and doom
the congregation of a black church where naipaul go to observe the service surprise and even temporarily please him
he be surprised at the formality of the service and in the idea of community reflect in it
a woman in white with a white hat get up and sing he remember
so i begin to feel the pleasure of the religious meeting the pleasure of brotherhood union formality ritual clothes music all combine to create a possibility of ecstasy
but such pleasure evaporate swiftly
it can not hide the fact that the economic base of this community be tenuous and dependent on the desire of white
howard s house the job the church even the cemetery all these factor bear for black people the unmistakable mark of foreclosure
and in a intimately related way the black past be also foreclose
no one can go back more than two generation before reach that point where darkness fall the historical darkness even here which be home
""
in this instance as in some others naipaul concede a crucial similarity between his black subject and himself
he too although of the brahmin caste in hinduism can not go back more than two generation before lose the past certain thing be lose the way for me the grandson of immigrant from india to trinidad ancestor as close as grandparent be mysterious and some unknown make it impossible to give a good answer after just a hundred year to a question like where do your people come from his link to his family s past in india however humble that indentured servitude that bring indian to trinidad in the second half of the nineteenth century to work in cane field that the former slave now disdain
his grandparent arrive in the new world the spine of their history break to attempt a new life in a place where as naipaul tell us most eloquently perhaps in the loss of el dorado which trace the history of trinidad from columbus to the end of slavery nothing happen
nothing happen because with the abolition of slavery in the british abandon the colony in spite of a continuing colonial administration as the course of empire lead elsewhere
the caribbean become a backwater
grow up in this backwater naipaul tell us here his greatest terror be of fall into nonentity
at that point in his book he associate this fear with his later feeling of taint and spiritual annihilation at see the human result of the swamping of east indian culture in martinique and belize by nonindian cultural value say for naipaul no value at all
these lost indian be new world debris
and it be out of this fear of nonentity that he derive his desire to be a writer to avoid the ninetofive job in a office and to be my own man
ironically the humane and seriocomic fiction set in trinidad on which he found his literary career be set in this place where nothing happen and be all about people who from the metropolitan center of europe must have look very much like the same new world debris from whom he elsewhere recoil
the turning point in his career come apparently when according to his judgment quote at the start of this essay the novel as a form fail him or when the people fail him as it would seem from all of his later book or perhaps when he fail them
a turn in the south suggest that naipaul himself may be begin to address move not with all deliberate speed as his critic might prefer but deliberately nevertheless
he concede a point of similarity between himself and howard s community in the foreclosure of their sense of the past and he concede too his surprise at the formality and sense of community in the black church
but he concede little else by way of sympathy here
one would have to be quite susceptible to politeness or to naipaul s craftsmanship in which stylized politeness play a decisive role not to see the hostile picture of the black southern world that emerge from a turn in the south
the truth be that virtually all the major reviewer of this book including such towering professional historian as eugene genovese and c vann woodward apparently have be so susceptible
they have praise the book without important reservation and none at all on the matter of its depiction of black
for my part i would hardly wish to dispute the accuracy of naipaul s depiction of the thinness of howard s defensiveness spikiness he like to say of almost all of the black politician and other public figure he encounter
but naipaul go far in this book so that in spite of its apparent casualness of technique its alleged dependence on accident and impulse which lead him at one point to abandon plan to visit faulkner country in oxford mississippi in favor of a pilgrimage to the birthplace of elvis in tupelo it be a highly crafted work and no way more so than in the manner in which it systematically attack the black south
of his basic technique in this book of travel travel on a theme two analogy offer by naipaul himself need to be consider
there be some film director he remark who prefer to work in natural light the light that be available the light they find
and travel of the sort i be do travel on a theme depend on accident the book read on a to travel in the way i be do he write be like painting in acrylic or fresco thing set quickly
the whole shape of a section of the narrative can be determine by some chance meeting some phrase hear or devise
if i have meet someone else my thought might have work differently though i might at the end have arrive at the same general feeling about the place i be in
these comparison will not survive close inspection
there be a sense in which all writing be by available light and all written word be acrylic rather than compliant oil
the process of writing edit and publish a travel book however be surely much more deliberate than these analogy imply and naipaul s editing hand be visible everywhere in this book to the trained eye
as a example there be a kind of second brief prologue to his sustained plunge into the south when he describe a visit to harlem
both event in more in this visit one see the mixture of what be weak and what be strong in his travel writing as well as what be accidental and what be probably purposeful what be unconscious and what may very well be quite conscious as the travel writer apply the putatively inconsiderate acrylic of his word to the page
he visit someone he call only al murray who be describe merely as a writer
this writer old than i have think about seventy from hear his voice on the telephone live in a apartment full of book a serious collection and record
he be enthusiastic about jazz about writing about life
indeed he be a man of enthusiasm easy to be with easy to listen to
his life seem to have be a series of happy discovery
al murray be proud of have attend tuskegee institute found against the odds in the nineteenth century by booker t washington
naipaul a achievement by now a place of tragedy and illusion
it exist he write in a melancholy time warp
it make one think of the prison of the spirit man create for themselves and for others so overpowering so much part of the way thing appear to have to be and then abruptly with a little shift so insubstantial
al murray be proud of his apartment which be at the very end of a central windowless corridor that become uncomfortably warm from fluorescent light as one move through it
al murray like the building and like the idea that a waiter at his club downtown the venerable century club a fact naipaul do not mention be a neighbor here he also like the apartment for its own sake
and al murray love harlem the street of which have demoralize naipaul who see harlem as a whole section of a great city like the war ruin preserve in part of east berlin as a memorial and certain ravaged street of harlem do make one think of war
al murray also have apparently no family a old man in a apartment with his book and record and his enthusiasm
""
this be indeed a restrained polite representation of harlem
but the failure even once to grant al murray the name that appear on the title page of his book the failure to mention his novel train whistle guitar or his collection of essay the omniamericans allow naipaul to depict albert murray surely one of the more gifted contemporary thinker about american culture as a mere curiosity odd frantic irrational and unproductive a writer who probably do nt really write and certainly do not publish seriously
albert murray may indeed fit some of these description i do nt know the man but to read a turn in the south from start to finish be the initial stage of the book as a key to naipaul s dismissal not simply of the intellectual life but also the artistic and the spiritual life of africanamerican
later naipaul will also disparage william du boi and his classic the soul of black folk
it deal he write in tear and rage it offer no program
by contrast the white writer he invoke liberal or racist be say to be creative anne river siddons eudora welty shelby foote d e huge smith h xxr sass james applewhite and much more often than not we be give the name of their book and even now and then quotation from them
indeed the book end with four line of verse by applewhite
white man of the cloth notably will campbell reflect on the complexity of theology and social change
white songwriter be compare to proust as be bob mcdill of nashville whose countryandwestern lyrics be quote at length revelation to him of what be call red neck culture i feel that i have be take through country music to a understanding of a whole distinctive culture something i have never imagine existing in the united state
""
there be to be sure black believer in god and even black who show up on time for their appointment with naipaul
however to read a turn in the south be to be leave with the distinct impression that there be no black poet or novelist in the south that there be no cultural counterpart among black to the red neck culture that so excite and inspire him that jazz and the blue the foundation ironically of the british revolution in popular music of the last thirty year also either do not exist or be so insignificant compare to white country music a ludicrous proposition possible only to a man as ignorant of mass culture as naipaul proudly be that they need not be mention its scope that no black can be really interesting on the weighty question of religious belief and social change
black be contaminate it would seem by their sense of injustice
about the atlanta politician marvin arrington i feel soon that there be nothing new for me to ask that all the point i might raise would founder on the subject of black disadvantage
""
perhaps a line on the second page of the book give us a clue to naipaul s attitude toward black we see the seedling be mechanically plant one black man on the tractor two man on the trolley behind
in one place at least he be frank it be my wish in mississippi to consider thing from the white point of view as far as that be possible for me
why he should want to do so why he should want to ignore the black point of view be not altogether clear
surely it have something to do with mississippi up the congo one do not interview the native
it be as if the black of mississippi really give naipaul no choice
jackson where black be concerned be depict as a place of irrationality and violence or of religious ecstasy that could only be witness almost as a anthropologist might
the music and the singing hold us the dancing hold us we could marvel at the religious dedication he write of a religious crusade
but we could only be witness we could nt participate
in a racially mix society he tell us here after reflect on a aspect of trinidad life in his youth
distinction and difference can have the force of taboo
""
""
""
participation be different from witness they engage different side of the person
and so it be with oldrelief that i put a end to my pleasure in the singing and dancing
""
""
and return to the silent healing of the airconditioned room of the ramada renaissance in of black irrationality impotence and shabbiness be a creature who materialize in jackson after a nasty young black politician play a big or little joke on naipaul naipaul himself can nt decide which carefully make appointment with him that be never keep and be never intend to be keep
the creature offer himself as a corrective to the hostile politician
he say he be black and he want to introduce me to the real black culture naipaul remember of their first telephone conversation
in the end after waste naipaul s time and behave in bizarre way the man invite naipaul to take off his jacket to relax and let me show you how the black really live
i will take you to certain place
you will get the smell of corruption
i understand then put thing together naipaul conclude that he be nt speak metaphorically
the line of development that have begin with his grandfather be end with him his own little world in
so too it would seem with black american culture in general which be apparently doom to extinction
one remember the assumption among many prominent white social scientist at the turn of the century that black be destine to disappear as a race in america mainly because of disease and immorality
this be a old way to see black in the south
the term southerner mean white as the novelist charles chesnutt lament as long ago as in his novel the marrow of tradition black be of the south but they be not southerner
consider in this respect the courteous anne siddons in this book speak about her fellow white we be a conquered and occupied people the only people in the united state to be like that as if black have not be conquer and occupy in way the white south could never have imagine for itself
this assumption remain dominant even in literary criticism and literary history about the south
what be unusual though hardly perfectly the prevailing attitude of white toward black
naipaul s view of one southern city epitomize his general view of the two main race of the south
the city be memphis where naipaul be aware of the sourness of thing there with the black city a extensive irretrievable desolation and with the white people under siege live far to the east
the image be precise black culture as hopeless desolation white culture as embattled endanger under siege
besiege by what by that factor or force so prominent in naipaul s third world writing the bush the primitive beginning to which the third world be destine to return and be return as western civilization withdraw
in one respect naipaul may have take a revisionist step
in the tradition of the cultivated englishman he have choose to see the entire new world as a sort of mishap but scarcely because of slavery or the havoc wreak on native culture
rather he write in the spirit of the buffon reynal joseph mandrillon and condorcet among others
america in this view have have a deleterious effect on the unity and deep meaning of european culture
one be also remind in this special context this fear of the bush in the south of the enormous claim embed in the fugitive intellectual tradition and enunciate in i will take my stand and a gathering of fugitive that white southerner be in fact the last european
they be connect to the perfection of europe in the middle age by the fact of history and by the harmony and beauty of the agrarian tradition which have be no more harmonious and beautiful than in the plantation system with its hierarchy that find slave at the bottom the aristoi at the top and sweet religion everywhere
as allen tate put it in i will take my stand
the south could be ignorant of europe because it be europe that is to say the south have take root in a native soil
use for the intellectual agility require to define its position
its position be selfsufficient and selfevident it be european where the new england position be selfconscious and colonial
so we begin to sense more surely why naipaul have come to the south
he be indeed on a mission a sort of pilgrimage to sacred ground where blood of which the civil war be a mere token have be spill immemorially for the preservation of a certain feeling about history religion and identity that naipaul consider and who would argue with him to be the essence of civilization
allen tate again on religion the south and the civil war the south would not have be defeat have it possess a sufficient faith in its own kind of god the setback of the war be of itself a very trivial one
for naipaul the civil war and slavery itself there be many allusion to both in this book be only painful episode in the constant struggle preserve itself
when you think of the way the race issue have develop naipaul ask jack leland a south carolina aristocrat do you feel sometimes that slavery be a calamity for the south to which leland with his seaman s chest from barbados precious in the family since the penates of history have the grace to reply slavery be a calamity
most important for naipaul in view southern history be not the fact of white enslavement of black or white rebellion in the name of that cause but the enduring desire of southern white to live with reverence for their past to which reverence their feeling about politics art and even religion be relate but distinctly subservient
what appear to be the truth or the accuracy of history in the final analysis be far less important than that the history be cherish
man need history naipaul write in the enigma of arrival after listen to a east indian man mangle the known fact it help them to have a idea of who they be
but history like sanctity can reside in the heart it be enough that there be something there
""
now this approach to history be a piece of irrationality and at the heart of a turn in the south be the conviction that we whoever this we be must effect a truce with irrationality in order to live
the truce with irrationality be in fact the title of two large section of the book and could easily have serve as its title
certain early word of james baldwin about the necessity for him as a negro to effect some kind of truce with this reality have stay with naipaul for the thirty year since he first read them
naipaul s main discovery in the south seem to have be about the coiled relationship between reality and the irrational
the south be offer here as a dynamic site for the investigation of of the possibility of civilization s truce with the full irrationality of the world
one may be disappoint by the supposition that this irrationality be found in large part on the unhappy interpenetration of white and nonwhite culture but at the very least a turn in the south offer a illumination of history and society while reveal naipaul s expanded sense of and respect for the irrational
what he have see above all with the south as his laboratory be the extent to which its people need the irrationality of history and the irrationality of religion and of art and politics to sustain them especially when so much of their life be be threaten by powerful possibly irresistible force
though the unavoidable conclusion be that naipaul concern himself here almost exclusively with white people his book nevertheless throw light on black and white alike and on the human condition just as faulkner s absalom absalorn severely limit as it be in its concern for black manage to illuminate black as well as and the lust for power in america and in the world generally
i would hesitate to declare that naipaul have finally acquire toward the end of his life a new understanding and respect for pragmatism here in america where it serve as a sort of official philosophy
and yet i be remind apropos of the south and the fugitive tradition of a similar pragmatist turn by one of the leader of the fugitive group robert penn warren
more than a decade after i will take my stand the regenerate warren meditate on southern culture its history religion politics and identity in preparation for his novel all the kings man and later admit that behind that revisionist narrative stand not only dante machiavelli and huey long but also the scholarly and benign figure of william james
the philosopher of the pragmatic method the reconciler of religion and science in works such as the will to believe and varzeties of religious experience as well as pragmatism have absolutism of the fugitive by suggest the fundamental term of our modern truce with irrationality
although naipaul devote several interview and several page to the truce with the irrational in the context of politics it be clear that he have little interest in that subject and even less in politician
politics in america now look like a game of number with black poise to take over but meanwhile bring mainly their rage and incompetence to the process
up to a point naipaul understand this response
black have live through too much the irrationality of slavery and the year after slavery have make many irrational and selfdestructive
the collapse of black institution be the final cruelty of slavery that now at what should have be a time of possibility a significant portion of black people should find themselves without the support of faith and community evolve during the last hundred year or more
endangered the white endure
naipaul be interest more in religion than in politics
he concede that religion religion caress comfort stabilize
in the south one can see identity as religion religion as identity
for many white especially in place like charleston with a particularly study sense of history one find a curious kinship the idea of the past as religion
on the whole the ethical sense be high even unsurpassed in no other part of the world have i find people so drive by the idea of good behavior and the good religious life
and that be true for black and white
""
nevertheless in this book art play a part even more important than religion
the work be carefully structure so that the figure of a poet james applewhite of north carolina become the apotheosis of the southern willtocivilization
applewhite dominate the end of the book in precise counterpoint to the antic figure of black al murray of harlem in the beginning
art hallows create make one see naipaul declare
the importance of art for the book s own dramatic purpose there be a certain panache in end with a poet and quote his line in conclusion
but how much do naipaul value southern art he be respectful of the fine writer he meet eudora welty without even hint that he have ever read her work
something be seriously awry however when the rival today to the virgin mary who inspire the grand cathedral of europe be elvis presley
not even the fugitive think that the art of the south such as it be rival mont st michel and chartres and the other triumph of medieval european culture
face a poster that show elvis and a staircase lead to his mother and to his mansion graceland naipaul read it thus religious art of a kind with christian borrowing the beatification of the central figure with all his sexuality graceland like a version of new jerusalem in a medieval doomsday painting
""
i would guess that naipaul give his interest in the art of the region than because of the selfinvestigation that he conduct in this place that remind him so much of his caribbean origin even as he work hard to conceal that selfinvestigation
the major question here be not about the art that the south have produce and be produce as in welty or applewhite s work it be about the possibility of art under the term of a truce with irrationality and especially when that irrationality terrify the artist into homelessness and silence or journalism
in write about applewhite naipaul be write about himself
one of his major discovery in this tour be the close historical connection in early century between the trifling island of his birth and some powerful center of american culture notably charleston and philadelphia
astonished naipaul think he hear the distinctive accent of the speech of barbados among black around charleston strange tiny barbados find a echo in grand south carolina but then he reflect that the little island have be the franklin s autobiography to which north american sometimes run away to try their fortune not as to the frontier but as to a city
he discover too that the same little island be the model for the south carolina plantation colony
the island still cut a bright figure in the memory of the aristocrat of the south who keep hark back to the colonial british west indies as to a mark of blood and ancestry
toughminded as ever naipaul squash any idea that something be to be make of this caribbean of the golden past
perhaps he offer there can not truly be say to be a aristocracy in a place that come to nothing they be just people like robinson crusoe who go to the wrong place
whereas charleston be claim by the large event of a continental history and its smalltime beginning be now indescribably romantic
""
what the island once mean be not completely unknown to naipaul whose early the the region s history but here vividly contextualize by the extant glory of charleston it take on a new significance
apart from his first travel book the middle passage which be about the west indies naipaul have never be closer to home in his travel writing
i mean home in the literal sense and also in the sense of his own ending
with the death of his young sister in trinidad and the premature death in london of his young brother shiva naipaul also a novelist travel writer and harsh critic of the third world and with his own accumulation of year a change have come over him
he write movingly in the enigma of arrival of the occasion of the funeral of his sister it force us to look on death
it force me to face the death i have be contemplate at night in my sleep it fit a real grief where melancholy have create a vacancy as if to prepare me for the moment
it show man the grief and the glory
naipaul have become more concerned than ever with his trinidad family and its past and with the memory of his father to whom a turn in the south be dedicate in ever renewed homage
""
both sense of the term home i think be implicate in the fact that his many reference to trinidad prompt him to make connection not simply between the island and the south but between his personal past and the southern landscape that compel his recollection
about home his personal past two insight appear near the end of the book to dominate naipaul s thinking
for him what lend a peculiar force to these two startling insight or idea be that they be quietly express by the poet applewhite whom he meet in durham
of the first insight he say he applewhite could nt have know how directly he be speak to me
of the second it be extraordinary
not only as have happen more than express thing i have feel as a child and a adolescent in trinidad
he be alsothough he be from the other side of the track talk like howard the black assistant whose home naipaul visit at the start of the book
the first insight share with naipaul be that there be no landscape like the first that one know
the second share with naipaul and howard be a feeling parallel to the feeling of be at home in a particular place where one be born and have live of be also a strange there
applewhite have speak of the sensation of be so utterly at home in and a part of a place that one feel somehow coextensive with the place
but on the other hand there be a sense of separateness in be in part of myself a observe strange in my own native land
to the extent that at time i be fascinate by the idea of the preexistence of howard have say
i feel different at the high school
it be what you think and what you feel that make you different
i always feel different
which lead me to believe i be born in the wrong town
like many people
""
naipaul know at once that these two sentiment reflect primary intuition of his own
but his response to the tension between a feeling of home and a feeling of estrangement from that home be quite different from that of applewhite or howard
they love and feel attach to their home in spite of often feel alien to it or even have move away
applewhite go one step far and make poetry out of both his love of home and his distance from it
grow up his sense of difference have be strong my feeling of duality at that time be be physically in the world i identify with but which on the other hand completely leave out a whole other side of my psyche or my soul
he like it how it could be pigheaded and can cherish ignorance
it can cherish the unreasonable the unreasoning
nevertheless there have be his mysterious desire to know to have the right to be aware or to name in language in harmonious language or in music to name thing or else simply to name
art he conclude be a sort of divine uselessness
""
art too be irrational
applewhite have meet one kind of irrationality with another that be superior or divine
out of loyalty to his original landscape and his capacity to distance himself without surrender to alienation he have evolve a art of the place north carolina his family s land tobacco field pig stick tobacco cure as in his ode to a chinaberry tree with its poem about the farmland its crop its animal its people
these poem naipaul discover on the spot as it were may be a reflection of art s divine uselessness in applewhite s own phrase but like robert frost s poetry it be about human being do make work with their hand
such reconciliation be impossible for naipaul whose triumph be that he have make a art not of his place but of his displacement
for him a art of the west indian place have become impossible
for one thing his original landscape unlike applewhite be be go
what remain be only the scarcely bearable idea of the beginning of thing now exist only in my heart no long existing physically in the ravaged repopulate trinidad of today
""
to me this be one of the most memorable line in naipaul
the idea that his trinidad origin may be lodge in his heart be a revelation we have long think trinidad expunge from that place altogether
in its own way the thought be as new and startle as the image of himself that naipaul present at heroic black woman minister tell him of her day of civil right protest in the s
long before the coming of martin luther king jr
and his righteous army she and others including white quaker have try to integrate lunch counter in washington dc and have be spit upon and humiliate
the story prove too much for her interviewer
naipaul weep
the scarcely bearable idea of the beginning of thing on the one hand and on the other his sister s death fit a real grief where melancholy have create a vacancy these be virtual admission on naipaul s part of what he have be too proud east indianproud one might say in a trinidadian context to admit before how much he have love that first landscape trinidad out of which have come his early and most memorable short story and novel
they be admission too it seem to me of how much at this point in a reconciliation with that original landscape a token of which be his gracious acceptance of the trinity cross but also a admission of how deeply almost unforgivably trinidad have wound him as a child and youth
how do trinidad wound him not simply i think in the sense of the hurt that any society can inflict on a sensitive young artist
the hurt be rather more specific in the everpresent campaign of humiliation and demoralization and threat of violence aim at indian that he would have encounter as a youth in the capital port of spain in the late s
he live there after leave his home in the country to attend high school at queen s royal college from which he depart after win a state scholarship to england in 
i do not want to leave the impression that east indian be not for their part hostile to afrotrinidadians
however they be a minority and their normal hostility take a different far less physical form where few indian live
this aspect of naipaul s life have receive virtually no treatment by critic except for selwyn cudjoe in his xxv s naipaul a materialist reading
instead in part out of ignorance the emphasis in discuss naipaul and race have be overwhelmingly on his selfhatred and his hatred of fellow nonwhite
however it be no more possible to understand naipaul s mind and art without reference to racism violence and intolerance in trinidad than to understand richard wright without reference to the same factor in the south
the resemblance of naipaul to wright have never be note as far as i know and may cause naipaul some discomfort but it may well be that wright and not conrad trollope or greene wright with his black skin and humble mississippi origin come close to be naipaul s literary and cultural antecedent
like naipaul wright be a exile from a home country south of black and white which he not only hate but firmly in his autobiography black boy he denounce his fellow black southerner as no other black writer and few white have ever do how timid our joy how bare our tradition how hollow our memory how lacking we be in those intangible sentiment that bind man to man and how shallow be even our despair
renounce the south which he see as make up of two primitive culture black and white he head north and then to europe to be reborn as a believer in civilization which he identify aggressively with the west
wright too have early success in write fiction then clearly succumb to the sense that the novel no long to paraphrase naipaul carry conviction
he continue to try to force out book such as his roman a these the outsider or the very poor psychological novel savage holiday which contain no black character at all
but like naipaul he turn to travel writing in order to express himself black power pagan spain about the hopelessly primitive nature of that country and the color curtain about the bandung conference of and the third world it more or less announce and about which wright be quite suspicious
block in fiction wright vent his despairing allegiance to creative art in hundred of haiku pen in his later year and leave behind unpublished
what these two man have in common be not at root shame about blackness in one case or about be east indian in the other
it be rather a genuine sense of have be wound by their own and a genuine sense of homelessness link to a despairing love of home
and while art commonly flourish out of the tension between a sense of belong and a sense of alienation it grow only fitfully out of such radical alienation and demoralization as they feel such despair and melancholy
for writer affect thus a secondary art be possible travel writing critical essay or a art of nihilism
almost impossible be works the original beloved landscape of one s desire or the dynamics of love and belong
what i believe naipaul have discover late in his life in his personal encounter with the conflict between death as true grief on the one hand and chronic melancholy or depression on the other be something about the dignity of the irrational and the necessity of make not peace with it which be impossible but a truce
out of this truce art and what pass for peace in human affair may perhaps come
he have come close to home even as he await passage to his final home
by arnold rampersad
i have be ask by a editor for a account of my experience of be interview by xxv s naipaul but the fragmentary piece have founder upon the single discrepancy between my memory of what we have say and do and the version represent in a turn in the south
there mr naipaul have describe as from inside it a graveyard in the field across from the farmhouse of the applewhite family a fenced plot hold the marker stone of paternal ancestor including a civil war veteran and his father
yet we have not actually enter that space with its boundary of rust iron and its weathering inscription
the accuracy of his portrayal be found upon his visit to many other similar spot and on my version of this one in particular
it be while hear a lecture by arnold rampersad on mr naipaul s personal stake in this book that i begin to conceive explanation which make this event more interesting and possibly intelligible
mr naipaul and i have meet i have drive him him a tobacco field and he have have tea with my wife and son and me at our home on seven mile creek
i have be painstakingly question in two session at the carolina inn in chapel hill the base of mr naipaul s operation in the area
but then he have propose that i drive him to my home in stantonsburg in eastern north carolina and what be know as the fluecured tobacco district to see the family farm which be still operate by my father
with some misgiving i agree
perhaps i fear that the farming culture and tobaccorituals as i have recount them would not sufficiently agree with presentday reality
but the chance to spend more time with this man of such tremendous comprehension and humanity be irresistible
and as it turn out the trip go very well
mr naipaul be not disappointed in the civil war era applewhite farmhouse nor in dee crime who live there currently and farm for my father
mr naipaul feel that the landscape of the than diminish by the original he see around him
and though no tobacco be be put in on our farm that day a family friend dan whitley be operate his mechanical harvester a few hundred yard up the road
the visit go exactly as present in mr naipaul s narrative in a turn in the south until almost the end
it be that slight disjunction between what i remember happening and what he write that i be here attempt to explain to myself
to do that i must recount some of the early conversation between us
the question of mr naipaul be that have come back to me during arnold rampersad s lecture be deceptively simple
he have ask whether i have ever feel lose in that early eastern carolina world of my boyhood
i have tell him of the size of my town its population of about a thousand and of these people s fierce preoccupation with the pragmatics of planting cropping grade and sell
and we suggest a incipient cultural selfawareness in the folkways i remember
he seize with emphatic interest upon my account of the typical farmwife be sweeping of the bare yard of the farmhouse under the shade oak with dogwood sapling bind into a broom leave orderly scratch in the sandy clay
that have be in the day before power mower and the lawn they make feasible
he remember see similar line inscribe by sweep in the yard of african village and associate these with japanese garden and their raked gravel
he be pleased with my description of the wrapping of cured and graded tobacco into bunch call hand and their regular placement in squared pile on the auctionhouse floor
he seem to be move by my assertion that tobacco grow in its best handcraft aspect as i remember it have be a kind of folk art
i feel that we be both hungry for sign of some reach after expressiveness and meaningful order in this landscape gloat over by humidity and heat and by the pressure of of my sense of the pathos surround the ritual of food and drink as i remember them
i say it seem that the food have always to be overdo the iced tea too sweet to make up for some inadequacy some impoverishment
ah yes he say in the poor area of india thing be also too sweet
it be to reassure themselves that they have enough that the people do this he say
i feel that he know and feel more of deprivation than he be reveal
this be when he ask if i have ever feel lose in the south
i tell him that i have feel lose
i recall for him the strange blazing outerworld which for many month after i have be say to have rheumatic fever shut me up with book by zane gray and jack london and edgar rice burroughs
i tell him of my melancholy sense that the world in these book have seem so much more authentic at time than the world i walk wise could explain to myself
i say that tarzan of the ape have come to seem especially representative
apparently i have conflate the novel and the early movie so that for me tarzan be insert into the jungle and give over to the great ape and their gesturelanguage and life of heroic physicality by a plane crash rather than by a shipwreck
at any rate i describe how at time i have feel my psyche as if suddenly introduce into a tropical factcentric world like young tarzan s separate from the cultural base of his ancestor origin
as the more recent movie greystoke so vividly dramatize the young lord be heir to a not unimpressive english patrimony
i have no doubt take surrogate satisfaction in both tarzan s ability to adapt completely to life in the jungle and in his actually have a english parentage
i feel that i often fail to master the expected physical skill and hardihoods of that farming community and that the other realm the hint progenitorculture and its implied high level a series of hint and guess
halfjokingly i tell him that when i have discover plato and plotinus tarzan s plane crash have come to seem a lot like the traumatic descent of the soul into matter
i have feel crashlanded from some deja vu prior existence among kindly but inarticulate ape
i have come trailing cloud of nostalgia for name explanation and understanding everything from sex to the constellation to the correct name of tree
i have feel that nothing have be explain that i have be hug to the body of people call family with only a terribly poignant love and need for them sharpen by the impossibility of any adequate speaking between us
my heromodels in the novel even be man of few word man who ride the prairie or trek the north with wolf or swing through treetop who let their action speak for them
and i have not be very good at action and have desperately want to learn to speak
as i sigh
the idea of grow up in some vacancy of knowledge seem intimately familiar to him
i feel that he have be hurt by a analogous location in brute fact and ignorance and then hurt again by the loss of that place
i know from my own experience though i could not then say it that the nostalgia with which we be bind to a first soil may be proportional to the pain it have give us by its strangeness and recalcitrance
the paradox for me be that this place which have seem at first so utterly oppose to my emotional hunger and instinct for knowledge have come to be the language of my poetry
the hard sting have go in and have be change by time into the thing i praise and elegized
mr naipaul be apparently fascinate by the particularity the localism the rootedness of my background and experience as i be by the multinational scope and extensiveness of his
i envy him the many analogy and the context of knowledge through which he he envy me my continued location in so historically definite and inescapable a site
he say i have a audience that be my own
i remind him that much of the civilized world form his readership
he seem to take a very melancholy view of that broad slice of the world i evoke
too abstract too problematic too little particularize in place to be depend on i understand him to say
he have be in a strange fashion deprive of a single homeland by the event of his parentage and life
perhaps that be why in his quintessential tact and gentleness despite his fierce intelligence and need to know all particulars all concrete exempla he hold back with me there short of the family graveyard
for me consciously the wish not to go on be not deeply feel
perhaps i be tired perhaps i fear it would disappoint
i think at the time that xxv s naipaul hold back out of a kind of reverence for a reverence he fear that the simple stone and the name of my great great grandfather and great grandfather and of their brother and wife would not live up to the description i have give him drive down
perhaps in the declining light the letter would not be legible
now however i believe we may have hold back by intuitive conspiracy to defer the overwhelmingly personal relation between myself and those grave so that for a while long that concrete rectangle of history could belong also to him
and so that he in his articulate consciousness could belong to me and not be replace by name and date which have never be consciously meaningful to me
i know that intellectually this particular graveplot be important to mr naipaul only representatively generically
he have see many like it in his southern travel
it be only one more small embodiment of this history we live in the midst of and could not see for its proximity
i know that in a way i too be only representative as a son naipaul be fascinate that i have come of this inarticulate haltingly selfconscious region with its mute narrative of breastwork in battlefield and family grave but have attempt a language
that be what he be do on a much broad scale and we stand there together for a moment look at the briargrown fence and the candlegleaming limestone shaft
my own uneasiness with these progenitorstelae be that they be both too familiar and unknowable like the shape of the dna in my cell
the story of my great grandfather be have be shoot through the lung at chancellorsville have always have a faroff fictive unrelated quality for me
the iron csa marker at the foot of his grave be only a curiosity
i suspect that mr naipaul see me as the product of a history which the history of my own consciousness could only very partially incorporate
if i be at all to be read and to read myself it would have to be by the light reflect from a large pattern
we have a set of cultural origin represent in part by the english hymn and king james scripture of the methodist church i have be raise in by the english china of my paternal grandmother s ritual dinner and by the english text of my maternal grandmother s essay for shutin she herself cripple by arthritis her poignant sentimental quotation from tennyson and gray
i think we share a feeling of hurtful early separation from a cultural centrality and savor in parallel irony the acrid substitution of tobacco of the smokeborne essentiality of roast pig blue in a cloud across a broomsedged field like the literal s elegy for the absence of a language

by james applewhite
in a variety of book from philosophy and the mirror of nature to contingency irony and solidarity and a spate of influential article richard rorty have mount a farreaching critique of what might be call our contemporary intellectual pseudodoxia
that term francis bacon s be employ to refer to various notion in the human mind that stand in the way of the advancement of human knowledge
these notion or idol be he say of four kind and they need to be overcome in the furtherance of knowledge idol of the tribe be inherent in human nature seduce us into believe that sensory perception can give us direct knowledge of reality rather than knowledge relative to the standpoint and coloration of the sense and refract through the mind s own desire for coherence and regularity idol of the den reflect the particular and singular disposition of individual perceiver and the fact that their interpretation be dependent upon what be reflect in the cave of their to the symbolic form of human commerce and exchange and their susceptibility to debasement whenever their inherent plurisignificance in philip wheelright s coinage be discount or word be take for thing language confuse with actual entity and idol of the theater which bacon associate with the purely inventive dogma of various philosophical system that sow the seed of error in human mind operate not as lens through which to see the universe as it actually be but as stage play design to produce particular effect on a audience
for our purpose it matter scarcely at all that bacon prescribe as the antidote to these toxin what many intellectual would now describe as but another poison
by insist that human being could regain mastery over the natural world only through the application of the scientific method for gather data classify material conduct experiment interpret result and generalize inductively bacon be merely displace one of the idol of the theater with what rorty would describe as another whose blandishment no long need
what be more remarkable be that despite the foundationalist pretension of bacon s great instauration his diagnosis of modern idolatry carry within itself the clue to what many modern intellectual rorty among them would now accept as effective vaccine for these disorder
to counter the influence of the idol of the tribe bacon recommend a epistemological skepticism toward all that be seemingly mirror by our faculty of perception
to resist the temptation of the idol of the den he counsel suspicion of whatever the mind seize and dwell upon with peculiar satisfaction
as a prosthetic for the idol of the marketplace he urge a new respect for the difference between language and its referent and a new appreciation of the equivocality of word
and finally as a preventive against the idol of the theater he advise the cultivation of a studied disbelief hold that the nostrum of philosophy and particularly that kind of philosophy which confuse itself with the mixture of matter divine and human as heretical religion
""
bacon s prescience in these matter be by no means a sign of rorty s belatedness
it be rather a way of underscore the scope and more importantly the essential significance of rorty s philosophical project
rorty be deeply oppose to put science or reason in the place where religious faith or belief once be and he view all attempt to defend theory in what stanley fish call the strong sense by develop a general model of hermeneutics that would be free of contingency contextual circumstance and interested judgment as beside the point
and yet he be as committed as bacon ever be to challenge the way we currently think about thought or rather the way we think about the relation between thought and experience
he want to delineate what deserve to be call a new model of the constituent of this process and a different not to say more useful way of relate morally and socially
so conceive rorty s project be part of the ongoing revision of american philosophical and cultural pragmatism
as we can now appreciate the project amount to the most important critical and political attempt since john dewey to resituate the tradition of american pragmatism within the broad framework of modern western liberalism
it deserve to be describe as at least a modest instauration to replace bacon s great one because rorty s project assume that this resituating will require a fundamental alteration of the goal of liberal society itself and the creation of a new set of intellectual technique for pursue the mastery it afford
the word resituate be no accident here
in much recent literary criticism no small amount of it influence by the position rorty take so powerfully in consequence of pragmatism pragmatism or neopragmatism as it be sometimes call have come to be associate with cultural current that be think to be postliberal if not antiliberal in some very specific way
it align itself as a kind of writing and nineteenthcentury idealism and twentiethcentury textualism with the postmodernist and poststructuralist repudiation of culture as a expression of individual consciousness weave into pattern of consensus and dissent of conformity and conflict and it prefer to view culture as a intertextual system of sign that can be infinitely redescribe
it have thus position the critical recovery of pragmatist discourse essentially beyond the kind of dispute that use to vex liberal criticism theoretically
the old dispute concerning the relation between the universal and the particular the absolute and the relative the political and the personal the necessary and the contingent the selfcreative and the socially reconstructive the ethical and the artistic be deem by the neopragmatist either false or irrelevant
whichever the case there immediately follow a rejection of the first term in each pair in favor of a embrace of the second and a subsequent assertion that pragmatic thinking be antifoundationalist antiessentialist antiintentionalist and antirepresentational
it be a pragmatism commit ultimately and exclusively to the effectual contingency of value as the local figuringworking out as well as we heterogeneously can of what seem to work better rather than bad
it may therefore be describe in smith s version as the most ideologically unillusioned and politically unmotivated of critical theory or as in the version propose by walter benn michaels and steven knapp in their celebrated essay against theory as no theory at all
rather it be a name for that kind of practice which be critical of all other practice that resort to theory for the sake of try to govern practice from a position mistakenly assume to exist outside of it
rorty s relation to this postmodernist pragmatist revisioning have become increasingly complex
while support and as we shall see in certain way further the ironizing of discourse to which this have lead he have at the same time distance himself from the wholesale critique of democratic individualism or what c b mcpherson call possessive individualism that go along with foucault in nietzsche or heidegger
side with those who accentuate the historicity and relativism of all cultural practice rorty nonetheless insist that some practice like art and ethnography and one would suppose certain kind of investigative journalism be much more humanlybeneficial than others such as theology or let us say advertising
even as he dismiss all talk of history as a evolutionary process he still believe that intellectual and moral progress can be measure by the history of increasingly useful metaphor
insist that conscience as freud teach us be a product of no more than the accident of upbringing he yet write a prose that be recurrently hortatory and determinedly edify
these paradox would be more disconcerting if they be nt manage with such disarming candor and panache
rorty remind me a bit of kenneth burke s injunction to use all there be to use but here there be nothing eclectic about the all
by put his all to selective as well as effective as wallace stevens once note in a helpful distinction be intent on make sure of every foot of the way than like the poet whose attention be always divert because the sense of the certainty of the presence about him be as nothing to the presence themselves
rorty s version of pragmatism be clearly less interested than some of the other new variant in repudiate its tie with the history of western liberalism
he want to recuperate albeit cautiously what may have be gloss in this process of postmodernist revisioning
this have recently entail a change or at least a sharpening of focus in his own thinking about the pragmatic legacy itself at any rate it have lead to a important extension and development of some of his early idea particularly as they bear upon his interest in the culture of democracy
in its rortian postmodernist form pragmatism be premise on the contingency as rorty describe them successively in the first three chapter of his new book of language be large with complexity but rorty be masterful at thread his way through them
pair each term with a major thinker who serve less as a guide rorty have assume this virgilian role for himself than as a kind of benchmark davidson with language freud with self and a combination of isaiah berlin joseph schumpeter michael oakeshott john rawls and in the immediate background john dewey with community rorty proceed to delineate the main element of his proposal for the reconstitution of intellectual method
the contingency of language commit rorty to the idea that truth be no long out there in a reality beyond language but in here so to speak in the relation among our sentence
truth be something we make with metaphor it be not already there wait to be find with word
just as nothing possess a intrinsic nature neither word self nor the world rorty think of this as the residue of the notion that reality be the us no closer to the way thing truly be
it only move us into a more useful figurative or tropological relation with them
in this conception language be a medium neither exactly of representation nor of expression
it be rather a instrument of redescription
davidson let us think of the history of language and thus of culture as darwin teach us to think of the history of a coral reef
old metaphor be constantly die off into literalness and then serve as a platform and foil for new metaphor
to accept this analogy be for rorty to believe that a recognition of the contingency of language be tie inextricably to the dedivinization of the self and the world
this be the point make by intellectual historian like han blumenberg who narrativize these connection by argue that they be the product of a sequence of transformation
where once upon a time we feel a need to worship something which lay beyond the visible world as rorty summarize the story blumenberg tell in the legitimacy of to worship something that lay within the world and thus decide to substitute the love of truth for the love of god
by the end of the eighteenth century however the love of truth be compel to give way to the love of self as human being transfer their worship from the quasi divinity of the world describe by science to the quasi divinity of their own spiritual nature
but by the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth the idealistic or romantic worship of the self be to be displace by the realization variously phrase by nietzsche freud and wittgenstein that we do nt in fact need to worship anything as divine once we recognize that everything our language our conscience our community be a product of time and chance
""
this be a narrative that lend considerable credence to the assumption that the self be linguistically construct and that reality be largely unaffected by the language we attach to it
it also support the with alteration in language than with revolution in belief
as kuhn argue in the copernican revolution we do not decide on the basis of some telescopic observation or on the basis of anything else that the earth be not the center of the universe that macroscopic behavior could be explain on the basis of microstructural motion and that prediction and control should be the principle aim of scientific theorizing
rather after a hundred year of inconclusive muddle the european find themselves speak in a way which take these interlocked thesis for grant
language in this view be more like a set of tool for perform a task than a medium for get something straight
but as rorty point out the creator of new language the inventor of new vocabulary unlike the master of various craft may not know what it be that they want to do before they have create a language with which to do it
thus the problem of adequation still remain but it be now solve or long how to secure agreement between one s language and something that stand beyond it such as fact truth or reality the world offer no criteria for compare alternative metaphor but how to get over one way of talk and acquire the habit of another
this be pragmatism with a vengeance and rorty be nothing if not consistent in practice it
since the key to changing mind be not better argument but alternative vocabulary his chief discursive tactic be to make the position he oppose look bad by show how limited and brittle they be and to cast his own position in the most favorable light by reveal how many different issue it can illumine
either way the oftnoted frustration of rorty s prose frustration it should be remark that have nothing to do with the lucidity of his sentence the deftness of his move or the elegance of his example begin to make sense
his occasional simplification of opposing argument his constant tacking in the face of stretch his agile but also disconcerting transition from one analogy to another his incisive almost aphoristic synopsis of supporting position his constant and always slightly altered redescription of central point all find their justification in a emersonian conviction that deference to the language of one s ancestor or at least to the inherited description of their contingency amount to a kind of mortuary practice what rorty describe in another arresting figure as worship of the corpse of their metaphor
""
this emersonian iconoclasm thinking of rorty no less than of emerson it could as easily be describe as a antinomian intransigence be nowhere more vividly exemplify than in the practice of the socalled strong poet
rorty apply this term more broadly than do harold bloom to the originator of any new word the founder of any new language but like bloom and emerson before him he conceive this figure a little hyperbolically as the vanguard of the species
all strong poet be ironist anything can be make to look good or bad by be redescribe and their renunciation of the attempt to formulate criteria of choice between final vocabulary
they be to be distinguish from the rest of us ironist by their ability to recreate what nietzsche call the all it be into a thus i will it
""
the strong poet be thus the kind of self who refuse to be a copy who be horrify at the thought of be in bloom s wording a replica
the question be whether a self terrorize by the thought of live off the capital of other people creativity be more prepared than any other self to accept the fact of its own contingency
indeed by couch the term of his or her selfinvention in language usually reserve for the deity rorty s strong poet seem in danger of the opposite of hypostatizing its own sense of be rather than provisionalizing it
to put this more directly if the portentous capacity to will oneself and direction to something as benign as a emersonian or better a franklinesque experiment in selfcreation can it not lead in another direction toward a zarathustrean exercise in selfdeification
despite the fact that we be all by now alert to the significance of this kind of terminological instability rorty can be occasionally obtuse about the referential equivocality it imply
to rorty such verbal ambiguity be more often than not the sign of a epistemological playfulness that derive from the conviction that the self and the world have be empty of intrinsic significance have become dedivinized so to speak leave the field to those whose aim be to develop not the one right description but a expanding repertoire of alternative description
here the exemplary text be the first part of derridats the post card entitle envois whose whimsical fantasizing strike rorty as the end product of ironist theorizing
but to the careful reader of some of rorty s own equivocation about heidegger and nabokov such verbal escapade rorty call them certain moral insensibility about the way in which play can become simply frivolous and possibly banal redescription evasive reweaving narcissistic
to rorty such reservation as these almost fail to matter
the importance culture hero possess for us derrida be one of his be more often associate with the name of their book and the style of selfperfection those book represent for us than with how well they live up to their own selfimage
but this beg several question
one be whether there be always consensus about what those selfimage actually consist of
in the celebrated case of heidegger and say paul de man there seem to be a good deal of confusion on the part of their defender and detractor alike as to what it be they mean to represent in the first place
another have to do with whether our caring or not caring about the integrity of our culture hero remain the same no matter what they represent
again it would seem that the de man and heidegger affair all party to all side of the current debate about these figure seem to care about nothing other than the relation between the image of self project by their work and the actual life they lead
not that rorty find all strong poet admirable any more than he believe all redescribers be invincible
if the world and the self have be deprive of their divinity this neither mean that the world and the self have lose their power over us nor that the expert in human redescription will always invent selfimage we will want to emulate
rorty be acutely sensitive to the fact that the world can overcome us that other self can betray and destroy us that our own vulnerability to despair grief and rage can engulf us
but in add that the only remedy to such hazard lie as so many strong poet have attest over the century in our ability to acknowledge contingency pain and otherness for what they be he may be slight the other half of their testimony the invention of the self and the abjection of the self
in other word their realism whether comic or tragic have not stop short of acknowledge that the self in its very desire to achieve autonomy and redefinition be often the author of its own embarrassment the creator of its own pain the parent of its own misery
nor be this insight lose on the figure most central to rorty s discussion of the self
freud s theory of human nature acquire its immense modern authority not simply because it verify the fairly recent discovery that human being be product of the contingency of their upbringing what set it apart from all other contemporary theory equally historicist and positivist be that it also confirm the more traditional and tragic view that in their desire to escape or overcome these contingency human being simultaneously become the muse of their own unmaking
this lacuna in rorty s understanding of freud and by extension in his appreciation of the legacy of strong poet do not deter him from might be call secondary redescribers such as literary and cultural critic
comparers rather than explainers or inventor contextualizers more than evaluator or creator the arnold and trilling and sontags and spivaks of this world be expert in place book in relation to other book
hence their range of acquaintance be more important than their deep reading
by constantly enlarge the sphere of the cultural conversation they help us resist the seduction of any one final vocabulary
it be worth observe that rorty extend the notion of literature to include any works that critic discuss any works that might conceivably have moral relevance might conceivably alter one s sense of what be possible and important
literary criticism thus become regrafted on the branch of what be once call moral philosophy
but in critical term moral philosophy then become to a discouraging extent largely academicized
the critic be no long oblige to determine the literary merit or the moral worth of any work but can content him or herself with encouraging ethical reflection advisor and suggest way in which the tension within this canon may be ease or where necessary sharpen
""
if strong poet like hegel nietzsche heidegger derrida and foucault afford us model of selfperfection of individual salvation rorty find their usefulness in social reconstruction very much more limited
while they be of enormous assistance in free the self for redescription and thus in help liberal society exchange the dream of rationalize for that of poetizing itself they be pretty much useless when it come to politics
their central social task be restrict to further the dedivinization of liberal culture by show how the language of moral responsibility and social purpose be always contingent
but they have little to contribute to the actual restructuring of society
for that we must turn to a entirely different line of thinker to author such as marx mill dewey and habermas who have make the public sphere and not the private the subject of their reflection
interestingly enough rorty no need of conceptual redescription
though he take many of his cue from modern social thinker like michael oakeshott and john rawls philosopher who have retain enlightenment liberalism while drop enlightenment rationalism he write that xxj s mill s suggestion that government devote themselves to optimize the balance between leave people s private life alone and prevent suffering seem to me pretty much the last word
the ideal citizen of this new world of revisionary american liberalism will therefore be a ironist who combine a acceptance of the contingency of all political perspective with a belief that whatever be mean by the good and the true in liberal society will always be a function of free discussion
rorty have read too much of the frankfurt school and marxist theory generally to believe that freedom be ever innocent of ideological coloring
all he ask for or think we need be the standard bourgeois kind of freedom that be possible when the press the judiciary the election and the university be free social high education be common and peace and wealth have make possible the leisure necessary to listen to lots of different people and think about what they say
while such freedom may have nothing more to recommend them than the kind of support history show they have furnish for private agenda of selfrecreation rorty think that they can and do generate distinctive public debate about two issue central to the creation and maintenance of a democratic society
the first be how to balance the private need for individual selffulfillment with the public need to leave people alone to use or abuse such personal opportunity as they will
the second be how the desire democracy typically create for wealth freedom and peace can be adjust to the fact that those desire can not be equally accommodate economically socially and politically
rorty s liberal be thus not without conviction
draw on judith shklar s definition of a liberal as a person who think that cruelty be the bad thing we do he add to this a thing we do
as a liberal rorty account these conviction socially and ethically salutary as a ironist he know that this can not be prove
the liberal be therefore place in the paradoxical situation of have to grant as isaiah berlin once quote joseph schumpeter to say the relative validity of his or her own conviction and yet stand for them unflinchingly
schumpeter conceive of this paradox as the difference between barbarism and civilization
berlin himself be more circumspect
while he be prepare to admit the deep metaphysical need for great ontological certainty he be equally convinced that to allow this need to determine one s life be symptomatic of a equally deep and more dangerous moral and political immaturity
""
rorty understand this admonition to mean or at any rate to give him license to say that the aim of liberal society should be to cure us of the dependence on metaphysics by which he also mean metaphysical theory altogether
berlin merely say us
the difference in interpretation be reveal
what rorty characterize as a disease from which we should all be heal berlin regard as a basic human desire which should not be misapply
therefore what the liberalism of berlin be willing to tolerate so long as it can be constrain the liberalism of rorty be intent on expunge as a infection
hence rorty s liberalism be anything but socially passive and it be also anything but consistently ironic
if on the public side it be commit to extend solidarity to those who be presently and injuriously exclude from it on the private side it be resolve that we can only make the best self of ourselves as we can if we turn antimetaphysics into the intellectual architectonic of a new cultural dispensation and construe dedivinization as its new method essentially its new rhetoric of salvation
there be serious difficulty with both these commitment
rorty have a firm grasp of the one but only a tentative grip on the other
on the political excluded can only carry us so far in the direction of social renewal because the language of personal hope and public responsibility be philosophically incommensurable
by this he mean that if solidarity be the best thing we do and rorty be emphatic on this point there be no way of satisfactorily explain its relationship with selfcreation
on the contrary rorty be convinced and in many respect be convincing that more than twenty century worth of attempt to reconcile the language of personal fulfillment and the language of social obligation have end in the sand
the only alternative be to keep these language as separate as possible and to live with the compromise this entail
the compromise situate him he believe almost directly between the foucaults of this world who be too ironic to be liberal and the habermases who be too liberal to be ironic
such a person be willing to live with the tension of believe with the nietzschean foucauldian line that most of our social ill derive from turn private provisional vocabulary the tradition from mill and dewey to habermas that the social goal of reduce pain and humiliation may be more commanding than any necessity for individual redefinition
the reason he can nt bring these two line of reflection into closer conversation be because he be convinced that the radical metaphysical suspicion of the one undercut the inevitable metaphysical pretension of the other
but this be to forget that dewey who be another of rorty s culture hero describe metaphysics as simply another form of redescription and then go on to show if not in experience and nature the text that serve as the basis for rorty s famous repudiation of metaphysics then in art as experience how in a truly poetized or estheticized universe metaphysics furnish the motivating force for redescribe itself
dewey s procedure be to argue that to estheticize or poetize experience be to define it as a process whose realization completion or consummations as dewey term them possess as part of their nature the tendency to generate more experience like a esthetic model of experience guarantee that there can be no last word no final closure no ultimate ending because the process which occur there be always be translate into something more something different
redescription then simply become what life be like when live under the sign of the poem
but dewey do not stop there
for he know that the sign of the poem the agon of esthetics be always social rather than solitary
it be social both because its rhetorical aim be to communicate and because it spring from a shared fund of experience
dewey s estheticism thus confirm his liberalism by show that fraternity can never be dissociate as rorty think it must from liberty and equality
unless we grant that our private life with ourselves be dependent upon our shared life with others we have no way of account for why we should either be concern about others or want to change ourselves
rorty be much too serious a thinker to leave these thing to chance and postmodernist commitment to contingency and irony to eviscerate his notion of community
this finally leave us as we shall see with a liberalism disconcertingly reminiscent of the caricature pose by its recent leftist critic a liberalism whose sense of freedom verge on be another name for selfishness and whose conception of solidarity be to a very large degree base on mutual suffering
rorty be not afraid of criticism from the left since he think that the politics of liberalism like its ethics can only be justify in terms of what wilfrid sellars call weintentions
in the language of weintentions the bourgeois liberal be simply someone whose special sense of we from the late eighteenth century to the present have be predicate at least partially on what nathaniel hawthorne speak of his own art once describe as a series of attempt and very imperfectly successful one to open a intercourse with the world
however rorty do not think of this either as a ancient human disposition with europe and america in the last three hundred year
it be not associate with any power large than that embody in a concrete historical situation for example the power of the rich european and american democracy to disseminate their custom to other part of the world a power which be enlarge by certain past contingency and have be diminish by certain more recent contingency
in this instance loyalty to our own society be as rorty say in his essay postmodern bourgeois liberalism loyalty enough
""
""
it need be responsible only to its own tradition
""
such sentiment really prejudice nonetheless leave rorty in a awkward position
in a book that seek among other thing to spell out for the postmodern era the new term of the social compact he seem to be defend what look like ethnocentrism
clifford geertz in what have already become a classic essay entitle the use of diversity charge that rorty be in fact try to make a response from rorty on ethnocentrism a reply to clifford geertz that go a long way toward clarify what remain problematic about rorty s insistence on maintain the distinction between the individual and the social the personal and the political or what he call in the essay just name private narcissism and public pragmatism
a exchange that be center on what rorty mean by antiantiethnocentrism it turn essentially as i read it around two question
the first be whether selfknowledge and thus the quest through redescription for individual realization be at all possible without learn how to think rather differently about the social other
the second be whether procedural justice as rorty would practice it be for the liberal a satisfactory antidote to the social misery cause both by our innate proclivity to be cruel and by our equally habitual inattention to suffer when it occur in place or among people unfamiliar to us
to take them one at a time there be way rorty divorce selfknowledge from social awareness
one derive from the character of contemporary experience itself where the social boundary between self and other between familiar and foreign between private and public have now become infinitely more blur boundaryless and fluid than they once be
with foreignness now begin at the skin s edge as geertz put it rather than the water be experience have take on the aspect of a enormous collage make the world
""
""
at each of its local point
""
""
look more like a kuwaiti bazaar than like a english gentleman s club
rorty agree but insist that the development of the bazaar have not bring a end to the club for gentleman
if anything it have only make the virtue of the club that much more apparent after a hard day s haggling in which you smile a lot and make the best deal you can they offer a place of retreat where you equal
""
rorty thus remain undaunted by the prospect that contemporary existence have turn into a exotic marketplace where most of the participant would rather die than share the belief of many of those with whom they must haggle
while this social situation will never encourage the creation of the kind of community long for by liberalism s critic the gemeinschaft of a robert bellah or a alisdair macintyre it will certainly not discourage the creation of a civil society of the democratic sort
all you need rorty add be the ability to control your feeling when people who strike you as irredeemably different show up at the hotel de ville or the greengrocer be or the bazaar
geertz on the other hand be of the opinion that such control will prove a very inadequate instrument of social cohesion when the liberal discover that the club have also be politicize and now confront him or her with the same social situation represent by the bazaar a world compose of irremovable
a second reason for geertz s skepticism be that even if we think we live in a society where social and cultural boundary still remain carefully draw and comfortably coincident the real boundary of the self as arthur danto point out in a article on which geertz draw be define instead by the gap between me and those who think differently than i which be to say everyone and not simply those segregate by difference in generation sex nationality sect and even race
without a perception of such gap and the asymmetry they represent we have no way of discover as geertz put it at what sort of angle
""
""
we stand to the world
and lack such knowledge we be powerless either to determine where we really be or what it feel like to occupy such a place or whether on reflection we might like to change our location
thus geertz conclude
to obscure those gap and those asymmetry difference mere unlikeness which be what ethnocentrism do and be design to do
""
""
be to cut us off from such knowledge and such possibility the possibility of quite literally and quite thoroughly change our mind
this would be a less damaging criticism if rorty s position be nt everywhere predicate on the possibility of our know who we and they be and of be able to change our mind through redescription if we want to
but it do nt seem to bother rorty in the least because he be convinced that such distinction and desire depend not on destroy ethnocentrism but rather on maintain it
to wet liberal presumably like geertz the supposition that the exclusivity of the private club might be a crucial feature of a ideal world order will undoubtedly look like a betrayal of the enlightenment
to dry liberal like rorty by contrast it be the enlightenment that originally betray us by encourage us to nature and shared moral aspiration
if we abandon hope for a universal culture base upon a univocal sense of the human we will then see as thick describer like geertz himself have teach us that such exclusivity be merely a necessary and proper condition of selfhood and one that when assume by a liberal we such as our own a we that have be raise to be suspicious of ethnocentrism to begin with may well prove to be just what be need to keep the bazaar open to keep the institution of procedural justice function
""
this bring us to the second point of contention between geertz and rorty which have to do with whether procedural justice as presently conceive be a adequate instrument for the relief of human suffering and humiliation
rorty clearly think it be but admit that some club like ours will view procedural justice as a moral commitment while others eg theirs will construe it simply as a matter dubious and offer as a example of its cultural and moral limitation the case of the drunken indian and the kidney machine
this case turn on the conflict between a native american who be unwilling to abandon his alcoholism after be place on dialysis and the medical protocol govern the use of such therapy a conflict that reflect deep moral assumption on the part of society generally about who deserve to have access to the therapy
so far as geertz be concerned the point of the story be that the lack of understand on both side of this divide about what it mean to be on the opposite side prevent either party from understand even its own position
while to be sure a rough kind of justice be serve inasmuch as the indian be permit to stay on the machine until he die all sort of procedure have to be waive because of the general social inability to understand variant subjectivity and therefore to comprehend why the rule must often be change to accommodate new however geertz s reading manage to get thing pretty much reverse
whatever measure of justice be achieve in this case and it be as much he think as could be decently hope for result directly from the integrity and not the deficiency of the procedure involve
far understanding of moral diversity and asymmetry would have only get in the way
rorty be therefore cheer rather than depressed by this little fable
to him it show just how well the system work when the task of understanding of know how the indian s victimization at the hand of white together with his own ethnic tradition may have contribute both to his alcoholism and to his rebellion be leave to the connoisseur of diversity or agent of love as rorty somewhat patronizingly describe ethnographer novelist journalist and their kind and when the task of social implementation of make sure that everyone get treat the same once they have be demarginalized be leave to the as he describe the lawyer politician and businesspeople who run the system
rorty be eager to keep around lots of the agent of love because he know that they be essential to enlarge the liberal sense of we
and yet he be convinced that the world would not function at all without a abundance of the agent of justice if only because the bias of their own liberal procedure particularly if they be ironist have the practical advantage of allow individual and culture to get along together without intrude on each other s privacy without meddle with each other s conception of the good
""
rorty s position about the indian and dialysis like his view of solidarity generally be of a piece with his desire to move the enlightenment tradition away from its original concern with rationalism right and moral obligation and toward a more liberal concern with finitude contingency and redescription
this be a move design to turn solidarity into a matter rather than a recognition of something antecedently share
the problem with this aspiration be that rorty be of two mind about which detail however meticulously describe might make other self seem one of us and he resist the idea that thick describer like novelist possess any magical formula for make such detail move us
in the last chapter of contingency irony and solidarity for example as well as in the essay on ethnocentrism the detail that seem to matter most to him be those which stress the most obvious resemblance between us and them those that suggest a shared membership in the same set of club ethnic economic social political religious
in most of the rest of the book however the more salient detail appear to be those that speak to our common vulnerability to adversity
either way rorty see little or no bearing on our sense of solidarity of that entire spectrum of detail that stanley cavell thinking of call the ordinary
constituted of commonplace task and quotidian pleasure the ordinary may represent a range of experience we mostly take for grant but it be also a range of experience whose deprivation we can least afford to suffer because it be so closely tie to the sense humanity we share with others
such at any rate be the testimony of salman rushdie whose cruel confinement because of ayatollah khomeini s death sentence have rob him of such routine privilege as shop for grocery take a walk go to a movie browse at a magazine rack or drive a car what i miss be just that these tiny little thing
when you have them you think they be completely unimportant or even chore
""
""
but when you can nt do them you realize that in fact that be what life be that be real life
""
to say that people may possess more of a capacity to identify with the detail of dailiness than with the of mutual affiliation be neither to suggest that human being share a common nature nor to imply that thick describer such as novelist should abandon the effort to sensitize us to woe and hurt wherever they occur
it be merely to point out that for various psychological and cultural reason it may be more difficult to empathize much less sympathize with the painful and the pitiless than with the prosaic
rorty s myopia about this seem to follow from the distinction he posit everywhere but never quite manage to sustain except rhetorically between private hope and public responsibility between the demand of selfcreation and those of human bonding
it be a distinction he frequently try to enforce by associate it with other opposition that be equally indifferent to the claim of the ordinary like those between justice and love or irony and common sense or force and persuasion
as it happen all these distinction live a odd life in rorty s prose
whatever their function as counter in his argument they tend to absolutize these opposition he also absolutize their opposition or what amount to the same thing he rarely entertain the possibility that their opposition may itself be a product of contingency and may thus be in no sense philosophically or terminologically give
to concede that their relation be themselves contingent rorty would have to be more attentive to their historicity to the different kind of calculus that as critical coordinate they make possible in different discursive context and successive cultural era
would the historical record bear him out for instance in his contention that the vocabulary of selfcreation be always and inevitably private the vocabulary of justice always and necessarily public be nt this precisely the kind of distinction that have become so frequently blur unstable or occlude in if not before the postmodern fiction of a gabriel garcia marquez a jamaica kincaid a milan kundera a thomas pynchon or a nadine gordimer or to take another example in a world so wholly organize and coordinate in of other image a world where nationstate justify foreign policy as carlos fuentes have recently point out by appeal to the trope of individual selfdescription popularize by the frank sinatra lyrics about do it my way be it any long possible to differentiate clearly say between force and persuasion or between power and inducement or between indoctrination and influence why for that matter be common sense which charles saunders peirce associate with those idea and belief that man s situation absolutely force upon him so constantly identify with the husk of dead metaphor when so many historian of everyday life have just as often show it to represent the musculature of live one
these query raise troubling issue about the narrow or angled interpretation rorty give to some of his key term
his notion of the contingent for instance be curiously unweighted allow all particular historical contingency from the haphazard and accidental to the fated and inevitable to sink to the same level in affiliate with doubt skepticism and disbelief that it lose all contact with such related concept as the discrepant the gratuitous and the incongruous
it be for that reason never allow to curve toward the comic where we might well see how it serve as a corrective for the effect not only of essentialism but also of pride and stupidity
even rorty s notion of language suffer deformation when he assume that what wittgenstein mean by the claim that all feeling and thought be ground in a form of life be that the limit of our world have now be reduce to the limit of our language
as geertz have note in the use of diversity this be not exactly what the man say
""
what he say
""
""
be that the limit of my language be the limit of my world which imply not that the reach of our mind of what we can say think appreciate and judge be trap within the border of our society our that the reach of our mind the range of sign we can manage somehow to interpret be what define the intellectual emotional and moral space within which we live
this be why a increase in the number and kind of cultural symbol people be able to interpret can lead to a enlargement of the mind with which they try to grasp them a broadening of the sympathy with which they try to engage them
change the language people use the symbol they employ and you can as we have learn since the berlin wall come down alter the world they inhabit
but rorty want to keep these alteration within welldefined cultural and linguistic border
hence his skepticism about the possibility of any moment when as james and dewey maintain and richard poirier have more recently contend we can stand beyond language or at least beyond any of its conventional mediation without necessarily stand beyond experience
rorty would take such moment to be symptomatic of the religious delusion that we can achieve think such moment presuppose or need represent be perceptual occasion no doubt often induce by language that currently resist incorporation within our traditionally inherit vocabulary and verbal technology
in any event whether describe as experience of the ineffable the undecidable or simply the vague they have long be of particular interest to the pragmatist philosophical tradition and be often produce as poirier have point out in the renewal of literature by the tropological behavior of language itself
indeed this be one way of describe the office of the strong poet someone whose redescription be predicate on the human ability through language to avail us of possibility for understand that transcend language
by remain distrustful of or indifferent to such capacity and the moment they make available to the imagination rorty be compel to reduce severely the heuristic value of art and particularly the novel to a largely diagnostic function either to reveal the seed of cruelty within ourselves or to disclose hidden site of pain and suffering
what get lost project be something more than art s capacity to describe all that james agee mean by the radiance of what be
what disappear be the belief that art poetry fiction can sometimes lift us out of ourselves as when we see or feel experience or a portion of it from the perspective of another
solidarity can be achieve in no other way
and no proposal for the renovation of intellectual inquiry and the reformation of society as ambitious or acute as rorty be can furnish us with sufficient mastery of our postmodern predicament that do not show us how to enhance it

introduction property and freedom
although perhaps not terribly informative maurice cranston be nevertheless correct by definition a liberal be a man who believe in liberty at the core of every liberal theory be some case for individual liberty liberal may disagree about the nature of this case but there be little doubt that liberal theory be freedomcentered liberal have characteristically understand private property as complement and safeguard freedom insofar as personal holding define a sphere within which their holder enjoy the protected liberty to act as he may see fit
view from a different perspective however the complementarity of property right and liberty be problematic
in a wellknown essay alan gibbard observe
if a person own a thing his ownership enhance his liberty but it do so at the expense of the liberty of others
ownership of a thing give a person the fight to exclude others from its use and that right though it add to the freedom of the owner gibbard thereby point to a possible tension in the liberal case for private property
once my right to x be establish then i enjoy option with respect to the use or disposition of x that i previously lack
you however be now burden by a correlative obligation to defer to my decision concerning x as l t hobhouse remark the property that confer freedom on the owner may at the same time limit or destroy the freedom of another
 from the perspective of liberty then it would seem that the creation of the property right be at best a wash the apparent implication be that a advocate of freedom will have a difficult time justify property right on the ground that they be freedomenhancing
the very devotion to liberty that define liberalism may it would seem motivate abandonment or substantial qualification of a regime of robustly private property
in this essay we consider in just what way right to freedom relate to a right to property
gibbard and mort s property right to x do indeed restrict millie s liberty with respect to x such restriction be precisely the point of a recognition of right
however we claim this be not a special feature of property right as distinguish from other right nor do it somehow imply that freedom and property be in special conflict
the argument of the first three section of the paper support the judgment that property right be no more problematic within the context of liberal theory than other quintessentially liberal right such as freedom of speech
many theorist have however believe that the justification of title to private property diverge significantly from other strand of liberal justificatory theory
in the fourth section we offer a assessment of why these theorist take property to be different

right to freedom
""
hobbesian liberty and morality
in one respect all right indeed all morality limit liberty
we can imagine a liberty that preexists the moral boundary constitute by right including right to property
indeed hobbes have clone the imagine for us in his depiction of the state of nature
the fundamental law of nature he maintain be that naturally every man have a right to everything
 by right he understand simply the liberty to do or to forbear elsewhere hobbes describe this as our blameless liberty of use our own natural power and ability
 each then have a blameless liberty to do anything he must in order to promote his overriding concern namely his selfpreservation
since it be rational for each to act to preserve himself and since each have a blameless liberty to do whatever he must no one can be say to be blameworthy or irrational when his selfpreserving action impose harm on others
it be therefore neither absurd nor reprehensible neither against the dictate of true reason for a man to use all his endeavor to preserve and defend his body and the member thereof from death and reason that all man account to be do justly and with right
""
this condition of absolute premoral liberty lack two important feature of the liberty that obtain within a moralized sociality
first it do not ensure to individual the ability to live as pursuer of value and project
if each may exercise a blameless liberty to encroach on others in whatever way may seem requisite for improve one s survival chance the ability of each to pursue his project and value be gravely impugn
mort s bestlaid plan may and often will come a cropper to millie s conflicting design
life in such circumstance will not often afford to individual the opportunity to devote themselves in coherent fashion to longterm design
rather it will be a thoroughly grim affair memorably characterize by hobbes as solitary poor nasty brutish and short
 conversely general recognition of moral obligation not to encroach on the protected sphere of others ground the possibility of a freedom to pursue those this be a freedom that each agent typically have reason to prize there be a crucial sense in which those liberty consequent on the establishment of moral protection render individual significantly more free than they would be in their absence right so understand do augment freedom
second premoral liberty conflict with individual virtually inescapable conviction that they stand in a unique normative relation to their own action
to see this consider the situation of a hardy soul who despite hobbes s dour imprecation be inclined to give the regime of complete amoral liberty a try
hobbes of course insist that this would be foolhardy but he be a notorious pessimist concerning such matter
other of sunny mien may be more optimistic concerning their prospect in the state of nature
suppose then that mort decline the invitation to enter into a social contract with others
he thereby maintain his primordial liberty to pursue his end in whichsoever way he judge suitable and others possess a like liberty with regard to mort
direct his activity either by sheer force or threat he have no ground for complaint
mort may find himself enslave or imprisoned and yet he must admit that he have no basis for resentment or indignation to be sure he may be angry that they enslave him or surprised that they manage to do so
but what he can not do be claim that he occupy a privileged position visavis his own activity that they have wrongfully fail to respect
rather mort be oblige to acknowledge that they have as much entitlement to control mort s activity as he himself do
where only liberty obtain everything and everyone be fair game
it seem doubtful though that we can think of ourselves in this way
we take ourselves to be intimately relate to our own activity as something intrinsic to who and what we be rather than as some external thing in which both we and others might take a interest
nor do it seem sufficient to conceive of this special relation in purely descriptive but normatively neutral fact that it just so happen that your determination concerning how your arm and leg shall move typically correlate more closely with their subsequently observe motion than do my wish concerning the deportment of your limb
rather we maintain a special authority to direct our own activity a claim against others that all else equal they not undertake to subvert this control
if mort really want to give the hobbesian state of nature a try he not only must be prepare for others continually to frustrate his activity but he also must bring himself to concede that his own effort to determine the course of his activity be morally on a par with the attempt of others to control mott s doings
it be far from clear that this be something that he can simply will to do
to the extent that person be irremediably indisposed to adopt a detached stance toward their own activity they be rationally bar from espouse hobbesian amoralism
""
claim right to freedom
mott s difficulty point us who populate hobbes s state of nature
what can rightfully be describe as the liberal conception of a free person involve not only the bare power of a agent to act according to his own determination but also a claim against others that they not interfere
that is rather than assert a mere liberty to act the liberal person assert a claim right to act as he see fit 
claim right unlike the liberty of the state of nature restrict the freedom of others
if mort be at liberty to theta he be under no duty to refrain from thetaing it be not wrong for him to theta
but if all that mort enjoy be a liberty it be not wrong for millie to interfere with his thetaing
should he however assert a claim right to theta he maintain that millie be under a duty not to interfere
claim right unlike mere liberty attempt to demarcate a region of moral space against which others may not encroach
now acknowledge it she be from one perspective at least a loser from the transaction
to be restrict be all else equal to be render bad off and it be specifically to be bad off with respect to one s liberty
that be the sense in which all claim right be intrinsically libertydiminishing
but of course all else need not be equal
restriction on liberty can render available good other than liberty and thus from the perspective of the individual be judge a good bargain
yet more significantly they can generate a class of liberty unknown in the state of nature morally protected liberty
therefore even from the perspective of liberty alone the acceptance of restriction can be rationally advisable although theory of liberal right differ among themselves in many important way each affirm that some restriction of premoral liberty be warrant
more precisely each maintain that wouldbe right claimant be able to justify those restriction to the individual call on to forbear right to theta be himself better off than he be in the hobbesian state of nature
he retain his liberty to theta and join to it a assurance that others will not obstruct his action
from his perspective the claim right be freedomenhancing
but from millie s perspective mort s claim right be freedomrestricting if mort have a claim right to theta then she must not interfere with his thetaing
why should she accede to this restriction
mott s justificatory task be to provide millie with some good reason for give up her hobbesian liberty to interfere
and of course the traditional liberal answer be that millie too benefit from a moral regime although she lose her liberty to interfere with mort s thetaing she gain claim right of her own which in turn restrict mott s liberty in some area
that is they stand symmetrically with respect to what be gain and what be forgone
if the justificatory engine run smoothly it will turn out that each civil society be justifiable to each from the person s own perspective 
""
property right and other freedom
it be important to stress that the foregoing consideration apply with full generality to all putative claim right not simply those that involve holding in property
to see that that be so consider the right to freedom of speech
it be apparent that what gibbard say about entitlement to property equally apply to freedom of speech if a person have a right to speak as he see fit that will enhance his freedom but it will correspondingly restrict the freedom of others
mott s rightful liberty to utter and publish and promulgate blasphemous thesis entail a absence of liberty on the part of the disapproving cleric to censor mort or cast him in prison as punishment for the offense he cause
that be not to say anything noteworthy about the nature of speech but it be to characterize the logical structure of a right
if right be a normative resource they enhance the opportunity in this regard freedom of speech be no different from any other right it restrict the freedom of others to act
we maintain then that what hold for right in general apply without additional qualification to property right they enhance the freedom of the possesor to act as he see fit
but if so then it would seem that the observation that mort s property right restrict millie s freedom do not indicate something uniquely awkward or exceptional about property right that require a justificatory strategy over and above that which generate other liberal right
if we be correct then those commentator who hold property right to be especially problematic have misconceive their status
because this misconception be widespread however its source merit closer attention
""
worry about the foundation of property right
""
common property and private property
gibbard suggest that property holding may be problematic insofar as they disturb a initial moral order in which everything be open to common use
he write
everyone let can lose a natural fight only by a voluntary act such as agree to give that right up or forfeit it through violate the right of someone else now what be one s natural right with respect to thing for my purpose i shall need only a vague answer to this question i shall suppose that everyone have equal right to the use of all things 
the implication seem to be this if everyone have equal right to the use of all thing then mort s claim of a exclusive right to the use of some particular thing stand in violation of the natural right of everyone else
gibbard s supposition be questionable in several respect
first it be unclear what gibbard mean by a natural right
one thing he might mean be that natural right be justifiable to agent in virtue of their interest or belief or desire but foundational of other conventional or subsidiary right derivative therefrom
so understand however there do not even the vague characterization that gibbard supply
before we can understand which right might be foundational in this sense we need to understand the avenue of justification through which they be elicit and gibbard quite deliberately aim to evade that requirement
second the scope of thing be unclear
presumably the term be mean to exclude agent themselves as well as their action and undetached bodily part and to include tangible entity external to them such as land and chattel
unless some such distinction be implicit the supposition that everyone have equal right to the use of all thing be thoroughly implausible
as be argue in section mort be not likely to accept the suggestion that everyone have equal right to the use of mort s spleen or to decide whether mort will offer a deconstructionist analysis of leviathan at the philosophy department picnic
these be matter concerning which he will take himself to possess some distinctive unequal authority
but once one concede the absence of equal right over person with respect to all else become dubious
if mort believe that he have reason to claim special authority with respect to his own body he be unlikely to accede to a decision procedure in which everyone have a equal say concerning the disposition of the food that mort have forage or raise for the sustenance of the body that be his
similarly a agent who believe himself entitle to press a claim for privileged status with respect to his own action have reason to extend that claim to his use of those external thing requisite for action minimally the ground on which he stand while act
these fact about the tight relation between control thing and one s enablement as a agent be not obscure and their normative thrust seem to be quite different than that which gibbard imply
the egalitarianism that suggest itself be not one of equal right to the use of all thing but rather a equal propriety on the part of each agent to demand unequal title to some thing
third and most serious there
do he intend claim right right with concomitant restriction on the liberty of others or do he have in mind something like a purely hobbesian liberty that carry no restriction the former be thoroughly implausible
locke can assume a initial position of some sort of common ownership because he postulate that god have give the earth to all man in common
absent that theological premise or one of equivalent power there be no basis for posit a moral order of delicately equalize claim right and concomitant restriction
rather the only equality that might be take as antedate any particular system of parcel out morally protected claim be the equality of norestraint that vex hobbes and for which he understand political order to be the solution
in other word in the absence of what for locke be literally a deu ex machina no ground exist for commence with a universal socialism from which all subsequent movement toward other pattern of property in thing originate
the problem for those not encumber or favor get from one relatively inefficient system of ownership to another that be its paretosuperior but rather of demonstrate that where previously there be no restraint all have good reason to accept a system of restraint
""
consent and the creation of new obligation
if it be implausible to suppose a moral starting point of everyone possess equal fractional claim right to all thing we might consider instead whether gibbard have in mind the sort of negative communism describe by jeremy waldron
perhaps the original community of good do not actually involve any claim
right at all which might stand in the way of private appropriation but only and at most hohfeldian privilege such as the privilege of make use of the resource god have provide
on this account each individual would be at liberty to use any resource in the sense that he would have no duty not to do so but nobody at least initially would be conceive to have any right capable of generating duty on others be interested 
prima facie it be hard to see how gibbard s consent requirement can be base on mere liberty
if both mort and millie have a liberty to use x neither be morally beholden to the other
millie s liberty in no way restrict the range of mort s permissible action and so he do not need millie s consent to use x in whatever way he choose
gibbard explicitly insist however that mort s acquisition reqires millie s consent and he also seem to understand the natural right to the equal use of all thing as a liberty
within limit i shall suppose a person have a right to consume thing and to transform one thing into another
such act change the position of others by change the world physically and thereby deny other people opportunity they would otherwise have
my right to do such thing may well be limit
i do not though invariably need another person s consent to change the physical world do need his consent to bring him under new moral constraint to make it cease to be morally permissible for him to do certain thing that he can do or to make it morally permissible to coerce him in certain ways 
the point seem to be this
mort do not need millie s consent to exercise his liberty to use x even if as a matter of fact his exercise of that liberty mean that x be not available for millie to use
her opportunity be physically limit but her moral status have not be alter
but if mort claim a property right to x he not only claim that he be at liberty to use it but also that millie be under a new moral duty not to use it
that be where the need for millie s consent seem to enter
one may unilaterally transform thing but not the moral status of other person
three feature of gibbard s argument merit comment
 his conclusion be sound only by consent
if the only way to justify a duty be through the consent of the person bind by the duty then mort must get millie s consent if he be to justify his claim that she have a duty to refrain from use x but that be highly controversial
most of us will acknowledge that we be bind by duty that do not stem from some initial act of consent on our part to that duty
only by awkwardly slice the concept of consent into various hypothetical and tacit mode can one render even remotely plausible the proposition that all justification be to be construe as issue from consent
 but even if gibbard be right even if consent alone justify the imposition of duty he still have not demonstrate that there be anything especially problematic about duty to respect property
all moral duty would turn out to be contingent on obtain the ongoing consent of people
mort s liberty to speak his mind free of millie s censorship require her acquiescence as fully with a item of property in his possession
 a consent requirement for the existence of duty engender anomaly in intergenerational transaction
gibbard himself point out that one problematic aspect of his account of property right be that new adult enter the moral community will enjoy disproportionate bargaining advantage
people live through different though overlap period of time
now if anyone who have not agree otherwise have a right to use thing on the same basis as everyone else agreement make by others before a person be born to which he be not a party can not remove that right
when a child reach adulthood when that is he first become competent to make agreement he have the same right to equal use of all thing as he would have if everyone be in a state of nature
he can lose that fight only by agree to give it up
what happen then when a child first grow competent to make agreement if others have produce a very strong bargaining position
for abjure his natural right to equal use of scarce good such as cleared land stored food and housing the new adult can exact a high price 
once again the talk of equal right be confusing suggest as it do that one agree to give up a claim fight
but on the only plausible interpretation one give up a liberty ie one accept a duty
if the justification of moral duty require that each new adult must consent to the entire moral code then a system of claim right to property yield counterintuitive implication
however the implication concerning all other claim right be similarly unpalatable new adult can exact a high price for their compliance
their elder presumably have develop a settled way of life and expectation base on this code and would incur a considerable cost rather than give it up
so mort jr
can with good prospect of success put the following proposition to mort sr your property holding in return for of same and if you throw in a additional i will accept a obligation not to censor your speech or stone you for blasphemy
this we think stand as something of a reductio ad absurdum of the assumption that only the actual consent to a set of duty by each new moral citizen can justify such duty
""
waldron on the unilateral creation of obligation
jeremy waldron have recently voice a criticism of property right theory that share much with gibbard s complaint
according to waldron a theory of justice in acquire right to property stipulate a action or a set of action a such that anyone who perform a with respect to some resource ipso facto become the owner of the resource
 such a theory then maintain that by perform some act a with respect to resource xxr mort can unilaterally place the rest of the world under a obligation to refrain from use xxr that is mort have add by some unilateral action of his own waldron think that such a conception of obligation creation be unfamiliar and be distinctly uneasy about obligation that others might thrust on one in this way 
we find such obligation more familiar than do waldron
consider the obligation to render to people thatwhich they deserve
if millie be the head of the philosophy department and mort be a exceptional member of it his performance be apt to pile obligation on millie
when it come time to award merit increase approve leave application etc she will find herself obligate to give mort what he deserve
thus through his own action mort generate obligation on millie
one may think that this case be different
mort and millie be operate within a system to which both have consent
but have they probably not
in any event the desert claim be embed in a overall system that can be justify to both party and that be why mort s action within no doubt
but surely this must be true of any plausible system of property right as well
individual will through their unilateral action exercise a moral power of alter others obligation with respect to item of property
that will be so only if the system within which they acquire use transform and convey holding be itself morally justifiable but again we emphasize that this requirement of justifiability in no way distinguish property right from other liberal right
one suspect that both waldron and gibbard think differently when they consider natural right it seem that they suppose that these be right that stand in no need of justification
if so one might properly doubt their existence
restriction impose cost on those so bind
it be flatly irrational to accede to the imposition of cost on oneself unless one have reason to acknowledge that do so be justifiable
certainly the declaration that suchandsuch a cost be natural be not to provide any such reason
if be simply unsupported assertion that others be bind because i have thetaed then waldron would be correct in criticize the associated duty as suspicious and unfamiliar
but as should be clear by now all right property or otherwise impose burden and so stand in need of justification
if there be a clear sense to be make of property fight be less natural or more dependent on consent than be other liberal right its source must be seek elsewhere
""
convention and consequentialism
there exist a persistent strand of the liberal tradition that ascribe to property right a conventional status not share by other liberal fight and conclude trax a justification of property right will be inform by consequentialist consideration to a extent not true of other right
thus larry alexander write
right to pursue one s project can be no more than negative liberty to be free from have one s body labor and talent appropriate by others in pursuit of their project
the right to do not guarantee any resource outside of one s person
any right to act in and on the world in any way that compete with how others wish to act in and on the world must be right derive from some impersonal consequentialist consideration 
alexander maintain then that property right be distinguish from other liberal right in that the former but not the latter must pass the bar of consequentialist scrutiny
society may establish at its discretion whatever rule and institution of control over property that it deem conductive to overall value maximization it be restrain only at the periphory of person body
we have already argue that it be implausible that individual who maintain a special authority over their own person and action will have reason to cede all such authority concerning those external resource that constitute for them the requisite of action
the consideration of personal value that underlie one s normative authority over one s body labor and talent do not lose their salience when attention be shift to item point however may be different
he may be take as maintain that there be a variety of societal form through which recognition could be give to individual interest in exercise control over external thing
no one of these stand out as obviously correct ie natural in yet another sense of the term
therefore it be reasonable that society adopt conventional norm of justice in holding that promise to conduce to overall wellbeing understand as consequentialistic maximization
no doubt alexander be correct in maintain that property right be conventional
one need only glance at a text on comparative property law or us statute concerning patent and copyright to be make aware of the fact that socially acknowledged system of right to property be permeate through and through with artifice
however a equally brief glance at a compendium of supreme court decision concerning the scope of the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech reveal something very similar
one can not simply read off the page of the great book of nature that a flag or dance nude in front of discriminating patron of the art be each protected speech over which the individual be properly sovereign but televised paean to the marlboro man be prohibitable for the sake of the great good
nor be there anything obviously natural in the fact that freedom of speech extend to soundtrucks at political rally in the park but not to those truck when they appraoch a hospital
right all right not just property right be ground in central human interest but take on the various particular form in which we observe them as a matter of convention
that be not to maintain that these conventional form be arbitrary that one determination about the proper bound of the exercise of speech or acquire use and convey property be as good as any other
convention themselves stand in need of justification in terms of how well or ill they conduce to the value they be intend to serve
however alexander have provide no reason to suppose that this justification take question be property right or other liberal freedom
rather we maintain that property right be to be understand as responsive to individual interest in lead their life according to their own light amidst a world of other people who similarly have a fundamental interest in direct their life in accord with their own value and project
this be to adopt a essentially anticonsequentialistic view of justification with respect to all liberal right
it may nonetheless seem that the convention define property right be uniquely contestable in a way that other right be not
vast political movement arise and contend with one another over question of how wealth be to be control moral philosopher who otherwise share a common commitment to liberal principle divide over whether property holding be to be distribute in accordance with a equality criteria a difference principle or laissezfaire allowance of unrestricted acquisition
in the face of such diversity one be tempt to conclude that there be something up for grab with respect to property right that do not similarly characterize other liberal right not as a entailment of the pure theory of right but rather as a commentary on the history of liberalism
many matter that move people in previous generation to take up arm no long sharply engage the passion and interest it be simply not a open question any long northern ireland aside whether papist be entitle to moral space within which they can give effect to their particular allegiance
within at least the democratic west and in recent month within nascently democratic central and eastern europe a substantial degree of consensus have be achieve concerning which activity fall within the protected sphere
it be important however that we overstate neither the extent nor the stability of such a consensus
liberal toleration be not without enemy who contend against it both in mass political movement and in the scholarly literature
nor be there anything in the logic of liberalism that generate the result say that one may permissibly elect to play golf on the sabbath but not to ing opiate
if might be both accidental and temporary
no conclusion should be draw that property right be either uniquely conventional or especially suit to toolong parcel out
""
the problem of original acquisition
""
the oddness of original acquisition argument
our analysis thus far have be negative insofar as we have argue that property right do not significantly differ from other liberal right with respect to both expand the sphere of protected liberty that individual can enjoy and require justification to the individual so bind by them
still the apprehension that the justification of property right be somehow singular may remain
that apprehension itself call for some diagnosis
common to several of the argument contend that property right be anomaly within liberal theory be the suggestion that it be specifically the origin of a right to private property that be dubious
that is critic seem to concede that be a system of property right satisfactorily inaugurate there would be little difficulty in understand how holding could properly be use transform sell or give away we decide to trade them between ourselves nothing have occur which strike at the interest or moral standing of the rest of the world
however if i claim previously unowned apple and you claim previously unowned orange we have thereby maintain against everyone else that they be no long permit to do with those apple and orange that which they previously be at liberty to do
thus it appear incumbent to offer a account of how right to property can originate originate without require the general consent of everyone or a divine decree that people take what be need from the state of nature so as to preserve themselves or a natural law of rightful appropriation that be selfjustifying
to this end philosopher offer argument from original acquisition
there be something strange about these argument
for most of the property we care about the story of its acquisition be ancient history at best and more likely ancient myth
why the propriety of contemporary practice should be deem to hinge on their dark nt it terribly odd to look into some remote past to see if our system of property be justifiable and can we ever know what we need to know jeremy waldron s question be good one
what be the condition like when resource be first take into ownership how well develop be moral consciousness be those to whom the principle be supposed to apply capable of implement it properly could it conceivably have be a principle which they hold and abide by explicitly or in any way if we turn from ancient to modem capability how can we make sense now of principle whose only direct application be hundred or perhaps thousand of year ago 
argument for private property base on a tale about original acquisition in longago time seem indeed to be a justificatory embarrassment
why would a philosopher tell such a story
""
a nonhistorical reinterpretation of the originalacquisition argument
here be one possibility
recall john stuart mill s claim that private property in every to individual of the fruit of their own labor and abstinence
 we thus might say that the heart of a millian defense of private property will be that property right ensure producer the fruit of their labor or we might say this be the telo of property rights if the telo of property right be to assure to producer the fruit of their labor then the regulative idea in the justification of property right be somehow to secure this link
different system may do so in different way and some system of property right may seek to accomplish other aim besides
but if mill be correct then any successful justification of property right must center on secure this link between production and control
now if this be one s view of property right then the justification of a system of property right must tie property right to the act of produce
in some way or another that is it must be the case that the system of property fight generally provide producer
so on such account the case for a system of property right will seek to demonstrate two thing that a system of private property provide producer with control over the fruit of their labor and that a institution which establish such a tie be justify
both be require for the success of the millian case for private property
a socialist for instance might accept but deny indeed it have be a common enough socialist complaint that a system of private property be a barrier to provide producer with control over the fruit of their labor
but suppose that someone deny 
consider that is a critic who deny that there be any reason to accept a institution that grant producer such special control
how might one argue in favor of the institution well one might endeavor to show that it be intuitively fit that producer control their product by attempt to isolate this tie from the host and one way to do that be to imagine a world in which there be no other claim to resource
in such a state of nature we could focus on the claim that production generate without be distract by preexisting claim over thing
we could imagine people labor on a world of unowned thing and then note that in such a world it seem that a person who labor gain special claim over thing such as acorn
and we might ask
when do they begin to be his when he digest or when he eat or when he boil or when he bring them home or when he pickt them up and t be plain if the first gathering make them not his nothing else could
that labor put a distinction between them and common
that add something to them more than nature the common mother of all have do and so they become his private right 
the suggestion then be that the continuing influence of and thus emphasize the tie between labor andor production and the claim to control the fruit of labor
as david miller a critic of lockean property right admit the tie between production and control over the fruit of labor do indeed seem most obvious in the simple fairly asocial condition depict in locke s state of nature and that we suggest be a basic appeal of stateofnature originalacquisition story they fix a spotlight on the intuition that producer deserve to own the fruit of their labor
so understand a original acquisition account of property need be no more historical than a political theory base on the concept of the state of nature or the social contract
although all three concept appear to display a historical dimension and be probably understand by their early exponent as at least partially historical their contemporary appeal be not historical
rather all three ie original acquisition the state of nature and the social contract be think experiment that induce us to view justificatory
to be sure this probably be not locke s intent
and robert nozick do indeed proffer a historical entitlement theory
but as lawrence becker point out a great deal of the continuing attraction of locke s theory seem to stem from a conviction that it somehow embody a principle of desert and indeed some have interpret locke s theory as base property on desert claim our reinterpretation of original acquisition argument apply to these lockeaninspired account
the crucial principle underlie these argument be not essentially historical that at some faraway time someone appropriate a piece of property
rather desertbased argument be essentially nonhistorical they insist that the telo of a system of property right be to link productive labor and control over good
the tale about original acquisition function to emphasize this telos
""
a lingering problem
as we say a millian account of property right must justify two claim that a system of private property provide producer with control over the fruit of the such a tie be justify
we have suggest that one way and the most interesting way a original acquisition tale function be to justify the claim that worker deserve the fruit of their labor
but it be precisely here that original acquisition account of property seem to confront a justificatory challenge that distinguish them from argument for other liberal right
contrast 
a all who perform action theta deserve right xxr
b all individual in the polity be entitle to right xxr
it seem that argument for liberal right typically correspond to b they be universalistic in the sense that all individual in the polity be entitle to right of free speech association occupation and so forth
one do not have to do anything to earn such right indeed that be one of the point of insist that they be universal right
but a argument for property base on desert conform to a to simplify it assert that only the productive or the hardworking properly merit rights do not theta or who do not theta very well accept the claim of thetaers that thetaers deserve special claim over resource unlike freedom right where liberal typically claim that everyone possess the right type a justification of property do not necessarily suppose that all be thetaers or equally good at thetaing
the question thus arise how be thetaers to justify their claim to nonthetaers
perhaps thetaers can show all others that everyone thetaers and nonthetaers alike accept the appropriateness of give say worker control over the fruit of their labors or alternatively it might be show that even nonthetaers benefit from a system that allow thetaers special claim over resource
this we take it be one interpretation of locke s famous claim echo by adam smith that a king of a large and fruitful territory in america where individual appropriation of land have not commenced feed lodge and be clad bad than a day labourer in england
 the day to whom a property holder must justify himself the day laborer apparently do not obtain benefit from the system of private property
but if locke and smith be correct he do obtain benefit he the bad of in a society with private property be better off than the bestoff person in a state without appropriation
if so that do seem to be a reasonable if not conclusive justification of private property
thus it seem that argument make say production the ground of property right do indeed face a special justificatory problem they must justify the system of property right to those uninterested in or unable to perform the relevant activity
this we suspect be the worry behind gibbard s insistence on consent perhaps the producer need to obtain the consent of the nonproducer
and it be probably at the root of the unilateral feature of property claim that so trouble waldron why should producer be able unilaterally to put nonproducer under obligation but the real problem right of thetaers to property must be justify to all on whom they impose moral demand
""
conclusion
do property right pose a special justificatory problem we have argue in this paper that for the most part they do not
most of the socalled special problem of property be simply particular case of the general requirement that claim right be justify to those on whom they impose obligation
we have show that critic of liberal property right typically hold these right to be dubious because they stand in need of justification though these same critic elsewhere in relation say to free speech accept a equivalent justificatory requirement as unproblematic
we have however trace some of the purported special problem of property back to original acquisition argument
the status of these argument be not always pellucid but we have endeavor to provide a interpretation of originalacquisition narrative that plausibly represent them as raise some justificatory question not encounter elsewhere in liberalism property many have say reward the industrious how able to take advantage of the opportunity present by a regime of property right but if that be the special problem that some liberal theory confront it hardly seem insuperable

the problem
property typically come to us by transfer from previous owner
all property however eventually trace its existence as property to appropriation of previously unowned good
so whether property can be justified apparenty depend on whether original approprition can be justify
under what condition then can remove natural resource from the commons be justify the standard answer be john locke s
labor be the unquestionable property of the labourer no man but he can have a right to what that be once joyned to at least where there be enough and as good left in common for others
""
so the way to remove resource from the common stock be to mix one s labor with them thereby annex them to one s person
a problematic idea to be sure but what interest me be how locke qualify it however one go about remove good from the commons one only unequivocally establish title to those good if one s
this qualification upon what one can originally extract from the commons be now know as the lockean proviso
virtually no one to my knowledge believe that any particular act of initial appropriation in a world of scarcity stand much chance of satisfy the lockean proviso judith jarvis thomson once put it this way
i suspect that there be no plausible construal of what locke have in mind by enough and as good under which anyone be take land for himself would leave enough and as good for all the other owner
for one thing locke do not realize how large the class of owner be go to be
i therefore suspect that if we take leave enough and as good as a necessary condition for property acquisition then it will follow that there can be no private ownership of land 
jeremy waldron concur
if the enough and as good clause be a necessary condition on appropriation it would follow that in these circumstance by starvation and exposure of them all distribution by consent be rule out practically and ex hypothesi since no appropriation would leave enough and as good in common for others 
likewise rolf sartorious say this understand as a original limitation on the right to appropriate natural resource the condition that there be enough and as good left for others could not of course be literally satisfy by any system of private property right
""
we compound the problem as john t sanders explain if we suppose quite reasonably that the proviso require us to leave something for our child as well as for each other
in particular if you consider all future generation and if you must leave enough and as good for every future human being then it be hard to imagine that the proviso would allow you to mix your labor with much more than a infinitesimal slice of land
""
the view of thomson waldron sartorius and sanders come political philosophy ever get
john arthur add that if one approach the problem of resource acquisition from the perspective of the lockean proviso that enough and as good must be leave in common then the typical method of acquire property under capitalism be unjust
""
if arthur be right the implication be farreaching indeed
if no initial acquisition at all can be legitimate private holding be illegitimate in principle
a stolen bicycle even if it be freely give to you by a generous thief be not yours to keep the illegitimate step in the process cast a shadow across all subsequent transaction
a illegitimate original acquisition would similarly infect all subsequent transfer
""
sanders take a similar view of the issue s significance
that some initial claim to property be defensible be require by any theory that hold that certain present distribution may be justify that certain transfer of property be justify or that restitution ought to be make for previous injustice in transfer or acquisition be crucial to the remainder of property theory 
the apparent impossibility of satisfy the proviso then have genuinely startling implication
private property moreover be only one of many institution whose legitimacy be call into question by this line of argument
the appropriation of land by worker commune be subject to the same objection
likewise reserve a campsite in a crowded national park also fail to leave enough and as good for others as do the use of public property in general when such property be subject to rationing or crowd
restriction on immigration be problematic for the same reason by institute them we fail to leave enough and as good for those who as a result find themselves on the outside look in
the above institution be all way of establish control over territory
in particular they establish the power and assume the right to restrict access to territory to which access have once be unrestricted which be to say that they remove such territory from the commons
appropriate acquire etc good from the commons by establish control over them in particular establish the power to exclude others from consume those good
if private property fall to the objection that original appropriation can not be justify it fall as a method of restrict access to the commons and all method of restrict access to the commons fall along with it
unless we be willing to admit that no such institution can be legitimate we seem force to dismiss the proviso as at best a sufficient but not necessary condition on appropriation that be impossible to satisfy should be ignore
indeed sanders have a powerful argument that ignore it be exactly what we should do 
against the idea that we should ignore the proviso consider that in propose the proviso locke be already retreat from the usual criteria of legitimate property transfer which require that transaction be consensual
the retreat be necessary because a wouldbe original appropriator can not obtain the prior consent of previous owner before be no previous owner
nor do anyone have the kind of claim to the resource that prior owner would have so there be no reason to suppose that anything as strong as prior consent be normatively require to legitimize original appropriation
yet locke be right to think something must be do to justify original appropriation for such appropriation seize exclusive control over that to which others previously have unrestricted access
especially under condition of scarcity such seizure have to be justify
locke be also basically on target in specify the nature of the required justification that is one should not appropriate good from the commons without stop to consider what one be leave for others
robert nozick agree say that any adequate theory of justice in acquisition will contain something like the proviso the trouble be as xxj h bogart say under condition of scarcity every acquisition worsen the lot of others and worsen their lot in relevant way
 the problem with the proviso be that contrary than the requirement that one obtain the prior consent of others
both appear to be test that original appropriation can not possibly pass
suppose it really be necessary for original appropriation to satisfy the proviso
would justifying original appropriation be possible i think so
moreover i do not think it become hard for original appropriation to satisfy the proviso as good become more scarce
in fact i will argue that far from never permit us to remove good from the commons the proviso may sometimes require us to remove scarce good from the commons
i do not claim that locke himself intend the proviso to be read as i will read it
nevertheless i beleive the proviso should be read this way for this reading capture a crucial truth about the condition under which property be legitimate

apple
a group of us find ourselves instantiate in a valley full of various kind of apple tree some already bear ripe fruit
find ourselves hungry we commence pick and eat so as other tree begin to ripen a few of us jump the gun and pick the best apple before they be quite ripe and the rest of us rush in fear that we will otherwise lose out entirely
thing get bad and eventually we find ourselves pick fruit before it be really edible
if we do not someone else will snatch it first and by the small of margin we would rather have little green apple tha none at all
tired of this degrading affair and of be underfed one of us build a fence around a single blossoming tree
none of the rest of us pay much attention to her until the day approach when her tree be the only tree we have yet to prematurely ravage will bear the only ripe apple in the valley
there be those of us who think about kill her in her sleep
but there be others who decide that her idea be a good one and follow suit while there be still time of us in group claim plot jointly adopt various way of share the cost and benefit of joint management
the detail of our arrangement be not important here for the task at hand be to justify original appropriation in general rather than to justify any particular kind of property institution
""
then group ii come along
they find some tree fence off bear lots of ripe fruit
the rest of the tree have be destroy
we tear them down try to eat the bark
group ii approach the fencedoff tree and
ask us where group ii s tree be
we say there be no tree for group ii
group ii say but we be hungry
we say no problem
grab those old dead tree over there and make fencepost
we will trade apple for them
group i say all right but there be many group yet to come
there be nt enough apple to feed them all
famine be like we begin to tremble a bit
well except for the original fence builder that be
she be think about the new fencepost industry and how it will facilitate the reclamation and rehabilitation of land for agricultural use
the end of our story find her busy collecting apple seed
the moral of the story be this
as latecomer arrive and natural resource become scarce anything leave in the commons will be level
this much be not news at least not to reader of garrett hardin what really be news be this leave good in the commons fail to satisfy the proviso
in fact leave good in the commons practically ensure their ruin
the essence of the tragedy of the commons what make it tragic be precisely that not enough and as good be leave for others
as a necessary condition for satisfy the proviso good must be remove from the commons
moreover the more severe the scarcity the faster resource will be destroy in will require that resource be remove from the commons
needless to say there be more than one institutional framework that can effectively remove good from the commons range from private property to public property to national border
for present purpose this make no difference
we be not try to decide which institution be most effective or even which be justify but only that the establishment of exclusive control which they all presume can be justify
at any rate there be no incentive to nurture apple tree in the commons
in the commons the fruit of production so to speak belong to others as much as to oneself
if one do not want to starve one be better off spend one s time eating while one can rather than produce
if only we have the power to decide how everyone will act
there might not be any point in remove resource from the commons
we could satisfy the proviso by choose for everyone to abide by principle ourselves not for everyone
and what people should choose for themselves differ from what would be right and from what the proviso would require if they be choose for everyone
what do this general point imply about the commons the commons might never be level if we could choose for everyone to leave enough and as good for others but the fact that people choose for themselves make a difference to what count as leave enough and as good for others
to decide that everyone will leave a piece of land alone would be to protect it to decide to leave it alone oneself be merely to leave it unprotected
in the commons we could naively restrain ourselves wait our turn and then eat only our share
but it would nt help
those who do otherwise will still precipitate the tragedy of the commons
our only choice in this unfolding tragedy would be these join in the mad rush to mutual starvation refuse to join the rush and be the first rhetorically and otherwise
only if some people successfully implement the latter choice be there any chance of the proviso be satisfy
be those who initially catalyze this mad rush do something wrong of course in particular they be violate the proviso
but whether their action be right or wrong be not really the point
the point be that until access to the land be restrict people will have the opportunity and the incentive to overuse it and some of them as a matter of fact will overuse it thereby not leave enough and as good for others
a moral agent have to take this into account when decide how to go about ensure that there will be something leave for her child
and simply allow the commons to go to ruin at the hand of other forager most emphatically be not the way to ensure that something will be leave for her child
if one be to satisfy the proviso in a way that have some positive bearing on the preservation of mankind one as it apply to thing like apple ie food
but if one merely appropriate apple one be not satisfy the proviso with respect to apple
those who appropriate apple from the commons violate the proviso on any interpretation of it insofar as it pertain to apple
they generate the tragedy of the commons
since appropriate apple ignore the proviso with respect to apple the tragedy create by those who appropriate apple alter what the proviso mean as a constraint on appropriation of land
in other word some alteration of the rule of access to apple be necessary if the proviso with respect to apple be to be satisfy
the proviso itself drive us to make this alteration and so our interpretation of the proviso must reflect the fact that it drive us to alter the rule of access to apple ie to restrict access to apple
specifically to appropriate land be to restrict access to apple
and restricted access to apple tend somewhat paradoxically to be a precondition proviso with respect to apple one must appropriate land rather than apple
hence land appropriation be not a violation of the proviso given that the proviso apply first and foremost to food under those circumstance but must instead be require by it
i will say more about the proviso with respect to land at the end of the following section
""
assumption
two assumption i make in derive this conclusion be worth discuss
first in require that enough and as good be leave for others i take the proviso to be refer to future generation as well as to the present one
as sanders put it what possible argument could at the same time require that the present generation have scruple about leave enough for one another while shrug off such concern for future generation 
locke think the point of property be that it help preserve mankind which he undoubtedly mean to include future generation
this do not mean locke also intend the proviso s reference to the suggestion be surely a strong one
moreover if locke do not think of the proviso as protect future generation he should have and so should we
if we aspire to preserve mankind leave something for our own generation be not enough
the land must be save for future generation too
as scarcity rear its ugly head a given generation s preservation of the land for future generation discharge its obligation to satisfy the proviso in the only way that matter in the long run
and if we latecomer ourselves after all do not leave resource for the next generation we must somewhere along the line be fail to leave resource for others whether or not we read others as be define in terms of future generation
this be why i have insist that the proviso not only permit original appropriation which be a significant point in itself but actually require it
one might suppose that the proviso do not literally require original appropriation because lie down and die
perhaps this be right but if the intent of the proviso be to regulate original appropriation in such a way as to be conducive to the preservation of mankind then obey it simply by die miss the proviso s point
that be not to say member of the first generation will not sometimes rightly feel disadvantaged by appropriation of their contemporary perhaps even to the point where they wish their contemporary would lie down and die
nevertheless she who remove the first plot of land from the commons be do something the proviso require to be do by somebody because again tree leave in common be subject to ruinous overuse by those who do not care or can not afford to care give the logic of the commons about leave enough and as good for others
if someone object that he would rather have meet that requirement himself she can answer you be object to my do something that have to be do by someone
to do it and i pick me
you would have pick you which would have be similarly unobjectionable
but that be nt how it happen
""
he might well respond that he be nt object to her act of appropriation he be object to the way she distribute what she appropriate or the fruit thereof perhaps his argument be sound but in any event since his objection be not against the removal as such we have no quarrel with him here
he concede our point that people must acquire good to be able to save them for future generation
we concede his point that once one acquire good there be limit on what one can do with one s acquisition
for present purpose we leave open the possibility that among such limit be those pertaining to redistribution
moreover if population pressure be already severe enough to limit relative latecomer opportunity even in the first generation that mean population pressure will limit their opportunity whether or not appropriation be a living be a disappointment forage the commons elbow to elbow would hardly be a picnic
whether or not appropriation be allow relative latecomer all find themselves in the same position whatever generation they belong to either the land have already be appropriate or that which have not be appropriate can not be appropriate and be probably on the way to ruin
but when some of the land have be appropriate at least relative latecomer can hope to secure the opportunity to use land land that remain useful by trade their labor for it
those who appropriate land can see to it that something be leave for the future by assume responsibility for the land which mean assume the right to prevent those who would overuse it from do so
those who merely appropriate apple perform no such service
the proviso it should be note be a principle of justice pertaining to original acquisition not to rectify past injustice
the original situation be not fair and appropriate land do not appropriate land do not make it fair either
those who show up late in the race to appropriate land typically have little reason to suppose they would have do better by show up similarly late in the race to appropriate apple from the commons
on the contrary since the prize tend to be so much small in the commons they typically would do that much bad
that they have show up late through no fault of their own be something to consider when distribute prize
in contrast that they find themselves in the first kind of race rather than the second be something for which they should simply be thankful
my second assumption concern exactly what it be that must be leave for future generation
as our story go protect group ii s interest do not require that apple or tree or land be leave in common for group ii to build fence around but that the source of apple be preserve so that group ii will have something to eat
and it be a good for group ii
when that which be scarce be leave in the commons it will be overuse
to ensure that something worth have will be leave for group ii someone in the first group have to build fence around it
my second assumption then be that what future generation need be resource to use
they do not need resource to initially acquire
again this seem to be locke s intention more importantly it should be ours as well
latecomer arrive too late to acquire valuable land by original appropriation
if what be important be leave resource for use then leave resource for original appropriation be not necessary
thus leave land in the commons be not necessary
in fact it be imperative not to leave land in the commons give what will happen to it there
soon or later the only land worth have will be previously appropriated land
therefore the proviso can not be think of as provide for the preservation of opportunity to appropriation of land inevitably leave less land in common for others to appropriate it must at least violate the proviso with respect to land even if violate the proviso in this respect be necessary if one be to satisfy the proviso with respect to apple
carol rose for instance concede that to be sure any appropriation diminish to some tiny degree the amount of a resource that be available to others
 but this concession be a crucial mistake
it be not true that appropriation of land inevitably decrease the amount of land available to others
it only inevitably decrease what be available for original appropriation by others which be not the same thing at all thus appropriation of land be not only require by the proviso with respect to apple but be also permit by the proviso with respect to land
""
contemporary holding
thomas mautner argue that theory of original appropriation have no contemporary relevance why not because even if we produce a workable criteria of just original appropriation be acquire in accordance with that criteria
but as a matter of fact the history of contemporary holding be generally lace with episode of force and fraud
nor do mautner think a theory of original appropriation would help in decide how to rectify historical injustice and i follow him in this respect
""
mautner s point be welltaken but my admittedly idiosyncratic reading of the proviso have a contemporary relevance that mautner do not anticipate
first a obvious point even today many resource be still largely hold in common
to give one example the coral reef of the philippine and tongan island be currently be ravage by destructive fishing technique
where fisherman once used lure and trap they now pour bleach ie sodium hypochlorite into the reef
partially asphyxiate the fish float to the surface and become easy prey
unfortunately the coral itself suffocate along with the fish and the dead reef cease to be a viable habitat
blastfishing also widely practice what go through the mind of these fisherman as they reduce some of the most beautiful habitat in the world to rubble perhaps some of them think quite correctly that if they do not destroy a given reef it will shortly be destroy by someone else so they might as well be the one to catch the fish
various group be try to save the reef by effectively remove them from the commons makng other group very angry in the process the issue of how such appropriation might be justify be of contemporary relevance if anything be
moreover my interpretation of the proviso imply that preserve the ecology of the reef should be regard as the pivotal issue which seem right on the mark to me
second and perhaps less obviously my argument also bear on resource that be appropriate long ago because it do more than show that thing could have work out so that original appropriation and subsequent history would have be legitimate even though it actually turn out otherwise
justify holding of course
nevertheless justify original appropriation do have the following critically important implication one can not in blanket fashion base claim of historical injustice on the a priori argument that current holding must after all have be originally acquire somewhere along the line
on the contrary claim of historical injustice must refer to the actual historical record of particular extant holding
third my argument suggest that there be a sense in which the proviso have justificatory significance over and above the role it play as a criteria of just original appropriation
consider that although remove good from the commons be necessary if good be to be preserve for future generation it be not sufficient for original appropriation by itself do not guarantee that good will be preserve for future generation
in other word original appropriation be require to satisfy the proviso and this fact suffice to justify original appropriation
but it do not suffice to justify any and all the way in which one s holding might be use fail to satisfy the proviso insofar as it pertain to the use of resource rather than to their initial acquisition
i will call this sense of the proviso the useproviso to stress the change of topic
we have be talk about the justification of property as a outgrowth of legitimate original appropriation
the useproviso in contrast concern the justification of property as a vehicle for preserving resource for the future the useproviso s satisfaction require that those who appropriate resource also practice in some sense ecologically sound management
satisfy the useproviso would mean that regardless of what have happen in the past a owner could claim that her holding be be properly care for and will still be there for future generation when she die
the useproviso s justificatory weight however much it have may be use to criticize as well as to defend current holding for renewable resource like forest and generally for resource that can be effectively use without be destroy like park land one ought to when one find it
for resource like oil that can not be effectively use without destroy them this requirement would be too strong
after all for good that can only be consume once someone will eventually have to deal with their already have be consume
so distant generation can not have the same claim to nonrenewable resource as proximate one
at most they will be able to point out that such resource should be replace by something as good and not necessarily the same kind of resource
of course this leave us with the problem of decide what as good amount to
one problem with this be that one person might claim while chop down redwood to make room for a hamburger franchise that he be leave enough and as good for others when everyone else agree he be simply spoil his land
in a similar vein we might ask if a person be inclined not to leave enough and as good for others when in the commons as good when it come to his own property undoubtedly a few owner will care so little about the future that they will ruin their own land despite the loss to themselves of its future value
and some tongan fisherman given ownership of a reef might prefer to destroy its future productivity for the sake of maximize a onetime harvest despite the fact that they will then be leave with nothing
nevertheless this lamentable folly be no reason for the rest of us to give such people the opportunity to ravage everything by leave it all in the commons
that they ruin their own property be bad enough
consider also that in the commons people have comparatively little incentive to save the land even if they do care about their future
even those tongan fisherman who would like to save the reef for their child continue to dynamite and poison the reef because as long as the reef remain in commons they do not have the option of choose between longrun and shortrun for themselves and shortrun gain for whoever show up next
exclusive control over a stream of benefit give us reason to maximize that stream s longrun value
once we lose control over this stream our incentive be to maximize the immediate value we can extract
this also hold if the future we care about be mankind be rather than our own
the property we save from ourselves can be preserve by us as we see fit but the commons we save belong to everyone and be subject to ruination by others whether or not we save it from ourselves
when one have control over a parcel of land its future and one s own be bind together as tightly as possible and this arrangement make the most of whatever tendency one have to care about the future
admittedly fence the commons be not a panacea
people sometimes ruin their own property
sometimes a injunction to care for it properly be needed but this be no reason to regret that the property have be the property be control by some identifiable party then at least there be some identifiable party who can be hold responsible for it
there be some person or group on whom the need injunction can be serve
""
conclusion
a key problem for the liberal theory of property concern the justification of initial acquisiton of resource from the common stock
my argument do not settle question of comparison among alternative property institution but it do settle that institution of exclusive control in general be immune to the sweeping objection that the initial acquisition of property can not be justify by the light of he proviso
in establish this my argument rebut a argument often level against private property but which apply equally to institution for establish exclusive control in general
if we should leave enough and as good for others we should above all leave enough and as good for future generation
to leave enough and as good for future generation we must above all protect them from presentday commons tragedy
remove resource from what we must preserve for future generation be opportunity to use resource not opportunity to originally appropriate them
this must be so because under condition of scarcity if we want resource to be there for future generation leave resource in the commons for them to remove on their own be out of the question
my interpretation of the proviso far from ruling out original appropriation actually require it

yale university
in this essay i seek to advance the philosophical defense of private property ie of private holding of extrapersonal objects the defense proposed vindicates holding as matter of right
i argue that each person have a natural right to the practice of private property which consist in a right that all others abide by a system of rule under which individual may peacefully acquire transform and otherwise exercise exclusive and discretionary control over extrapersonal object
there be no natural right to specific extrapersonal object or to any share of such object
rather particular entitlement to extrapersonal holding arise through the performance of those action designate as entitlementconferring by the system of rule to which individual have natural right
as individual be bind to comply with the rule constitute the practice of private property they be bind to respect the particular entitlement that arise within that practice i attempt to show how the natural right of property and in turn the specific entitlement to holding that arise under the institutionalization of that right fit within my argument in this essay like all moral argument about property do not stand on its own
rather it rest on more basic philosophical consideration in this case on a foundational argument for natural right only a sketch of which can be present here
i shall proceed in the following manner
first i shall outline the main contention of those more basic philosophical inquiry
second i shall introduce motivate and characterize a rightsbased version of classical liberalism which i shall then simply refer to as classical liberalism
this classical liberalism in essence combine a doctrine of selfownership with a endorsement of entitlementconferring procedure which sanction the division of the extrapersonal world into private domain
while the selfownership component be present as a consequence of the philosophical inquiry describe in section i at this early stage of exposition the sanctioning of the division of the extrapersonal world into private domain be present simply as a natural extension or concomitant of the selfownership component
third i shall characterize act theory theory
fourth i shall criticize the general adequacy of act theory of private property
fifth i shall motivate characterize and defend the practice theory of private property including its incorporation of the truth normally resident within act theories 
act theory and the practice theory represent alternative strategy for justify private property within the classical liberal perspective
act theory support the coherence of classical liberalism by depict entitlement to private holding as arise solely through the exercise of selfownership or some aspect of selfownership
the practice theory support the coherence of classical liberalism by found entitlement to private holding in part on the exercise of selfownership but more importantly in part on a companion natural right of property which share a philosophical base with selfownership
if this essay advance the program of a rightsbased classical liberal account of private property in extrapersonal object it do so through its development of the contrast between act and practice theory and in its far elucidation and defense of the practice theory from the point of view of high drama theory do not make its full appearance until the fifth section of this essay

agentrelativity and selfownership
i have argue elsewhere for a version of moral individualism that display two distinct yet interconnect facets the first facet be the agentrelativity of value
what be of value what provide individual with goaloriented reason for action be essentially personally individuate
a given end e will be valuable with regard to alice will provide alice with a goaloriented reason to maintain or promote e only if it stand in a certain necessary indexical relation to alice eg the relation of be the fulfillment of her preference be her pleasure be a realization of her potential or be the continuation of her life
since value arise and exist within such relation of particular agent with specific end it be the agent within that relation for whom those end be valuable for whom those end provide goaloriented reason of value for action
hence from e be be valuable with regard to alice from e it do not follow in the least that e be valuable as such ie be agentneutrally valuable or that in virtue of such agentneutral value alan have any reason to maintain or promote e or even to abstain from destroy it
any e be be of value for alice in itself provide no reason at least no reason of a goaldirected sort for alan to maintain or promote or even not to destroy e of course in special circumstance there may be some overlap in the end including the most basic end that be of value to alice and alan
they may each take nonrivalrous pleasure in the local band s performance of sousa march and have reason even cooperatively to promote these events but within any largescale pluralist society the special sharing of goal that exist among particular individual and group will not even begin to provide the basis for goalbased rule or prescription have general interpersonal force across that society
on the contrary the agentrelativity of value which people owe allegiance and in the name of which the behavior of individual may legitimately be bend mold or constrain
for any notion of the social good which be not merely a appeal to fantastic organicism must be construct by aggregate combine rank or otherwise depersonalize the separate and variegated good of particular individual
but no such combinatory process make sense among the incommensurable agentrelative value of individual
the cost impose on alice to advance a human good realize in the life of alan be not furthermore a cost that advance some agentneutral goal such as the maximization of aggregate utility or the greatest possible enhancement of the less well endow social position for which alice as a rational or moral agent should be prepare to pay
the denial of morally authoritative common goal which each person as a rational or moral agent have reason to promote free individual from the threat of the justified subordination of their life and capacity to the promotion of such conception of the good
unfortunately from all moral constraint on their behavior towards others in the course of their respective pursuit of personal end
i argue however that this be mere appearance
for there be another connect facet of moral individualism
to affirm the agentrelativity of value be to acknowledge each person as have ultimate end of his own as possess distinctive end for his person to which he rationally ought to devote the element which compose his personal constitution
but to acknowledge such distinctive end for each person be to remove each person from the realm of mere thing that have no rational purpose of their own and that be therefore morally available for exploitation by other purposive being
as a endinhimself in the sense of possess his own distinctive and separate lifepurposes each agent be also a endinhimself in the sense of not be a mean to the purpose of others
the recognition of others as reasonbearing and valuepursuing being on a moral par with oneself do not then require allegiance to their good nor somehow to be construct out of everyone s incommensurable value
the rational recognition of others take instead the form of deontic constraint on one s liberty to use others
respect for sideconstraints on one s permissible treatment of others be the way in which in one s practical relation to others one can recognize the value and importance of their project and end without incorporate them into one s own plan of life or factor them along with all others project and end into some unified and common end morally speak to be a selfowner be to possess moral authority over one s personal constitution ie over those feature component or aspect of one s personal existence the rational goal of which be the advancement of one s lifedefining purpose
the component of one s personal constitution which one have reason to devote to one s good define the moral domain over which one have natural jurisdiction
thus the practical recognition of others as moral equal with oneself with separate end of their of each as a selfowner as a being with a special moral jurisdiction over the person he be
this be the initial key claim of moral individualism s theory of the right
alice can never provide other agent at large with reason to respect her possession and control of any extrapersonal object by point out that this respect be conducive to her good ie that she have reason to want that possession respect
the value for her of that possession may be real however it fail to command the compliance of others
on the other hand be she credibly able to invoke a authoritative common end which be serve by her possession then respect for her possession would indeed be imperative
but no such invocation be credible
as thing stand then if alice have a claim to some extrapersonal object which be good against the world it can not be in virtue of either the agentrelative or the agentneutral value of her possession of it
rather her claim must take the form with her peaceful enjoyment of that object
and this right if there be such a right must represent a portion of the recognition all other agent owe her as a separate reasonbearing and valuepursuing be on a moral par with themselves

rightsbased classical liberalism
the core of classical liberalism be the assertion of selfownership or some kindred right protective of the individual in his life and liberty along with the idea that this right codify at least part of the constraint on behavior that each individual may demand of others in recognition of his status as a moral endinhimself
moreover the motivation that champion robust individual right in person also seem to support a comparable division of the extrapersonal world into discrete domain each of which will lie but not inalienably within the moral jurisdiction of some particular person or perhaps some particular coalition of person
for such a division allow extrapersonal material to be secure to serve the purpose of individual agent in the same fashion as the ascription to each of a his natural endowment in the service of his end
certainly both of the philosophical giant of a natural right classical liberalism ie locke and kant be firm advocate of rightsbased immunity against seizure and interference with regard to both the individual person and his property
in the case of locke of course private property right be ground in in virtue of arise through the exercise of each person s right to his own labor which itself be a aspect of each individual s selfpropriety in kant the right over one s own person and to private property have a common grounding in a right to equal freedom 
of course the sovereignty of each over himself secure for individual inventory of personal resource that may be highly unequal
joe s geneticallybased bulge biceps may radically outclass wilbur s tiny triceps while joan s native intense intelligence may comparably outdistance wilma s wandering wit
the morally protect natural endowment of each need not jointly satisfy any privileged pattern or ratio
similarly for the seem natural and inoffensive that the division of extrapersonal material among person also need not satisfy any sanctified pattern or ratio we should though guard against the assumption that there will be any systematic correspondence between proportionate share of personal endowment and of extrapersonal endowment
or if there turn out to be a systematic correspondence it may be only because what retrospectively count as valuable share of personal endowment be precisely those endowment which turn out to facilitate the attainment of extrapersonal resource
just as the formal equality of selfownership may be satisfy without each selfowner possess a personal endowment sufficient even minimally to advance his purpose so too the envisioned division of the world of extrapersonal material need not guarantee each individual material sufficient even minimally to enhance his life 
thus fightsbased classical liberalism have the following defining feature
 it be rightsbased ie the fundamental legally enforceable constraint be those demand by individual right and these right themselves represent a interpersonal recognition of the separate moral importance of found upon any sort of transindividual overall social value
 it endorse a doctrine of moral selfownershipof each person s moral jurisdiction over himself or some functionally equivalent or near equivalent right such as a right against interference with one s person
 it take all particular right to extrapersonal object to arise through the performance of specific entitlementconferring action
it may be maintain that the entitlementconferring action be simply exercise of selfownership or its functional equivalent or some aspect of selfownership or its functional equivalent
or alternatively it may be maintain that the entitlementconferring activity be those action that confer title within a practice of private property to which each individual have a right
this correspond to the division between act theory and the practice theory
""
 as follow from and be presuppose by classical liberalism take the world of natural extrapersonal object to be initially morally up for grab ie to be itself thoroughly naturally unowned such fall within the respective moral domain of the person whose component and power they be no element of the natural world be as such morally attach to any individual
those moral attachment be instead produce by specific entitlementconferring action
 in virtue of its endorsement of selfownership classical liberalism operate with a strong presumption against any doctrine that assert or imply that some people have natural right to the product of other people s effort and endeavor
for it take such a right to the product and hence the effort and endeavor of others to clash fundamentally with selfownership

selfownership and act theory of private property
in the course of characterize feature of classical liberalism i have cite two alternative conception of the basis of private entitlement in extrapersonal object
according to one these entitlement arise simply through various exercise of selfownership while according to the other conception these entitlement arise through action in accordance with the rule and procedure define a practice of companion to the natural right of person over themselves
one might then proceed in terms of a distinction between the selfownership exercise theory and the selfownership companion theory
but put matter in these term would not do much to capture and convey the difference between the structure of the two strategy and the rationale for the latter strategy
it will in the end be better to have advance more slowly to the act versus practice characterization of these alternative
i turn therefore to a account of act theory of entitlement to extrapersonal holding
there be two main reason for provide this material
one reason be to get some sense of what truth there be to be glean from act theory for incorporation into any justifiable practice of private property
the second reason be to begin to build the case for go beyond act theory to the practice theory which assert that there must be within classical liberalism a distinct natural right of property which supplement selfownership
act theory of entitlement to extrapersonal object seek to account for or some set of exercise of selfownership or some functionally equivalent primary right or the exercise of some aspect of selfownership
each present rightholder exercise his selfownership in a certain way and this exercise extend his moral jurisdiction over some extrapersonal object
the agent s moral jurisdiction be extend by his action because his action extend the agent s vulnerability to the violation of his selfownership
each such entitlement be subject to a separate and selfcontained vindication
do the putative rightholder exercise his selfownership by transform create initiate the use of etc this extrapersonal object do the putative rightholder s action thereby extend his moral jurisdiction to the actedupon object if the answer be affirmative interference with or seizure of the object have the quality of violate the agent s selfownership and in virtue of this the agent be entitle to the object
the paradigmatic version of the act approach be the lockean labor theory of property or more specifically the lockean labor theory of just initial acquisition with respect to extrapersonal property be ascribe to all person
in the lockean case of course it be the right of each to his own labor which itself be a implication of each person s selfpropriety
this internal right provide or be supposed to provide a conduit for individual right to enter the external world
in the lockean paradigm a individual may exercise his right over his own labor and thereby mix his labor with extrapersonal material
since the labor be invest and not merely dissipate the resulting transformed object now contain something the agent s labor which be still morally attach to the agent
for others now to seize this object would be for them to seize the labor that have be mix with it
since seize the agent s labor would violate his general right to his own labor seize the transformed object now violate the laborer s right
thus original right to such transformed segment of the extrapersonal world be externalization of person basic internal right
the numerous candidate for this sort of bridgebuilding between internal right and the extrapersonal world
another prominent candidate be the right to liberty construe as a right against interference in the disposition of one s body talent energy and so on
under this alternative the crucial bridging act would not be the mixing of one s labor but rather the deployment of one s liberty through the use of extrapersonal object so that one s liberty be now hostage to others nonseizure of those objects the crucial bridging claim would be that the seizure of a object which one be use in ongoing purposive activity constitute a violation of one s right to liberty
much less be say by act theorist about nonoriginal private property right ie about right arise through or be convey by voluntary transfer
the characteristic theme of act theory be perhaps most fully retain in conception of legitimate transfer in which the prior owner in effect vacate ownership while at the same time the new owner s acquisition constitute a new be establish
thus the prior owner paul vacate perhaps to begin with in a way that allow only his chosen successor sally to commence her rightsestablishing act permissibly while sally by her investment of her labor or by the incorporation of the object in her ongoing purposive activity bring about a new externalization of the internal right to her own labor or the internal right against interference with her person and activity
right as such be never transfer nor do the prior owner s transfer of the holding to his successor as such bestow a right upon the latter which be a moral descendant of the original right
rather the prior owner paul s function be merely to restore his holding to the state of nature albeit to restore it selectively so that third party remain morally constrain not to appropriate the object before successor sally establish a new original right to it
any such reenactment conception of just transfer in effect close the gap between principle of initial acquisition and of transfer since essentially the same sort own object
any particular reenactment principle of just transfer will of course be no more plausible than the corresponding principle of initial acquisition
but give eg the labor or liberty principle of initial acquisition the cognate reeenactment principle be not terribly farfetched at least for transfer that be exchange
in the case of a labor reeenactment doctrine the claim will be that the labor present in the service or invest in the object that sally offer for the purpose of exchange combine with the labor sally invest in arrange or participate in the exchange be the labor permissibly invest by her in her newly acquire hold
exchange transmit investment from the object surrender to the object thereby purchase
in the case of a liberty reenactment doctrine the claim will simply be that a exchange constitute a permissible substitution of object in use in ongoing project and that the project itself may be the achievement of advantageous ie valueenhancing substitution
have permissibly and purposively acquire the object from paul it the service of sally s plan
in contrast reenactment principle must handle gift transfer somewhat less well
for gift transfer by their nature require less action on the part of the recipient
still perhaps what little any recipient must do to acknowledge receipt of a gift can be construe as a minimal permissible reenactment of the property generating act
furthermore surely something can be say about the giftgiver s moral power to convey to or otherwise establish in the recipient of his gift a entitlement to that object
and presumably whatever can be say will also apply to the seller s moral power to convey title
suppose that paul already have title to object o and be willing to convey o to sally so as to establish both her possession and title to o it seem that this must make it easy for sally to acquire title to o or must provide sally with a different way of acquire title to o than if paul do not have title of o and be could toward her acquisition of unowned o a major point in have a right over a object be to have a determinate say not only in how one will use that object but also about who if anyone shall succeed one in have that determinate say
what remain puzzling however be precisely how that moral power nifty as it may be to the rightholder arise out of the act by which property in a given object be established 
the core contention of act theorist be that through certain purposive and effective interaction with the extrapersonal world agent can project into the object of those interaction the personal moral inviolability which otherwise seem to extend only to the outer surface of their body
if one be willing to acknowledge the personal inviolability express in the idea of selfownership one must call forth a very determined normative skepticism to doubt the basic plausibility of this core contention
the lockean doctrine that initial right over previously unowned segment of nature arise through the mixing of labor with that segment of nature of literal physical mixing of one stuff with another by formulate it in terms of a person s investment of his talent time and energy his human capital in the now transform object
and once it be it be eminently plausible to maintain that the person who seize the transformed material expropriate the human capital of the investor and thereby engage in a action on a moral par with the direct seizure involved in forced labor
he who seize the transformed object simply cunningly wait until after the transformation occur and thereby evade the danger and difficulty of direct confrontation with and control of the productive party
it be essentially this lockean argument which be recast by nozick when he argue that
seize the result of someone s labor be equivalent to seizing hour from him and direct him to carry on various activity
if people force you to do certain work or unrewarded work for a certain period of time they decide what you be to do and what purpose your work be to serve apart from from you make them a partowner of you it give them a property right in you
just as have such partial control and power of decision by right over a animal or inanimate object would be to have a property right in it 
the argument from liberty be likewise plausible at its core
whereas the labor argument look backward to the investment of self in the extrapersonal world the liberty argument look forward to the projection of self into the world
people obviously do not live by past investment alone but also by necessarily prospective interaction with extrapersonal object interaction which when view from some later point may count as a investment of self
these projection of self have particular trajectory which be at least in part define by the extrapersonal object put to use and through the use of which the agent project the completion of his course
since everyone s existence as a reasonbearing and valueseeking being have this projective dimension a right to liberty from interference with one s person with or seizure of the object which already have be permissibly incorporate into one s ongoing course of action
as long as use within a projected and ongoing activity be construe cautiously and narrowly as with the use that a hunter have for his bow even at the moment when it lie by his side or the use that the philosopher have for his word processor even when he be busy cooking dinner it be reasonable to say that to disrupt such use through interference or seizure of the agent s instrument be to interfere with the liberty of his person if the agent have a right to that liberty then through his permissible initiation of that ongoing use he acquire a entitlement to the extrapersonal object therein put to use
finally especially insofar as transfer can be press into the reenactment mold the consideration that act theorist bring forward also support particular holding acquire through voluntary transfer from their previous rightful owner
""
internal right and the limit of act theory take either singly or in complementary union part of the problem be that act theory provide us with diverse but only scattered exemplar of entitlement to extrapersonal object
we can identify a particular instance in which paul have so act as to extend the moral boundary originally encompass only his person to enclose this carefully crafted bow and another instance in which sally have so act as to extend the moral boundary originally encompass only her person to enclose this carefully tend field
what act theory can provide us with be certain particularly vivid instance of property right instance which have vivacity because these entitlement stand on their own
they need not draw their moral force from their place within any large normative system
each of these isolated paradigm of entitlement be selfsufficient in the sense that each contain its own justification or more precisely its justification be contain within the particular history of that holding
to see those particular historical fact in the light of selfownership be to see the wrongfulness of deprive the possessor of his holding the private holding among those that would strike almost any ideologically untainted observer as perfectly legitimate will satisfy this standard of vivid selfsufficing justification
most of us be fortunate enough to live in society which at least minimally recognize the legitimacy of individual pursuit of their own value and connectedly recognize individual right in a considerable range of extrapersonal object
any such person live in a world densely populate with legitimate entitlement
the validity of these entitlement be not conditional upon each link in their history be a selfsufficient exemplar of entitlement generation or transfer
rather their legitimacy rest on their be the entitlement of peaceful and honest individual to the possession they have respectively acquire in accordance with their society be generally recognize and justifiable rule for the rightful acquisition of the type of object in question
for such rule to be justifiable and thereby to constitute formula for the generation of legitimate entitlement they must accommodate or better yet be analogical extension of the selfsufficing mode of property acquisition
they must of the agent s human capital or a selfsufficing put to use at least some conventional counterpart to such investment or put to use
instead or partially instead of mix one s labor throughout the area one intend to mine or put to use the vein of ore by bring to the location all the equipment which extraction will ultimately require one may engage in the conventional counterpart of file one s claim
it be these analogicalconventional extension which make possible most of the specific legitimate entitlement which merit recognition
in consider these claim we be already enter the territory of the practice theory
but here the point be to see the shortcoming of act theory
act theory themselves will not account for the host of entitlement which do not measure up to the selfsufficing exemplar they provide
and act theory do not themselves provide justification for go beyond these exemplar to the analogicalconventional extension which would account for those far entitlement
i have characterize act theory as seek to invoke a internal right in order to vindicate this strategy and hence can be view as a critic of act theory of private property a brief consideration of kant be generally enigmatic to me discussion reveal the essential validity of his critique
kant distinguished between empirical and external possession
a object be empirically mine if and only if i be the holder of that thing that is physically connect to it a object
""
""
be externally mine if and only if it be such that any prevention of my use of it would constitute a injury to me even if it be not in my possession that is i be not the holder of the object
 kant s argument be that a appeal to a internal right can at most support entitlement to empirical possession b at least some entitlement be to external possession indeed something be be externally mine be paradigmatic of entitlement hence never be adequate theory of entitlement
thus kant summarize the limitation of invoke any internal right
if i be the holder of a thing that is physically connect to it then anyone who touch it without my consent for example wrest a apple from my hand affect and diminish that which be internally mine my freedom
consequently the maxim of his action stand in direct contradiction to the axiom of justice right
thus the proposition concerning empirical possession do not extend beyond the right of the person with respect to himself 
if right to external object which be not continually empirically possess be to be sustain there must be a appeal to something other than the right of the person with respect to himself
there must be a appeal to intelligible possession which for kant be make possible by
""
""
""
the juridical postulate of practical reason it be a duty of justice to act toward also become someone s property
""
kant may be wrong in argue that appeal to a internal right will never get one beyond right to what be literally hold
that he be wrong about this be the thrust of my defense of act theory
but his more general claim accord with my insistence on the limitation of act theory
this be that in many if not most case a agent s entitlement to a external object can not be explain by show that the seizure of that object would diminish that which be internally his
for the seizure would not touch on what be internally his it would not trespass upon any right of the person with respect to himself
""
this limitation of internal right of selfownership or its functional equivalent ought on reflection to be no surprise
for selfownership itself at least as ordinarily explicate do not reflect or embody the crucial and necessary role of extrapersonal object in all person value pursuit
to see this helpful explication of selfownership
jeremy waldron nicely capture this notion as follow
to say that i own myself be to say that nobody but me have the fight to dispose of me or to direct my action
i have right to do these thing though i must not harm others in do so that is i must not exercise my selfownership in a way which violate theirs and those right be exclusive of anyone else s privilege in this regard for they be correlative to others duty to refrain from interfere with what in this sense i own 
selfownership be the polar opposite of moral slavery of be utterly under the moral authority of others
thus selfownership be also aptly explicate by contrast with such slavery
as g a cohen put it
the thought be that each person be the morally rightful owner of himself
he possess over himself as a matter of right all those fight that a slaveholder have over a complete chattel slave as morally speak to dispose over himself in the way such a slaveholder be entitle legally speak to dispose over his slave
such a slaveholder may not direct his slave to harm other people but he be not legally obligate to place him at their disposal to the slight degree he owe none of his slave s service to anyone else
so analogously if i be the moral owner of myself and therefore of this right arm then while others be entitle in virtue of their selfownership to prevent it from hit people no one be entitle without my consent to press it into their own or anybody else s service 
notice however that both waldron s and cohen s explication of selfownership and perhaps my own brief explication at the outset of this essay be entirely consistent with human being require nothing for the feasible pursuit of their value other than material that be internal to human being ie to some human being or other
the part faculty talent etc and bind not without their consent to make use of the like element of others personal constitution even if the use of others internal resource would advance the first selfowner s plan of life
the personal endowment of each warrant protection because they be of potential use to both their natural possessor and others
the right of each over his own person seem then to take no cognizance of the equal indispensability of extrapersonal object in human goaldirected action this explain the incapacity of act theory with their focus on entitlement generation solely through the exercise of some internal right to provide more than exemplar of right to extrapersonal object
""
the natural right to the practice of private property
the human condition with regard to the role of extrapersonal resource in the pursuit of value be radically different from what could be infer merely from such a right of person over themselves
for besides be physical being literally occupy physical space human being extend beyond the space occupy by their respective body
this extended world be the field in which almost all human value be pursue and purpose be achieve
it be the field in which each of us encounter and interact with others
and within that field human goal be advance through the employment of individual ability insight and energy on the material object of the world both the raw material and that material as it have be mold and transform by past human purposiveness and inadvertence
human life understand as ongoing purposive selfsustaining and selfenhancing activity take place mostly outside of human body in and through the world of extrapersonal object
nor be the activity in which human life consist merely a matter of recurrent excursion or raid into the world of extrapersonal object
extrapersonal object enter into and help define the specific goal ambition and commitment through which individual compose their respective life
particular extrapersonal object become deeply incorporate into the specific strategy that individual formulate for their may be merely contingently connect with the pure concept of goaloriented activity
but it be surely necessarily connect with human life and the human pursuit of end
and emphatically this be true of all or nearly all human end not just those that might be mark off or denigrate as economic
the life of the religious crusader the political pamphleteer the athlete the aesthete the pornographer the family man and woman the tourist the gourmet and the gourmand all require extrapersonal vehicle and avenue
this necessary feature of human life strongly suggest that selfownership at least as so far explicate by waldron cohen and myself can not represent the entirety the single sturdy trunk of person fundamental and noncontractual right
it make it plausible that any story that be tell about the fundamental right of individual which do not find significant implication in this necessary feature of human life must be a incomplete story demand supplementation that supplementation may take the form the addition of another equally fundamental right correspond to the practical recognition of other human being as endsinthemselves who necessarily live their life in and through the extrapersonal world
since nothing be gain and clarity be lose by insist that all fundamental natural right must be part of selfownership i will take the strongly suggest need for supplementation to point to another equally fundamental right a companion to natural selfownership namely a natural right of property 
but must not any clearthinking advocate of classical liberalism reject anything which be strictly speak a natural right of property for it would seem that a natural right of or at least to property must assert that each person be born to entitlement in extrapersonal object just as he be born to a moral jurisdiction over himself
moreover a natural right to extrapersonal product of human effort and endeavor would clash with component of classical liberalism as well as and 
and even if such a right be restrict to and 
what then could a natural fight of property in conformity with classical liberalism be
that right could be a right to the practice of private property
the right to the practice of private property be a natural right with regard to extrapersonal object
nevertheless it be not itself a entitlement to any particular extrapersonal object or any share of any such object
thus endorsement of this natural right be consistent with the classical liberal view that all right to extrapersonal object arise through the performance of entitlementconferring action
the significance of the right to the practice of private property be that action which be entitlementconferring at least in part enjoy this moral power in virtue of their conformity to the rule constitutive of that practice
it be this natural right to the practice of private property which i shall argue be part of the practical recognition rationally require by each person s possession of a human life with a independent rational purpose of its own
there and practice theory of property right on the more familiar distinction between act and ruleutilitarianism
in choose the actpractice terminology i have succumb to this temptation
but it be necessary to clarify precisely how the present distinction draw upon the more commonplace one and how this temptation may lead one down misguided path
actutilitarianism be of course characterize by its direct application of the utilitarian conception of the good to the ranking of alternative available action
each action s rank depend directly on the agentneutral value of the world occasion by its performance the available action that most promote the agentneutral good be the high rank and hence the obligatory one
in contrast rule utilitarianism apply the utilitarian conception of the good to the ranking of alternative set of rule or practice
one set of rule be rank high than another if and only if compliance with the former more promote the agentneutral good than compliance with the latter
a particular action be right or even obligatory if and only a right action need not then itself have the power of more promote the agentneutral good than all other available particular action
indeed a action have in itself this power may nevertheless be wrong in virtue of its violation of some rule within the optimizing set of rules 
in adopt the actpractice terminology i intend to draw upon the familiarity of the contrast between i defend a particular act or hold by display the particulars s embodiment of the justifying quality and ii defend the particular act or hold by show its compliance with a rule or practice which itself be the direct object of moral justification
but three divergence from the act versus rule utilitarian distinction must be note
the first and relatively minor one be that act and practice theory of property right aim at the vindication of assertion of right while act and ruleutilitarianism typically seek to establish claim about the valueenhancing rightness of action
the second and more important divergence be between the theory of entitlement in extrapersonal object
within the former the point be to shift the utilitarian justification from the level of act upward to the level of rule
a central motivation for this shift be to render judgment about particular act less directly subject to any utilitarian calculus and thereby to provide these local judgment with a great deontic coloration
but the other side of this motivation be the desire of the ruleutilitarian to retain the fundamentally consequentialist appeal of his moral theory
in contrast the practice theory of property right be not at all motivate by a interest in make or reserving room at the commanding height of the theory for consequentialist reasoning
instead the practice in terms of which particular holding be to be vindicate be itself supposed to be the object of person natural moral right the legitimacy of particular holding be ultimately ground upon a deontic appeal to that right and to the normatively significant feature of individual life and value that underlie that right the third and perhaps most important divergence be that level of entitlementconferring rule the same justifying aim as the act theory employ on the level of particular holding
the practice theory do not seek to justify some set of entitlementconferring rule by show that this set of rule more protect or promote the exercise of selfownership than any other set of comparable rules the practice theory invoke a different right from that of selfproprietorship namely the natural right to the practice of private property or somewhat more precisely the natural right to others compliance with a system under which each agent can secure for himself the same sort of protected control over portion of the extrapersonal world as selfownership provide for each agent over his own person
any such system must exhibit certain feature
there must be rule specify entitlementconferring action
certain form of activity must count as establish title to previously unowned object other form of activity must count as dissolving existing title or as acquire title to object previously within the jurisdiction of others
but not every set of rule identify entitlementconferring procedure will be coherent the specification of entitlementconferring action must be such that noncompossible entitlement do not arise so that compliance with the resulting entitlement will always be possible
to be functional rule of the practice must be readily knowable to those govern by the practice sanction identifiable and predictable entitlement so that compliance with the confer entitlement be feasible to be comprehensive the rule of the practice must sanction or be subject to reasonable analogical extension so as to sanction the acquisition of entitlement to all previously unowned object
to be justifiable the practice must be compatible with selfownership
a justifiable system s entitlementconferring rule must in particular incorporate the plausible claim of act theory of private property to the effect that by means of certain exercise of one s selfownership one expose oneself to have that right violate by means of others interference with or seizure of one s external holding and one thereby acquire entitlement to those holding as extension of one s selfownership
let us say that a practice be fully comprehensive and justifiable
still in the abstract many different practice may qualify as fully justifiable relative to any given society in the abstract the right to the practice of private property be a right to people s compliance with some one of these fully justifiable practice
be any one of these alternative practice magically introduce at let us imagine a equally fanciful moment of mass entitlement amnesia in which all memory of who have entitlement to what under which specific rule be lose each person s right to the practice of private property would consist in his right to people s compliance with that introduced practice
compliance with that practice would be what each could reasonably expect of others in the way of respect for his natural right of property
have be introduce that practice would be the fully justify one
thus even at this level justice be historical one would not be justify in substitute any other practice which be equally justifiable in the abstract for the now establish and coherence or functionality of the effective system of property right for that society if apply retroactively it would nullify entitlement confer under a existing justifiable practice
even a existing practice which be not in the abstract fully justifiable can be justify and thereby will be resistant to be justifiably replace by a fully justifiable practice
it will be justify if it be roughly speak about as abstractly justifiable as can reasonably be expect in actual human affair
the case against substitution of alternative practice which undercut a system s coherence and functionality do not of course rule out reform and beneficial evolution with a society s justified law of property
such change aim at or at least result in the enhancement of the coherence functionality comprehensiveness or justifiability of the existing practice be to be guide or evaluate in terms of the organizing idea of the private property system ie the idea of sanction the expansion of personal sphere of authority so as to secure for individual inviolability of a justified practice of private property individual do acquire title to extrapersonal object by engage in the specified entitlementconferring action
although the specification of entitlementconferring action must embody the truth that may be glean from act theory of entitlement some entitlementconferring act under a given justified practice will not involve the sort of extension of selfownership which be the focus of act theory
those act nevertheless confer entitlement in virtue of their conformity to the entitlementgenerating rule of a justified practice
in addition although i be not sure what weight to give this factor the expectation with regard to protected holding that be generate under a existing justified system be legitimate expectation
as legitimate expectation they provide individual with reasonable claim against those who be bind to comply with that practice
when that compliance occur the entitlement generate by the action specify by a practice s rule and correspond to the agent legitimate expectation and sometimes far support by act theory consideration be respected 
the particular constraint with which individual have in fact come into operation in the society and which actual entitlementconferring action individual have in fact perform
justice in extrapersonal holding be as nozick maintain in anarchy state and utopia historical and unpatterned
the justice of any particular holding be a matter of that hold actually arise through certain specific procedure namely those that confer entitlement within the existing justified practice
a set of holding among people ie a distribution of holding be just insofar as the particular holding be independently historically legitimate
the justice of the whole follow from the justice of the part not the other way around
thus no characteristic of the whole can be the touchstone of the justice of the whole or of its constituent part
the justice of the whole distribution will depend neither on its presentation of a certain profile eg equality among holding or the maximization of the small packet of holding nor on the individual holding within that distribution map some other characteristic of the property holder absence of any preordained pattern to which the distribution of extrapersonal material must conform parallel the absence of any such regulative pattern for the distribution of personal endowment as be anticipted in the first paragraph of section ii
each individual s status as a moral endinhimself with a life of his own to lead i have maintain require that his person not be subject to assault invasion or seizure
this status require that he not be treat as a mean morally available for the purpose of others
this be to say that the element of each person s constitution his body faculty talent and energy must be acknowledge as uniquely his mean for the pursuit of his valued end acknowledge as within his distinct moral domain
each individual s status as a moral endinhimself with a human life to lead in and through the world of extrapersonal object require that others rational recognition of them must extend into that external world
that recognition translate for worldinteractive
human being into
since people live their life in and through the external world necessarily deeply incorporate into their plan particular external object and contour their life through attachment to them any recognition of them as moral endsinthemselves who be owe immmunity in their peaceful ie immunityrespecting pursuit of value must recognize and respect their incorporation and attachment
the status of person as endsinthemselves require then that the use acquisition stock transformation incorporation and deployment of those extrapersonal object in and through which human individual create and advance their life not be subject to assault invasion or disruption
it demand that these mode of use and interaction with extrapersonal object mode of interaction and use in which individual enjoy exclusive discretionary and stable albeit alienble control possess a moral immunity in the form of moral constraint on the action of others comparable to the constraint against attack upon the person himself
the very project through which human being constitute themselves as person and achieve value in their life necessarily involve instance but over lifetime
thus there be a hegelian dimension to the case for a natural right of property a dimension which emphasize that human life be not live within our body but rather be enact through purposive interaction with the world in a world of finite extrapersonal resource it be only under the auspice of such a system of immunity that person can be free of assault upon their worldengaging and selfdefining project and thus upon the very core of their separate life
respect for the entitlement confer by a justified practice of private property be respect for separate project pursuer as being whose life be necessarily engage in and contoured to and by the extrapersonal world

introduction
in his book moral by agreement david gauthier offer a stateofnature justification for a form of ownership which he believe closely resemble private ownership gauthier argue that first appropriation of land within certain restriction morally justify vest in the appropriator right resemble private ownership
gauthier be not alone in his use of a stateofnature justification of a form of ownership
locke rousseau kant and recently robert nozick have also offer stateofnature justification
i have already show how these other attempt at justification fail but because gauthier s attempt be far more subtle and complex his argument require me to do more than simply refer to what i have early say
i have argue that all stateofnature justification by first appropriation must fail because they presuppose unrealistic condition and be questionbegging
i shall prove that gauthier s stateofnature justification be no exception
i shall limit this discussion of gauthier s justification to his treatment of ownership of land and resource
gauthier s argument concerning do not depend upon a stateofnature appropriation and many of his conclusion about ownership of self and labor run parallel to conclusion i have reach
it be primarily gauthier s reliance upon a stateofnature firstappropriation justification of ownership which cause his argument to fail
the failure be methodological it do not depend upon substantive morality
his faulty methodology can not give determinate conclusive result
in the next section i shall show that gauthier s justification be questionbegging because he fail to establish that private ownership and only private ownership be derivable from stateofnature condition
i shall demonstrate in the third section that gauthier s justification of the form he believe resemble private ownership appear plausible only because it presuppose unrealistic abundance in the state of nature which thus make unnecessary any form of ownership at all in the final section i shall contrast gauthier s form of ownership with private ownership and show that the way in which gauthier s form of ownership differ from private ownership make his form of ownership impossible to put into practice
any moral justification of a form of ownership ground upon a original act of appropriation in a state of nature must show not only that the particular form be thus ground but also that no other form can be so ground
use private ownership as a example it be not sufficient to show that private ownership can be ground on original appropriation in a state of nature the argument must also show that no other form of ownership such as communal ownership can also fulfill the relevant standard of justification
let me explain more fully what i mean because this point be almost universally ignore
suppose that a gauthier or a locke try to prove that private ownership base upon original private appropriation produce more utility or benefit to each individual than the state of nature in which land and resource in effect constitute a commons available to all
while this argument may seem to justify private ownership the argument do not show that only private ownership be morally justify
there may be other form of ownership also produce more utility or benefit than a state of nature in which land and resource be a commons available to all
if the standard of justification be the production of great benefit or utility for each than the stateofnature commons then private ownership private usufruct and collective cooperative ownership may be morally justify
the problem be that this stateofnature justification show all three to be justify which mean that this stateofnature argument can not be use to decide which of the three be morally preferable
a complete justification would have to show that private ownership and only private ownership fulfill the standard of justification
other form of ownership must therefore be examine and show not to fulfill the standard
argument which show that private ownership or any other form be ground upon original appropriation but which fail to show that only private ownership or some other form be so ground i shall call partial justification
this distinction between partial and complete justification be different from and independent of the distinction between what be justification of ownership might conclude that one specific form and only one specific form of ownership be morally justify and thus morally require
by contrast moral justification of ownership might conclude that several closely related form of ownership be all morally permissible and that no one of them be morally require
adopt any one of the closely related form would be right
to be closely relate in this sense imply that these form of ownership be constitute by certain right of title such as the right to income or the right to manage or certain criteria of title such as bequest which be morally optional this be to say that either vest the right or withhold the right must be morally permissible
form of ownership would not be closely relate in this sense if vest the right be morally permissible and withhold it be not
just as a justification of a morally required form of ownership can be either complete or partial so also can a justification of morally permissible form of ownership be either complete or of closely related form of ownership be justifiable so that any form within the range be morally permissible
a complete justification of ownership would have to argue that these closely related form and only these closely related form fulfill the justificatory requirement
if the argument demonstrate that the closely related form fulfill the justificatory requirement without also demonstrate that other unrelated form fail to fulfill the requirement then the justification be only partial
any argument which ground a specific form of ownership upon some justificatory requirement without explain why other form can not be similarly ground fail to provide a complete justification and may also fail to provide reason for judge whether the form of ownership be morally permissible or morally require
gauthier as well as locke kant and nozick offer only a partial justification of private ownership
not only do gauthier never consider the possibility that other form of ownership might have the same result as private ownership but indeed there be other form of ownership which do have the same result
that be integral to his method as he see it
gauthier consider morality to be the product of agreement for cooperative interaction which be require to remedy the essential imperfection of the free market both the free market as a morally free zone and cooperative agreement to internalize external cost presuppose a impartial but not equal initial bargaining position of factor endowments this be to say that market presuppose people own something to exchange in the market and that bargaining presuppose that people start at some position of strength or weakness from which they may assess the value of various possible agreement
gauthier argue that in order for the output from the free market and from agreement to be moralize the input ie the initial position must be prove to be impartial
gauthier reject a equal initial position such as john rawls s because it permit free riders original impartial private appropriation be the necessary moral foundation which gauthier believe he need in order to moralize the output of the reason integral to gauthier s theory it must be notice that in general gift bequest and exchange be incomplete as criteria of title
each presuppose some additional criteria of title which would originally distribute legitimate title over thing so that individual could then transfer title by gift bequest or exchange
social contract theorist have solve the problem of original distribution in two different way
some have make the distribution prior to the contract while others have make the distribution part of the contract
rawls and hobbes make the distribution a result of the social contract
in the leviathan hobbes s contract empower the sovereign to make original distribution as well as to make the rule govern subsequent transfers rawls make the communal ownership of talent and ability part of the contract
by contrast hume and locke locate the original distribution in what exist prior to the convention or contract
for hume present possession at the time of the convention be the natural expedient for make the original labor on what be unowned as the criteria for his initial distribution
gauthier like hume and locke adopt the precontract rather than the contractdependent methodology
gauthier s justification of private ownership rest upon the following illustration
imagine that several person inhabit a island where the land and resource in effect constitute a commons available to all
use be in dividual each family provide primarily for its own need and interaction be noncooperative
suppose that eve the head of one of the family be aware that plan intensive cultivation would make the land more productive so that she propose to take a certain area of the island for her exclusive use in order that her family may benefit by maximize its productivity
she seek therefore a exclusive right to a certain portion of the island
eve seek the security of tenure which market compensation rather than full compensation confer
full compensation according to gauthier be compensation which leave a person without any net loss in utility
might realize through exchange
eve seek the more comprehensive protection which a right in the product of her labor would realize eve intend to better her family s situation through a system of right that determine her endowment for prospective market and cooperative interaction
gauthier argue that eve s appropriation need not be bring about by worsen the situation of the other islander
while eve might seek to appropriate a toolarge portion of the island which would violate the lockean proviso against worsen the situation of others there might be sufficiently abundant land such that she need not worsen the situation of others
eve s appropriation might be small enough and her increased productivity might be sufficiently large so that her fellow islander might be better off through exchange with her than they be before she privately appropriate her plot of land
gauthier conclude his derivation by show that if eve give up her right to the remaining commons and if eve s increased productivity would be beneficial to her as well as to others then her exclusive right of possession be in gauthier s word the great benefactress of human kind
""
i shall not at this point contest gauthier s conclusion that eve s appropriation can be beneficial both to herself and the other islander
in this section i shall assume that gauthier be right about eve s appropriation be beneficial
my problem with gauthier s method be that he give only a partial justification of possible form of appropriation in the state of nature
gauthier never consider other form of ownership in addition to private ownership that might be beneficial in much the same way as private ownership
the benefit of eve s private appropriation arise because intensive agriculture may produce great quantity of food per acre than unimproved land
vest in eve the right to use the land and the right to what she produce be necessary in order for eve rationally to undertake the labor of farming
as hobbes wisely maintain long ago agriculture as well as industry be not rational unless one can count upon the rightful possession of what if agriculture or industry be to be rationally undertake
while it be certainly true that private ownership vest in appropriator the right rationally need for such a undertaking it be just as certainly true that other possible form of ownership vest in appropriator right which satisfy the same rational necessity
gauthier s justification be only a partial justification because he do not consider form other than private ownership
suppose instead of eve s private appropriation that a group of person karl friedrich and rosa agree to collectively appropriate land for the purpose of intensive cultivation they agree to share evenly both the work of farming and the product produce
with their increased productivity karl friedrich and rosa could exchange their product with the other islander as do eve
this form of collective ownership have the same economic consequence in the state of nature as do eve s private appropriation
thus if eve s appropriation be morally justifiable then so be the collective appropriation by karl friedrich and s term sufficiently compensate any losers 
such collective ownership in itself might be a morally compatible alternative to eve s private appropriation which could be practice along with private ownership without any moral incoherence
but collective ownership could far evolve by stage consistent with gauthier s justification into a form of ownership which be morally very different from private ownership
this collective ownership by karl friedrich and rosa could evolve within the confine establish by gauthier into a islandwide social ownership
imagine that the other islander see the success achieve by karl friedrich and rosa so that they too desire to join the collective
so instead of exchange what they produce with the collective the other islander judge themselves better off by join the collective as coworker
since the land collectively farm could be expand or the number of product could be multiply karl friedrich and rosa could judge themselves better off as well
all islander might see the advantage of social ownership and management of the island
they could agree to social selfmanagement and ownership of the land and resource on the island 
neither the collective ownership by karl friedrich and rosa nor the social ownership by all the islander need be equivalent to private ownership in its variant form of joint or corporate ownership
such private ownership right as bequest exchange or alienation need not be include in the right which vest in the member of the collective
the form of ownership may not permit any right to alienate the land that be identify with the people who live on it
such be the case marx cite of primitive form of communism as well as with the concept of ownership hold by native american tribe
that karl rosa and friedrich agree to cooperate do not violate gauthier s assumption about human motivation
gauthier defend a subjective theory of value
a person be consider preference determine her reason for choice and action
even though gauthier s basic motivational assumption be the subjective theory of value he sometimes describe his or nontuistic
several commentator have note that gauthier s description be not equivalent a subjective theory of value do not logically limit a person s motivation only to choice that be selfinterested or nontuistic
someone may prefer to advance the interest of others eg the interest of friend and lovedones
selfinterest and nontuism of course limit the content of preference
gauthier have recently say that his selfinterest assumption be to prevent doublecounting in utility calculation such a practice would count some preference twice and thus upset pareto optimality gauthier s reply do not explain why the decision by karl rosa and friedrich to cooperate need violate his assumption whether it be describe as the subjective theory of value or as selfinterested
if karl rosa and friedrich prefer to cooperate then there be no incompatibility with a subjective theory of value
karl s rosa s and friedrich s choice to cooperate also need not violate either the assumption of selfinterest or of nontuism
cooperation can from cooperation
gauthier s argument in moral by agreement depend upon this
gauthier s decision to base the initial position upon a private appropriation be therefore one plausible choice but it be not the only logical or best one
private ownership and exchange be one way individual may benefit but it be not the only way
work together and share the increased productivity be another
cooperation be not incompatible with assumption about selfinterest or nontuism
nor can gauthier argue that cooperation between karl friedrich and rosa be exclude because it would be a contract before the social contract
first of all as i remark early social contract theorist have deal with the problem of initial distribution by both precontract and contractdependent methodology
nothing in the idea of a social contract necessitate a precontract methodology rather than a contractdependent one
second gauthier s own method must permit precontract agreement and cooperation both of which be presuppose by the free market which gauthier believe exist prior to and be the reason for moral by why gauthier s justification of private ownership be only a partial justification
he simply fail to discuss other form of ownership which could plausibly fit his justificatory schema
my example of collective ownership and social ownership could equally arise in gauthier s stateofnature circumstance
gauthier do not consider this possibility
i do not believe gauthier see his eve illustration as demonstrate that private ownership be only morally permissible and not morally require
gauthier say nothing that would even hint at this option
besides even if gauthier s intention be to prove only that private ownership be morally permissible his justification would still be partial because he have not demonstrate that some form and only some form of ownership be morally permissible
gauthier s attempt at justify private ownership from a original appropriation in the state of nature fail to produce a complete justification of private ownership which show that private ownership and only private ownership be morally justifiable
his justification be partial because his argument fail to exclude other possible form of ownership
gauthier be not unique in have carefully compare the implication of different form of ownership in state of nature condition
it be not a sufficient proof to establish merely that private ownership be a improvement upon the state of nature
a complete justification must actually show that no other possible form of ownership can do as well
""
ownership and scarcity
in this section i shall focus upon the issue of scarcity in the state of nature
specifically and contrary to gauthier s expressed argument i shall show that eve s private appropriation can only fulfill the condition of the proviso against worsen the condition of others in extremely unrealistic conditions i shall show that the condition in which eve s appropriation be unlikely to violate the proviso be exceptional rather than condition which be generally fulfil
thus gauthier s justification may be successful only in exceptional circumstance
moreover in such exceptional circumstance any form of ownership would be unnecessary
gauthier seem to be aware of the problem of define scarcity realistically since he correctly admit that not be fulfil in any actual circumstances locke s criteria that a act of appropriation must leave enough and as good for others to appropriate could only be fulfil if object of appropriation be to exist in such superabundance that no act of appropriation diminish the amount others may still appropriate
one of locke s own example aptly illuminate this point
locke ask who could complain be someone to take a large draught of water from a great river if enough water remain for everyone else to do the same gauthier realize that neither land nor resource actually exist in such superabundance
but gauthier do not seem to realize that be locke s criteria fulfil no form of ownership whatsoever would be necessary
hume be well aware of this when he argue that scarcity be a necessary prerequisite of have any form of ownership
it be only because good of the world be scarce that ownership rule be necessary be good as superabundant as the water in locke s river there would be no need to objection to gauthier s use of a state of nature justification differ from a objection raise by david braybrooke
braybrooke argue that gauthier s contract unlike locke s can not be apply in history because of its fantastic demand on information which no contracting party could meet braybrooke focus upon the empirical impossibility of ever fulfil the condition of the contract
my point be different in that it rest on a conceptual not a empirical difficulty
i shall not be concerned about whether gauthier s stateofnature condition ever historically exist
my objection be that if gauthier s stateofnature condition could be fulfil there would be no reason to have any form of ownership whatsoever
the historical question about whether or not the condition of gauthier s state of nature ever could be fulfil be not crucial
gauthier s premise that eve s appropriation not worsen the condition of others seem to acknowledge that land do not exist in superabundance
the implication seem to be that eve s appropriation could make others bad off so that in a fixed limited supply
gauthier s assumption of scarcity appear realistic enough to avoid the unrealistic abundance which hume believe make ownership unnecessary
but once gauthier s assumption be examine more closely it be not at all obvious that eve s appropriation will not violate the proviso unless land exist in a unrealistically abundant quantity
gauthier argue that even though eve s appropriation of land may worsen the condition of the other islander because they lose the use of eve s land eve s increased productivity will actually enable her to improve the condition of the others
gauthier s argument be similar to the kaldorhicks improvement condition where one state of affair be judge better than another if the winner be able to but need not actually compensate the losers gauthier believe that eve s great efficiency and productivity will enable her to compensate the loser so that no one be make bad off but gauthier do not present any specific argument to support his belief
such argument would have to demonstrate that eve can be sufficiently productive be therefore necessary to estimate eve s productivity and the other islander s loss
what be the benefit eve and her family receive gauthier claim she intend to benefit herself and her family by a more efficient and productive cultivation of her land
gauthier far assume that those benefit eve seek must derive from a increased quantity of food which will be exchange with the other islander
eve might however have choose to benefit herself and her family by use her increased efficiency in production to create great leisure for her and her family
there be nothing in gauthier s subjective theory of value to preclude eve from judge her leisure as a benefit
obviously for gauthier leisure be not the kind of benefit eve must produce in order for her appropriation to be justifiable because it would not enable her to compensate the others
the gain that eve must intend to produce for herself and her family must be benefit that be divisible exchangeable and value by the other islander
eve must therefore intend better housing or clothing for her family
in any case the quantity of exchanageable material good which eve must produce in order to justify her appropriation will depend upon the loss of the other islander
the other islander lose their use of eve s land the right to manage it the income from it the fight to trespass hunt gather and so on which before eve s appropriation they have in common
these can be significant loss
if the quantity of land on the island be large compare to the population this reduce the value of the loss of land due to eve s appropriation
but by the same reasoning if the population be large compare to quantity of land the loss will be substantial
suppose for the sake of argument that the only benefit or loss relevant to eve s appropriation be the food supply
this be a much too narrow assumption in light of the variety of right which the islander lose to eve but gauthier s derivation depend upon unrealistic assumption about the land
grant this assumption the increase in eve s food production must be great than the loss of naturally available food the islander could appropriate before eve s appropriation
gauthier assert without argument that eve can produce more food by agriculture than be available before her appropriation
intensive agriculture may not however always be more abundantly productive
a great deal depend upon the level of technology the fertility of the soil the amount of rainfall the length of the growing season and so forth
it be possible to imagine many counterinstances in which our ecosystem might not be make more productive through intensive agriculture
land in some arid climate might produce grass suitable for graze wild animal but be much too dry for raise vegetable and fruit
in some tropical rain forest topsoil would be wash away if the forest be clear for intensive agriculture
in such case eve s private appropriation would not be justifiable because she could not satisfy produce sufficient surplus food
these counterinstances may not be a objection to gauthier s argument if he be try to show that private appropriation be justifiable only under some special condition
gauthier may not be argue that private appropriation be always rationally justifiable because he do not believe either that the free market or moral by agreement be always rational
but if this be gauthier s intention he would have to show that the two failure be extensionally equivalent ie he would have to argue that private appropriation fail where and only where both the free market and moral by agreement be also irrational
gauthier would have to show that there be no possible example such as a simple pastoral society in which both the free market and moral by agreement be rational yet the land lack sufficient fertility for intensive agriculture to produce additional food
gauthier to my knowledge never address this point
still to give gauthier s argument a sympathetic reading attention may be focus upon the condition in which and her family
this surplus must be sufficiently large to compensate all those who lose by eve s appropriation
but to render this argument germane to the actual circumstance eve must confront it be necessary to drop the assumption that food be the only good which be gain or lose by eve and the other islander
gauthier must therefore prove that eve s surplus be great than the loss of others
even with this expanded assumption only some of eve s gain be relevant to calculate her ability to compensate the loser
as previously note eve could not choose to benefit herself with great leisure because these benefit be not divisible and exchangeable with others
nor could eve use her spare time to manufacture widget unless widget be value by the other islander
eve s gain be thus in principle easy to measure ie eve s gain be a specific quantity of foodstuff and perhaps raw material for clothing and shelter which she can offer in exchange
the loss incur by the other islander lose the right to hunt and gather on eve s land
they lose the right to trespass upon her land
and they lose the right to any of the natural resource such as water which may exist upon her land
the size and value of their loss can not be calculate in any general or abstract way
any gain and loss of each act of private appropriation have to be calculate in each particular case
suppose for example that the land eve select for intensitive cultivation be unremarkable except for its location in a flat valley between two mountain and eve s cultivation prevent others use the valley for passage between the mountain
the value of the lost right to trespass could conceivably be great than the value of the surplus eve produce especially if many lose the right to traverse her land
eve s appropriation of the flat land might also reduce land space for the others to build living quarter
eve s land may be a breeding ground for rabbit which be easily multiply
gauthier must assume in order for this argument to be plausible in general that amply productive land be the rule not the exception
if his argument be to justify private appropriation of land as a impartial original bargaining position he must assume that good fertile land be not so scarce that counterinstances arise only in rare or exceptional circumstance
not only do gauthier fail to supply argument to support his assumption that land be sufficiently abundant he also supply no argument to show that eve s primitive attempt at intensive agriculture can actually produce the required surplus
gauthier must provide such argument if his justification of private appropriation be to have any general plausibility
otherwise gauthier s argument at best show that private appropriation be justify only in a few special circumstance
i do not think there be general argument show that land exist in the abundance which gauthier s justification require
even if it be possible to show that unowned land do at some early time exist in such a would be successful
first it be questionable what relevance such abundance would now have for the issue of justify ownership of scarce land and resource
braybrooke s argument about the lack of historical applicability be relevant here
it do not seem to be rational to agree to govern our behavior in general and under all condition by moral rule which presuppose circumstance that be rarely encounter in our experience
second and more important the abundance of land require to make gauthier s argument plausible be likely to make the need for ownership moot
in order to minimize the loss which need to be compensate unowned land would have to be so plentiful that it be difficult to see the need for any form of ownership at all
no one would have a reason to try to interfere with eve under condition of abundance because the cost of interference would likely be high than the cost of appropriate without interfere with eve
the other islander would not logically have to acknowledge that eve have right over what she in these special circumstance they should not interfere with eve s appropriation because noninterference be most costeffective
as kraus and coleman point out the motive for rational individual in the state of nature to cooperate be the existence of costs but if eve s appropriation require so much abundance that there be practically no cost to others there be no need for any right of ownership eve can simply be ignore
as hume argue and as locke s river illustrate in abundance there be no need for ownership
gauthier s argument thus seem plausible because he presuppose unrealistic condition of abundance which render any form of land ownership unnecessary
""
ownership as theft
i borrow this title from proudhon not primarily because i believe that private ownership of land and resource be theft although i do believe it but because it point to a major difficulty in the form of ownership which gauthier attempt to justify in the previous section i have ignore the difference between gauthier s form of ownership argument with gauthier
i shall now show that gauthier s form of ownership warrant take what someone own without his permission hence the idea that gauthier s form of ownership resemble theft
the concept of private ownership must first be clarify in order to contrast it with gauthier s form
i shall rely upon am honore s work and define private ownership as be constitute by the right to possess the right to use the right to manage the right to income the right to the capital the right to security the right of transmissibility and absence of term honore s concept be consistent with that of john locke who say for truly i have no property in that which another can by right take from me against my consent
 let me call this locke s nontheft condition
this condition imply that the right which vest in private owner may not be take away against the owner s consent
while gauthier sometimes appear to recognize locke s nontheft of private ownership in other crucial places his form of ownership actually warrant take what another own without his consent
not only do gauthier violate locke s nontheft condition but his form of ownership may not be capable of actually be practice because of this violation
gauthier be well aware that his form of ownership differ from private ownership
eve the orignal appropriator do not gain all of the right enumerate on honore s list
eve do not first of all get the right to all use of her land nor secondly do she get the right to all possible income
if eve appropriate her plot of land with the intention of farming gauthier argue that her right of use over the land do not extend to any oil or other valuable mineral which might subsequently be discover on the land
gauthier s reason be that own the oil or mineral be not part of eve s original intention in appropriate the land and also that such a appropriation might make eve unclear why gauthier believe eve s original intention be relevant to the right of use she acquire over what she appropriate although he do follow kant here especially since intention be opaque or occur under a particular description while eve might appropriate the land with the intention of farming it might also be correct to describe her intention as a desire to use the land in any way that will maximize her family s utility
would gauthier have to concede that under this second description eve should receive the right to use any oil or other valuable mineral there be additional problem
suppose as in gauthier s original example eve do not obtain right over the subsurface mineral resource
if at some later time rosa wish to purchase eve s land in order to develop the mineral resource and assume rosa would not be a monopolist rosa could not acquire the mineral right with eve s land because eve do not have those right to sell
who have those right gauthier of the island collectively could exercise the right to subsurface mineral assume that anyone have those right
to vest right over what one own according to the intention at initial appropriation would create significant indeterminacy in actually practice gauthier s form of ownership
it would be difficult to prove where there be controversy what the initial appropriator s intention be at the time she first appropriate
after her death it may be impossible to ever establish beyond doubt what her intention be
ultimately it may become impossible to know what right owner may exercise over particular parcel of land especially since these right will vary from parcel to parcel because of the variety of initial intention
limit the use and management right of owner by their original intention make gauthier s form of ownership different from and much more restricted than private ownership where owner be not limit by their original intention
private ownership vest in owner be a unlimited right to use and manage what they own as they choose as long as they behave within a appropriator develop unowned land with a original intention of growing food but subsequently decide to use the land for a jogging track
private ownership which vest in owner the right to use the land as they please would permit this kind of change of use
private ownership would even permit the owner to let the land lie unused in any way
gauthier s form of ownership as he defend it would not permit a owner to change the use in this way
gauthier would have to argue that because a jogging track be not part of the original intention provided the intention could be determine and because the jogging track might not produce as much utility for everyone as do the growing of food the owner might not have any right to alter the use to which the land be put
the second difference between private ownership and gauthier s form illustrate how gauthier violate locke s nontheft condition
this difference concern the right to the income from what one own
gauthier believe rent produce by what they own
gauthier use the example of the income wayne gretzky may rightfully earn from the use of his self and his labor private ownership would vest in gretzky the right to any income he could obtain without force or fraud in a free market
gauthier argue that gretzky do not have this right
gretzky have no right to a income which exceed the minimum need to induce him to play hockey his marginal productivity because economic efficiency would not be achieve be he pay a premium or factor rent for his relatively scarce skill
this difference between the two set of ownership right be justify according to gauthier because his form promote economic efficiency and utility maximization in circumstance where a private ownership freemarket form do not
gauthier generalize from the gretzky example when he say in the state of nature if not always in society efficient use be a condition of rightful possession
although right be temporally openended they be subject to alteration in light of changed the right which vest in owner and may change the person in whom the fight vest
owner may lose right over what they own or even lose the thing they own if economic efficiency and utility could thereby be promote
the owner s consent be not a requirement according to gauthier for owner to lose what they own
thus locke s nontheft condition be clearly violate
locke s idea of private ownership and honore be as well do not restrict private owner to only economically efficient and utilitymaximizing use of what they own
there be a unresolvable problem which gauthier fail to notice when he say that in the state of nature efficient use be a condition of rightful possession
efficient use can only be measure after market be establish
market however presuppose not only that people already own something to exchange but also that the right over what they own be define and determinate
economic value depend upon the right which can be acquire
gauthier can not employ efficient use as make sense if the criteria for vest right be already presuppose
not only do gauthier s form of ownership violate locke s nontheft condition his form of ownership also violate what i call hume s dictum
hume s dictum be that possession must be stable no matter what else ownership rule happen to do not only must people be able to know what they own and what their right be but they must be able to know under what condition they may lose right over what they own and importantly be able to more or less control the condition under which they lose their right to what they own
gauthier s example of eve s appropriation rely upon the wisdom contain in hume s dictum
eve must be able to rely upon a fairly uninterrupted possession of her land in order for her improvement of the land to be rational
she must be able to count upon recoup her cost
if eve expect to enjoy the benefit of her labor she must be without any interference from others
other must not have the right to take what she improve and produce
this be why gauthier be correct in argue that some form of ownership be a necessary prerequisite for eve rationally to undertake her economically beneficial farming
ignore for the moment the circularity in attempt to define rightful possession in the state of nature by the criteria of efficient use gauthier do not seem to appreciate that his own condition of efficient use may undermine the stability of possession
suppose that the very real problem of decide who be to judge who be a efficient user and who be to judge efficient use for which purpose can somehow be resolve there be still the difficulty that deciding ownership upon efficient use may render possession too unstable to be efficiently develop or use
in the treatise hume discuss just this point he consider a actutilitarian criteria of title which would vest the right of ownership in person who could make the best use of what be own
the problem hume see with this criteria uncertain
 a person who might make the best use of something today might not be the person who could make the best use of it tomorrow
this uncertainty may deter owner from make investment in what they own because others might be able to make more economically efficient use of it
eve for example might be deter from improve her land for farming if she fear that rosa might find a still more efficient use and rightfully claim the land
allocate ownables by a criteria of best or efficient use may paradoxically imply less good or efficient use because people may refrain from risky investment and improvement
efficient use be selfdefeating where it violate hume s dictum
ownership be less secure in gauthier s form of ownership than in private ownership
gauthier might try to respond to this criticism by claim that in actual practice ownership will not be so uncertain as to undermine economically desirable improvement and investment
his argument will have to be ground upon premise concerning risk propensity and aversion ongoing debate over whether a propensity or aversion to risk be subject to rational assessment or whether it be merely a psychological disposition
even if it could be establish that there be rational condition for risk gauthier would still need to argue that his efficient use criteria would leave ownership sufficiently certain and stable for risk to be rational
but be such argument possible they could not be absolute or general
gauthier would have to examine actual condition in order to estimate the effect of his criteria of ownership on certainty and stability of possession in relation to rational risk
i have ignore gauthier s point that compensation may be pay to the less efficient user if what be own be appropriate by a more efficient user require compensation will reduce risk uncertainty and instability
i ignore compensation to isolate the problem in violate hume s dictum
compensation as gauthier be aware do lessen the problem
but lessen the problem in this case may or may not remove it
if compensation be person whose right be appropriate can establish the value to her of what be take away then ownership may not be sufficiently uncertain to violate hume s dictum
but a subjective evaluation of the level of compensation do not guarantee economic efficiency in fact it may obstruct economic efficiency eg in case where homeowner refuse even outrageously large offer from real estate developer
the idea of market value compensation might be think to be more appropriate
market value compensation be problematic as i note early discuss gretzky and efficient use because market value as well as efficiency presuppose determinate criteria for rightful possession
even so in situation where market value be less than subjective value the problem of uncertainty would not be solve
for high risk or for very costly improvement gauthier s efficient use criteria even with the payment of compensation may have the effect of reduce economic efficiency rather than promote it
i therefore do not believe gauthier have avoid the difficulty hume see in violate his dictum
 form of ownership which closely resemble private ownership by a argument from original appropriation in the state of nature fail in the way all such argument fail
they fail because of the unrealistic condition which must be presuppose and because of the partial questionbegging argument which be employ
i have show that even gauthier s ingenious argument fail to overcome the problem inherent in all stateofnature derivation
thus my contention that all stateofnature derivation fail still hold without exception
philosopher must avoid try to justify ownership by this unrealistic and therefore irrelevant method
gauthier s justification of a form of ownership also have problem which be independent of his method of argument
unlike private ownership gauthier s form of ownership justify sometimes rightfully take what a person own without that person s consent
this violation of locke s nontheft condition may also lead to a violation of hume s dictum
i have discuss these violation more fully in my book under the heading of the necessary logical structure of ownership
the failure of form of ownership demonstrate that philosopher
as philosopher continue to try to find moral justification for a form of ownership they must first show that the form they be try to justify fulfill the necessary logical requirement of ownership
instead of rely upon state of nature argument philosopher need to follow a methodology i have call a schema of justification a schema of justification illustrate the application of concept to actual empirical condition
a moral justification of a form of ownership would have to fulfill three task
first the form of ownership would have to be show to meet the necessary logical structure of all form of ownership second the form of ownership would have to either be derive from some rationally ground moral principle or if rational grounding be judge impossible be show to be consistent with our fundamental moral intuition
and third the actual societal condition in which the form of ownership be to be apply must be examine to determine what the rationally ground moral principle or our fundamental moral intuition require in each specific circumstance
always be able to demonstrate how to rectify injustice which occur in any actual circumstance but no methodology that i know of seem to be capable of accomplish such a task
a schema of justification nevertheless avoid the oversimplification and abstraction inherent in stateofnature argument
a schema of justification guarantee moral relevance
and because a schema of justification require that form of ownership be test against the necessary logical structure of all form of ownership there be a guarantee that it be at least possible to put the form of ownership into actual practice

buffalo state college
over the last decade and a half a group of philosopher have argue that justice be equivalent to or at least involve the historically base entitlement of a person to certain objects the principle which identify the source of those entitlement define a set of right hold by all human being according to these author
when this historical entitlement theory be conjoin to a theory of selfownership it constitute the libertarian theory of justice a theory which identify justice with the rightful entitlement of person to themselves and to certain object that they acquire by specified mean and to the freedom to use both as they choose
as such it be more than merely a theory of distributive justice for it delineate what it take to be a exhaustive list of right some of which be distributive or economic right but one of which be a right of selfownership which imply a right of selfgovernance or personal liberty
moreover this exhaustive list specify according to the libertarian both the purpose of governmental this list as well as its legitimate boundary ie the obligation to protect only those right and the duty to refrain from violation of them
while various aspect of this libertarian conception of justice have be laboriously investigate little attention have be devote to its implication for the theory of civil and criminal remediation this essay be a attempt to rectify that omission
in it i will argue that the libertarian theory in particular as explicate by nozick have certain implication for the theory of remediation that be startle and oppose to his own view about the appropriate public response to wrongdoing
specifically i will argue first that the libertarian thesis both entail a restitutionist and compensatory theory of remediation and exclude punitive remedial principles accordingly i will also maintain that the conception of toolong arise from libertarian consideration require the elimination of the criminal law as we know it
finally i will argue that libertarian theory as frame by nozick can not offer any justification for capital punishment but certain category of wrongdoer
along the way i will contend that some of these unexpected result arise due to the exiguous grounding provide for the libertarian scheme of justice by nozick and i will suggest that their resolution require a more robust ethical foundation
that recommended foundation however will only advance the case for compensatory remedy where restitution be not available
it will not provide support for criminal sanction as we traditionally conceive of them

remediation and justice
in order to determine which theory of remediation be entail by the libertarian thesis it will be necessary to formulate the view of justice which be expound in that thesis and the concomitant theory of wrongdoing which be imply by it
justice as conceivedof by libertarian theorist consist in the preservation of one s freedom of action with respect to those object to which one have legitimate title
these object include one s person and those extrapersonal object which one have justly acquire
to such object the holder have exclusive title
another category and unappropriated extrapersonal object as long as these action be take in accordance with certain rule which assure to all actor compatible sphere of autonomy
so define this conception of justice implicitly specify what sort of action be not in agreement with it ie be unjust those which consist in the use of object to which one do not have appropriate title but to which another person do or in the damage ie the alteration of such object
thus action in any society govern by strict application of libertarian principle will be consider rightful if they be take with respect to object own by their user if they be take with respect to object wherein permission have be voluntarily grant by the owner to another person to make use of them or if they be take with respect to object over which as in the case of unowned and unappropriated object one have certain usufructuary right
action which employ or alter object not own by their may employ suitable defense to prevent or resist such action
while the question of what would constitute a suitable defense be interesting enough the principal focus of this paper will be on what the appropriate ie the just response to a successfully complete unjust action of this kind ought to be
such a response could conceivably fall into one of three broad category response which seek recompense for the victim those which attempt solely to affect in some way the wrongdoer or some combination of the two
furthermore it be clear that unjust action can affect either one s extrapersonal holding or oneself or both
while it be obvious at least in outline what kind of act would be impermissible within a code of entitlementprotecting statute the sanction that would be provide for in that code be not immediately evident
would the law confine itself to the compensation of offended party or would it alternatively or additionally provide for punitive sanction would the latter if a disrupted moral balance by exact a retribution or would they be assign in order to prevent instance of wrongdoing in the future and if punitive remedy be inappropriate to a entitlement conception of justice what sanction would conform to it in case of personal injury where the realized harm be intend by its perpetrator and more problematically in the limiting case of murder
generally we can say that if any category of attempted remedial action systematically fail to restore a transgress entitlement it can not be the response require by the libertarian theory of justice because it fail to redress the particular injustice identify by that theory
that is there may be other ground for recommend such a response but they be not one provide by the libertarian thesis
furthermore if a suggested response to wrongdoing itself violate someone s right it be forbid by this theory of justice
""
the nature of rightful entitlement
the appropriate response to various category of wrongdoing according to entitlement theory must be of a rightful action in a entitlement context
such a analysis be embody in the following principle definition of rightful title a title to a human object be rightful if and only if it be claim with respect to one s own person
a title to a nonhuman object be rightful if and only if it be acquire by nozick s principle of justice in acquisition nja or nozick s principle of justice in transfer njt
a rightful title to a object o under description d be retain by its owner even if o be transform to on under dn
rightful title to any object be attain only by 
definition of rightfuluse action a action a be rightful and hence permissible if the actor a employ object human or nonhuman to which he have rightful title
a action a be rightful and hence permissible if the actor a employ previously untitled object according to nja
a action a employ object to which he do not have title with the uncoerced permission of those who do and only in way specify by them
no action be permissible except when perform in accordance with 
principle of rightfultransformation action a object o may be transform to on by a actor a if he have rightful title to it
a untitled object ou may be transform to oun by a actor a according to and only accord to nja
a object which be own by another may be transform with and only with the uncoerced permission of its rightful owner and only in way specify by him
no act of transformation be rightful except when perform in accordance with 
we conclude then that a wrongful action be one which violate the principle of rightfuluse action or the principle of rightfultransformation action
the wrong produce consist either of the illicit use of a object belong to another the illicit transformation of a object belong to another of a unowned object the wrongful act emerge from be implicitly define by nja
since nja be a largely undeveloped principle within contemporary entitlement theory and a subject of great controversy we will not attempt to characterize the wrongful act generate by violation of it
however the wrong describe by clearly consist in deprive the rightful owner of the use of his object o from time t to tn while the wrong delineate by consist in deprive the rightful owner of the use of his object o from t to tn and leave him with the use of the altered object on to which he retain title
in the former case he have be deprive of the use and fruit of use o from t to tn only
in the latter case he have be deprive of the use and fruit of the use of o permanently begin at t and obtain the use of which he be deprive in both instance be rightfully his the commission of the wrongful act in either case require that these use and effect be restore to him
however as they can not be perfectly restore to him in either case since the time interval during which he be deprive of the object s use be permanently lose to him and the object in the second case have be alter he have the right to claim their imperfect or approximate restoration
once this restoration have take place then according to entitlement theory the entitlement have be restore and hence the wrong however imperfectly and approximately have be remedy

nonutilitarian compensation
before consider whether any far ie punitive response to wrongful action of type or can be claim on libertarian ground i will examine a dilemma which it have be allege accompany the libertarian theory of remediation as it pertain to restitution
lawrence davis have argue that the restitutionism imply by libertarian a good many small injustice
""
""
to be declare unrectifiable davis s argument be that nozick s entitlement theory identify a particular distribution of holding as
just if and only if each person s holding under some distribution dx include and only include those particular object to which he be entitle by nozick s principle of justice in acquisition transfer and rectification
but assume say davis that i steal a banana which rightly belong to you and eat it
thereafter he argue no just distribution can be achieve for your entitlement be to a particular banana which no long exist
no rectification be possible since your stolen entitlement can not be return to you
a theory of remediation which provide no possible remedy for such transgression would appear profoundly deficient
davis suggest that rather than agree to such consequence nozick might appeal to the theory of compensation delineate by him in part i of anarchy state and utopia
there a person who have be indifference curve as he would have be on have the transgression not take place and this constitute compensation for the transgression nozick might davis argue replace the notion of remediation as have one s particular property return to one with the following criteria of rectification the transgress entitlement have be restore if the victim be indifferent between a compensated present state and a past state untainted by any transgression of entitlement
according to this substitute principle good which make the offended party indifferent between the destroyed holding to which he be entitle and those use to compensate him for their loss constitute a legitimate recompense
while this latter principle solve the problem of find a suitable remedy when one s entitlement no long exist or be damage beyond repair its adoption threaten to eviscerate the whole of the historical entitlement thesis indeed if utility be to be substitute for entitlement in the principle of rectification why not substitute it for the other two division of nozick s theory of distributive justice justice in the acquisition of every member of society between past and present holding be a suitable substitute for the historical entitlement criteria of distributive justice then there be no morally inflexible claim of individual to particular object
the abandonment of entitlement criteria of distribution in one part of the theory may be the genesis of a slippery slope which threaten its other part
for example suppose i forcibly prevent you from acquire a object but then compensate you such that you be indifferent between the holding that without my intervention you would have have and the compensation that i have give you
entitlement theory proscribe such forcible interference whereas this utilitarian substitute would permit them provided that the victim be suitably compensate
similarly transfer of property could be forcibly prevent and fully justify if the requisite compensatory action be take by the aggressor
nozick then appear catch on the horn of a dilemma
the entitlement theory strictly apply would allow certain wrong to go unrectified while the utilitybased theory of compensation which could extricate the entire theory
this particular dilemma seem to be resolvable
i will argue that if the theory of right which nozick defend but do not deduce from any more fundamental moral or factual thesis be give a particular type of justification then utility can indeed be introduce to solve the remediation problem without thereby jeopardize the integrity of nozick s libertarian commitment in other sphere of distributive justice
while i can only schematically present the sort of justification for libertarianism that will reconcile these apparently disparate element this presentation should be sufficient to indicate how a utility criteria for the rectification of wrong can be infuse into the body of nozick s right theory without mortally wound it
right be sometimes describe as social condition necessary for the satisfaction of certain commonly hold but separately seek objective
for example in reason and morality alan gewirth argue that right be social claim which be deducible from the fact that human being by nature strive to fulfill purpose
similarly loren lomasky in person right necessary social condition to which hypothetical contractor would agree in order to realize their longrange personal project
according to gewirth s theory these right be identical in content for every person because the social condition require for purpose fulfillment be determine by certain universal feature of human nature
thus the right which logically must be claim by human being can not vary from person to person
if this gewirthian sort of argument could be so revised as to support nozick s right of historical entitlement then the property right of libertarian theory would have be justify as the condition which must be rationally claim as necessary mean to purpose fulfillment
probably give the moral theory adumbrate in philosophical explanation nozick himself would not defend property right in this way
however my point here be that such a defense can conceivably be devise for the right propound in anarchy state and utopia
gewirth for example argue that freedom of action be a necessary condition of purpose fulfillment
one can imagine a defend by nozick
indeed lomasky make just such a argument in his book
that is suppose it be maintain that the satisfaction of purpose require the possession of the material mean necessary to such satisfaction
it could be far argue that such mean be only produce by the effort of specific individual and that in order to assure their availability for purpose fulfillment to those who produce them or trade for them absolute title to them must be guarantee to those person
where that guarantee be transgress by theft it would follow from the entitlement thesis itself that the stolen object be return to its owner
but where the stolen object have be destroy or consume and hence can not be return it would seem that a argument for suitable recompense could be devise which would have the same logical lineage as the purposebased deduction of the generic right of historical entitlement
that is if it could be argue that absolute property right be necessary to satisfy the purpose of those who fashion the property stolen object can not be return to their owner substitute object which equally satisfy the owner purpose would serve them as legitimate recompense
one way of measure equal satisfaction would be the indifference criteria propose by nozick
if it could be far contend that the transgressor incur a obligation to make recompense because of his transgression then he be obligate to supply whatever substitute will raise his victim to the appropriate indifference curve
and that substitute because it be require to replace the transgress entitlement of the victim can no long be claim by the transgressor as his legitimate property
its transfer from transgressor to victim rectify a unjust distribution of good by remove from the transgressor s holding good which he owe to his victim in virtue of his transgression and to which therefore he be no long entitle
such a justification might enable nozick to retain the criteria of historical entitlement in all area of distributive concern except in those instance of rectificatory justice in which the object no long exist for there the he would have otherwise experience in virtue of his possession of object to which he and only he be rightfully entitle and of which he be illegitimately deprive
on this view the principle of historical entitlement must be uphold as the mean necessary for purpose fulfillment generally
however when a entitlement have be illegitimately destroy and the guilty party have thereby incur a obligation to make recompense to his victim it be appropriate that a satisfying substitute be convey to the victim from the transgressor s holding because the transgressor in virtue of his obligation no long strictly retain title to those of his possession which could be use to remedy his wrongdoing and the purpose of his victim which be previously satisfy by the destroyed entitlement can be equally satisfy by a portion of the transgressor s asset
thus it be plausible to think that nozick s theory of compensation could be integrate into his doctrine of rectification without thereby eviscerate the entire entitlement thesis
""
the entitlement theory and punishment
appropriate punitive measure for wrongdoing without undercut the entitlement theory in his philosophical explanation nozick be unequivocal in his support for retributive punishment while throughout anarchy state and utopia he seem to assume that there be no theoretical opposition between his libertarianism and punitive remedy for wrongdoing
we may test the correctness of this assumption by answer two question
first can punishment whether employ for deterrence incapacitation or retribution be derive as a principle of remediation from libertarian theory second if it can not be so derive be punishment at least compatible with libertarian principle
let us consider the two type of wrongdoing to which we previously allude the illicit use of a object belong to another and the illicit tranformation of a object belong to another
let us expand the second category of wrongdoing so as to include the illicit destruction or consumption of object
restated then 
would proscribe the illicit transformation destruction or consumption of libertarian theory endorse both a principle of selfentitlement as well as a principle of the historical entitlement of human being to nonhuman object let us be careful to understand that and apply both to human and nonhuman object
now we may ask once restitution or compensation for wrong or have be achieve can any far remedy for them be exact on entitlement ground this be our derivation question
the answer to this question seem to be no
if the removal of a entitlement be the wrong created restoration of that entitlement or suitable compensation for its loss be the only possible remedy that can serve as a moral corrective
as for the possible imprisonment of the wrongdoer such a action must be instrumental to the restorative process in order to be give a entitlement justification
if for example it could be argue that a thief would not make his victim whole unless incarcerate and compel to do so then his imprisonment would be the entitlement theory then would seem to sanction only restitution or compensation as a appropriate moral response to wrongdoing
punishment when not implement as a mean of either restore transgress entitlement or produce recompense for them become a morally superfluous exercise
since the wrongful act must always be measure only in terms of its effect upon the offended holder or his duly appoint beneficiary of a entitlement any action take either purely in order to punish the wrongdoer or to prevent or inhibit future criminal action while it may be morally compatible with the libertarian criteria of justice receive no additional support from it
these two point require far elaboration
first there be the matter of punishment
it might be argue that entitlement theory in fact do entail some retributivist component as it must or ought to distinguish between degree of culpability by add to compensatory remedy punitive one as well
surely it may be contend the law should not assign the same sanction for manslaughter as it do for murder be identical the extent of responsibility for each offense differ vastly
libertarian theory it can be maintain ought to recognize this difference by insinuate a retributive constituent into its conception of criminal justice
but while the libertarian theorist be not preclude from acknowledge the full spectrum of moral culpability which can attend any harmful act there be no room for the inclusion of the culpability factor in his formulation of just response to wrongdoing
injustice consist wholly in illicit taking or damage
hence justice must consist exclusively in replacement restoration or compensation from a specific individual or individual
furthermore any additional action take against the person or holding of a wrongdoer beyond what be require either for the restoration of taken or damaged entitlement to the victim or for the compensation of the victim where restoration be impossible will result in a violation of the right of the wrongdoer not a justifiable remedial response to his wrongdoing
thus if a object belong to a be take forcibly from him by b a suitable remedy would be the return of the object plus the return of whatever benefit would have accrue to a during its absence and the compensation for any consequential damage suffer by a as a result of its removal
the principle involve here be that a be entitlement and their fruit to which ceteris paribus he would also be entitle be illicitly take by b and therefore be owe to him by b however to take more from b than be remove or damage by him be to take from him what be own by him and be not owe by him to anyone else
criminal debt on entitlement ground can only arise from the nonconsensual taking or alteration by someone of a entitlement that be not his
once that debt be discharge by the wrongdoer any additional forcible taking of object including his physical person own by the wrongdoer constitute the illicit seizure of a unencumbered entitlement and hence be itself a wrongdoing
punitive reaction to the nonconsensual use of the wrongdoer s entitlement be itself a wrong and as such require restitutive remedy
and if this be true for punishment which seek retribution from the actor for his moral error then it be true as well for punishment whose purpose be to deter or prevent by incapacitation or forcible rehabilitation the commission of future wrongful act
therefore entitlement theory not only fail to provide justification for punitive measure which exceed what be require to make rightful restitution andor compensation but it imply the wrongfulness of such measure
thus the answer to our second question be that the use of punishment as a remedy for wrongdoing be incompatible with libertarian theory
now this implication be surprising enough suggest as it do that libertarian theorist must argue for the elimination of the criminal law leave only tort and contract law in its place
however a still strong result become apparent when one begin to consider what sort of sanction libertarian theory can endorse for murder
while libertarian theory could subscribe to the view the victim for the loss of the future estate to which they would have be title and that he must suffer the loss of sufficient freedom to assure the fulfillment of that obligation it can hardly recommend that in addition he lose his life
for what would be restore in the process the life of his victim would not thereby be recover nor would the murderer s execution restore or repair any of the entitlement of the victim s heir
for these heir be not entitle to the victim who like all human being be according to libertarian theory entitle to himself
moreover once these heir have be compensate no far debt remain to be discharge
the execution of the murderer then would not only fail to serve a compensatory purpose it would be wrong as well for it would deprive the murderer of his entitlement to his physical person
it may be maintain against this disturbing result that the murderer have take the life of another own life imply the appropriateness or the absence of the inappropriateness of his execution or at least of his imprisonment beyond the term necessary to assure the recompense of the victim s heir
but what would be the basis of such a claim within libertarian theory perhaps the libertarian could contend that in take the life of his victim the murderer create a debt which can only be discharge through the taking of his own life
but to whom would this debt be own certainly the libertarian entitlement theorist can not argue that the debt be owe the family or heir of the victim for the entitlement conception adhere to the view that each person and therefore the victim be the exclusive owner of his own person
similarly the debt can not be literally owe the victim who be obviously in no position to collect
nor can the debt be owe to society its member have not be deprive of any of their entitlement through this murder
only one circumstance might ground
if someone unsuccessfully attempt to murder but nevertheless injure another and his victim require the transplantation of a organ in order to survive the injury that organ may be wrest from the attacker even if that should jeopardize the assailant s own life
if without the transfer of his own life to another the assailant will have successfully deprive another of his existence then the attacker become a debtor whose life if need be may be take to restore the life of his victim
give the radical restorationism imply by the libertarian entitlement theory it be not surprising that one of its adherent have defend restitution as a substitute for punishment in the allocation of criminal justice
what randy barnett in a essay argue for the elimination of retributivist and utilitarian standard of criminal justice do not do be to explicitly link his restitutionism to the entitlement theory so obviously embrace by him
what be surprising be that one of his critic also a libertarian entitlement theorist have maintain
that the civil remedy by itself be altogether inadequate in the case of criminal act
for the element miss from the mere tort but present in the criminal act be the guilty mind
the criminal have not simply harm you
he have affront your dignity
he have intentionally use you against your will for his own end
he can not simply pay damage as though his action be accidental or unintentional
how would this right the wrong 
therefore pilon argue
the original act thus create a right in the victim to use the criminal as he himself be use
only so will the party be treat as equal
for only so will the character of the original act be reflect in the remedy 
now this argument be ingenious it may even be correct
however in order for it to go through pilon must transcend the entitlement conception of justice that manifestly inform his view for it simply be not imply by that conception count among one s entitlement or holding as nozick call them a affronted dignity can not constitute a damaged property
however dignity may be characterize its status as a holding be dubious for it be neither a mental capacity like intelligence judgment memory nor a physical one
if dignity be not a holding or property its damage do not create a debt in its assailant that may be claim by the affronted party
clearly the libertarian entitlement theory alone will neither support nor tolerate punitive remedy
if such remedy be desirable on other ground adherent of the libertarian entitlement theory must import other complementary principle on which to make a defense of them or abandon the entitlement theory altogether
if the former appear unattainable and the latter be unattractive the libertarian theoretician must be content with restitutive or compensatory mean of rectify injustice
jeffrey paul
social philosophy and policy center bowl green state university
john locke believe that each person have a natural right to hold property particularly the fruit of his own labor it be through the mixing of one s own labor with land and its product that a right to appropriate and own property arise
but that right as we all know be subject to what robert nozick call and what have since become familiar as locke s proviso
 thus a integral part of locke s defense of private property turn on its omnipresent availability for appropriation in the state of nature
that is there must be unclaimed land as well as the produce of land free for the taking
the original appropriation of property by one person can be just only if enough and as good be available to the rest of humanity 
enough and as good the proviso in the state of nature
what do locke mean by his proviso more specifically how egalitarian be it mean to be of nature the less it would seem able to justify unequal property right under condition of scarcity 
locke put forward his proviso in at least three place in his famous chapter xxv in the first appearance he say
 for this labor be the unquestionable property of the labourer no man but he can have a right to what that be once join to at least where there be enough and as good left in common for others emphasis add
in the second he say
 nor be this appropriation of any parcel of land by improve it any prejudice to any other man since there be still enough and as good left and more than the yet unprovided could use emphases in original
the third version be much less often identify and discuss but be nonetheless a clear formulation of the proviso
a man could appropriate property by mix his labor with it
 so that to entrench upon the right of another or acquire to himself a property to the prejudice of his neighbor who would still have room for as good and as large possession after the others have take out his as before it be appropriated emphasis add
do these three formulation imply that individual in the state of nature must be equal in property holding however we interpret property holding some writer suggest that a condition of equality in the stock of land and produce of the land must exist after a appropriation
in all case hereafter i mean by a appropriation of land a lockean appropriation perform by mix one s labor with it
alan ryan follow other contemporary commentator and translate the proviso as require as much and as good be leave to others even though locke never use such a formulation
vincent barry require that in the state of nature two condition exist the individual be equal where this second condition clearly refer to some sort of equality of resources 
could locke have mean by enough and as good that equal amount of property must be available to each person to appropriate in the state of nature could he have mean that people actually must appropriate and thereafter own equal amount of property for if either requirement be part of locke s starting point equality of resource loom far large as a desideratum for locke than we might otherwise think
this in turn might weaken a broadly lockean commitment to strong property right in poststateofnature condition of relative scarcity ie where the proviso do not hold
this be precisely the direction take by virginia hold vincent barry and others as we shall see
what then could locke have mean by enough and as good enough whatever else can not mean a equal amount
it refer to some other characteristic of what by he who have already appropriate land or good of the land
it seem to compare what others have before a appropriator call him a appropriate and what those same others have after a be appropriation and whether their position have be worsen
it could mean that there must be enough leave that those who have not yet appropriate land do not have so little leave as to make them suffer physical deprivation for lack of property
but there be no textual evidence for this
a more demanding requirement would be that others be no bad off for the appropriation
this i believe be clearly what locke mean
in the second formulation of the proviso locke add a strong conjunct to enough and as good
that be there must still be more left than those who have not yet appropriate could use
so if they have more than they could use before a appropriation and more than they could use after then relative amount as appropriate be irrelevant 
the third formulation give added credibility to this reading because it require as large a possession leave to be appropriate
and clearly here locke mean not as large as that appropriate by a but as large as be there before the appropriation
but how could as large a possession be leave after some of it have be appropriate obviously only if the amount of land and its produce be practically unlimited so that a single appropriation make no practical difference to the amount still available
indeed locke tell us just this in a passage follow the second formulation
so that in effect there be never less left for others because of his enclosure for himself
for he that leave as much as another can make use of do as good as take nothing at all emphasis add
a few line later he compare such enclosure of land to take a drink out of a river
do it make any practical sense to say that what could locke mean by as good which appear in all three formulation of the proviso it can not mean as much as a have appropriate since then the force of enough or as large in the third formulation would be nugatory
the preposition as must compare ex ante and ex post situation of those have not yet appropriate all those except a
it seem a simple requirement that the quality of the land which be leave be the same
this make a important point because locke believe in the enormous multiplicative effect of labor upon land
one reason why the proviso can plausibly be effective in the state of nature in addition to the vast amount of land available be that mixing labor with land so increase its value and the reward reap from it
locke begin by say labor can increase the value of land tenfold then a hundredfold and at one point a thousandfold the point be that of inequality than any slight discrepancy in size of original appropriation
if you appropriate two acre while i appropriate only one and we both leave our land unimproved you have twice what i do but if i get maximum value out of my land by great industry and application of reason i might end up with time your wealth while own only half your original amount of property
locke however make clear that he be totally indifferent to even such radical disparity in wealth so that equality per se must be completely irrelevant to him 
the remarkable power of labor to produce so vast a multiplication of wealth might help explain the force of as good
locke clearly think of property in chapter xxv as real property and its product
thus he must require that the acreage left be as responsive to labor input as it be before a appropriation else the overwhelming force of labor input to create wealth could be lose
i submit then by that as original value to labor improved value
concretely for agriculture he mean as fertile and arable
""
there be yet another way that labor improvement can make up for relatively slight inequality in size of original appropriation
while there be no money and thus no sophisticated commerce we can assume that there be barter and there be some textual evidence of wage employment locke make clear that the labormixing appropriator be net benefactor to the rest of mankind
barter and wage labor be probably the mechanism he have in mind in a simple premoney economy barter allow some specialization to emerge produce at least some gain from trade and the division of labor
this improve the lot of all
it therefore seem clear that locke s concern within the state of nature be paretian
that be be i better off or leave the same after a appropriate his land or do his appropriation make me bad off
locke s concern be not egalitarian
he be not concerned with a this bear powerfully upon argument which use the force of the proviso outside the state of nature
let us see how this be so
a moral problem in the acquisition of property outside the state of nature
needless to say the state of nature be a fiction in most society there be no long a frontier which constitute such a source of unclaimed property
it would surely seem then that there be no source of unclaimed new property
if this be correct we can only acquire property from some fixed finite stock all of which be already claim by our fellow
it may seem that i can accumulate property ultimately become wealthy only by get that additional property from others
the mean of obtain such increment of wealth may have to be somehow illicit
we shall investigate that possibility below
but ignore that problem for the moment it would still seem that such accumulation of property might deny others their fair share ie access out that after the invention of money i can accumulate property beyond my own ability to use or consume it so far as this accumulation of property might deny others enough and as good as it appear it could without a source of free unappropriated property it violate locke s proviso 
indeed this argument have be make both against the notion of private property as a right and against capitalism as a system dependent upon that right
virgnia hold say
even more serious for this attempt to justify moral right to property be the dificulty that the lockean proviso in the contemporary world of overpopulation and scarce resource can almost never be meet
instead more property for some will almost always bring about less for others emphasis add
vincent barry have take the same position
as they capitalist accumulate more and more property there be less and less for others
the relative position of the party with respect to property be not equal necessity lose perhaps locke provide a adequate defense of property in a hypothetical state of nature in which supply be inexhaustible and individual be equal but that blissful eden do not exist
and yet modern capitalism seemingly operate as if it does emphases added
note the zerosum nature of property accumulation assume by both hold and barry
i acquire more property only by take property from you and all others
similar position which suggest but do not explicitly state this argument be take by laurence becker and am honore 
this analysis if it can be maintain constitute a devastating moral argument against private property
if hold and barry be correct there be only two kind of transfer of property
the first be the sort of justicepreserving transfer of entitlement to property envision by nozick
however for hold and barry these transaction must be for equal value and can not explain the unequal accumulation of property
thus you swap something to which you be justly entitle for entitled such transfer be zerosum in the sense that neither of us gain or lose ie gain andor loss equal zero the kind of transfer which hold and barry describe be also zerosum the law call the conversion
more property for some bring about less for others hold tell us
as one have gain the others have lose say barry
that is i get something from you for nothing they be zerosum because i be ahead some amount and you lose a equal amount 
with the exception of the unusual case of a intentional gift this kind of transfer be by definition wrongful presumably carry out by force or fraud or at least exploitation of mistake or imprudence
thus any inequality in a freemarket society and there be undeniably a great deal condemn the source of the inequality as the result of something morally very similar to theft
thus this line of argument proceeds the system constitute the source of this inequality
ergo the system be base upon immoral or at the very least morally unjustified conversion
one reason why it seem clear that hold and barry assume this zerosum theory be the one example adduce by both
barry give the enclosure movement as a case of capitalist get rich by take from others
it be the perfect historical example of their theory of inequality be produce by zerosum transfer indeed that barry choose the enclosure movement as the primary example of property accumulation reveal how deep the zerosum notion be in this view
let us set out briefly and roughly how the enclosure movement transpired under feudal tenure much of the land in a manor be common
that is tenant could use it for pasturage and in some case for crop subject to various feudal duty owe to the lord
all of the right duty and privilege involve be deeply feudal in character
the peasant right be either customary or the notion of legal title evolve toward modern fee simple the lord s ownership become more absolute and less burden with these customary peasant claim
at the same time a huge market for wool develop
thus it become profitable for the lord to enclose these commons and run his own sheep thereby ignore the peasant customary rights generally the newly emerging law of property support this revocation of old and often only customary right
indeed during the eighteenth century private act of parliament expedit the process 
note that it take only a small abstraction from this example to reach something like a lockean state of nature
heretofore the commons be own in common though with unequal privilege and benefit
then lord bad enclose appropriate the land as his exclusive property deny its use to peasant good nice and kind
antecedently bad good nice and kind have let us say acre to use
now and kind be out acre ex ante own in common
i think we must agree with barry if we assume custom can be a source of right which i do that the enclosure movement at least as here simplistically represent constitute a wrongful as well as a zerosum take
but what would make barry and hold as well believe that the enclosure movement be characteristic of capitalist property acquisition or accumulation indeed prima facie it seem dramatically atypical
property usually change hand for valuable consideration
how could they arrive at this conclusion let us see
what be the nature of the wrong in such conversion as the enclosure movement it may well be that the wrong be deontological in nature a violation of a right to property
where nozick see such conversion this be the only reason for their wrongfulness although for nozick the class of wrongful conversion be much narrow than for hold and barry but there be one
first such transfer will lead to relative inequality
this would be a problem for hold and barry but not for locke as we see nor for nozick nor for the author hold and barry be egalitarian with respect to transaction
locke nozick and the author be paretians
however most would agree hold and barry include that there be a second and more serious consequential wrong in a world without the frontier ie with a closed and finite stock of property
that is sufficient inequality might well lead to physical deprivation and suffering as it will not in locke s state of nature since sufficient land and its produce be always present there to prevent it
thus on this account in the closed finite property case i can accumulate two more unit of property only by deny them to you and to everyone else on the assumption that antecedently you have their use and enjoyment
think of the enclosure example where great be deny you and very little or none left for you then you might well have so little that you suffer
it be the physical deprivation and poverty that result from this kind of unequal distribution which virtually everyone find objectionable
that locke find it so be illustrate by his proviso require enough viz at least to avoid deprivation while we interpret locke to mean something much strong than this by enough it certainly include a prohibition on physical deprivation
let us now state their view explicitly and concisely
the heldbarry thesis the accumulation of property outside the state of nature in the hand of one person logically require the denial of a equal amount of property to others lessen their stock of property by the amount accumulate by the first person
this accumulation and denial pursue far enough will lead to deprivation and suffering
the realproperty paradigm
the heldbarry thesis logically depend upon what we might call a zerosum characteristic of property
this is land outside the state of nature where there be no frontier
all of locke s thought seem to be base on the identification of property with land and the agricultural product of land although this distinction be not always make clear
other early modern discussion of property also depend upon its identification with land 
what be the zerosum characteristic of land as archetypal property there be three salient logical characteristic of real property
first if i own a oneacre piece of property blackacre let us call it i have a right to prevent you and all others from own or use that specific parcel of land
second without a practically unlimited source of property ie a frontier there be a finite and limited amount of land the amount be fix ie it will neither grow nor shrink
as my farmer neighbor in ohio say they ai nt makin any more of it
third from the first reduce the total stock of land by one acre which be available to you to use or acquire without payment
these three characteristic together create a zerosum conception of property
i gain one acre you and everyone else lose one
that just be zerosum in the very same sense as lord bad s appropriation deny the appropriated land to peasant good nice and kind in the enclosure case set out above
thus it be your be exclude in this way from enough land where there be nt unappropriated land for you to acquire which might lead to your suffering physical deprivation
the kind of transfer of property contemplate by hold and barry be base on the realproperty paradigm be zerosum
what logical prerequisite must exist in order to have private property characterize by the realproperty paradigm any property that can be hold in private must be excludable as we see with blackacre above
that is it must be possible to exclude others from its use and enjoyment
indeed public good those thing that be not subject to privatization eg clean air excludability seem to be entail by the very nature of the economic conception of private property
it be also central to the legal conception of private property of course the economist s and the lawyer s notion differ in that the former concern the practical physical ability and therefore the cost to exclude while the latter have to do with the normative power to exclude
as we see above there be a closely relate but distinct characteristic entail by the zerosum conception of property which be often confuse with excludability
if i claim blackacre as my own excludability will insure that no one else can own use or enjoy without suitable permission that particular piece of land viz blackacre
but a conceptually separate thing happen as well as a result of that property claim
the total stock of land available to be use or appropriate be decrease by one acre
this notion be sometimes and barry conflate my deny you blackacre with my deny you one acre lessen the stock available to you by one
that is they treat them as the same thing in the real property paradigm they be the same thing but only within that paradigm
let us see if we can make these condition explicit
spell out formally we may say that the zerosum characteristic of property be define by the exclusion condition ownership of xxp a specific individually identifiable piece of property ie xxp be a name by a imply that all others those not a be exclude from possession and use of xxp without the permission of a the finitude condition there be only xxn thing of type xxp of which xxp be a token in the world where xxn be a practically finite number ie small enough to offer genuine constraint scarcity in the economist s sense
from and we condition a be ownership of xxp imply that there exist only n other thing of xxp s type for all others to own
as one would expect the real property paradigm use these three condition work extremely well for land with no frontier outside the state of nature
indeed the stipulation of no frontier or outside the state of nature just be the introduction of the finitude condition
how well do these three condition work for other sort of property nonrenewable resource be by definition finite in quantity and that make all tangible personal property in some very abstract sense limit
however that finitude often make little difference in divide up the world so to speak
the stock of many though not all nonrenewable resource be indefinitely large far more like land in the frontier case than in the modern nonfrontier case
for even on the frontier there be a knowledge that the total amount of land be ultimately finite technology and human ingenuity generally can multiply the effective quantity of a given resource many time through more efficient use in production process and product design
the market be a enormously effective mechanism for send signal that a given material resource grow more dear
the consequent price increase then drive the aforesaid technology to find replacement or technology which use less
nonetheless there be the thesis hear more often in the s than today that we be fast run through our nonrenewable resource
soon if not now we will find all these resource practically limit
if this be the case then all tangible personal property manufacture from those resource be or soon will be practically limit in amount
for the reason cite above this claim may not be very realistic
nonetheless we shall assume that all tangible personal property be practically limit
this constitute a very strong and i would say highly artificial presumption in favor of hold s and barry s use of locke s proviso argument
thus tangible personal property be subject to the objection that accumulation lead to deprivation ie i can only get more by deny a equal amount to others
the kind of property most important to modern western capitalism however be intangible
the traditional legal distinction between tangible and intangible property be that the former be corporeal and therefore subject to physical dominion while intangible property be incorporeal and abstract
 intangible property include patent copyright trademark commonlaw trade secret and the vastly important domain of financial asset such as stock and bond
now come the central question in this essay be it possible that for certain sort of intangible property the exclusion condition may not entail the zerosum condition and thus the attendant zerosum conception of property hold and barry implicitly answer this question no
indeed to sustain their thesis they must
for they implicitly assume that all type of property outside the state of nature be characterize which we set out above
this they believe necessarily cause the violation of locke s proviso
they reach this conclusion by ignore the possible independence of the finitude condition and thus by conflate the exclusion condition with the zerosum condition 
but what if for certain sort of intangible property the excludability condition be independent of the finitude condition and do not by itself entail the zerosum condition put the question in a different way might there exist intangible property which be at once excludable but inexhaustible in amount if excludable it could be private property ie one could exercise control over it
if inexhaustible it could meet locke s proviso
it would satisfy locke s proviso in that never mind how much some have already there exist enough and as good for all others
in other word i might have a piece of property from which i can exclude you but there be a unlimited amount you need never suffer privation
you merely go appropriate some for yourself
and this would be true regardless of how much i already have appropriate for myself
thus the heldbarry thesis would fail for such a kind of property
the existence of a inexhaustible source of property would have vast moral implication for the justice or injustice of the institution of private property the accumulation of property as wealth and the distribution of that wealth
let us see how this might be so
the patent paradigm
the most obvious if not the most important example of intangible property of this sort be the idea a inventor of my acquaintance hold seventeen patent
these patent be his property every bit as much as my house be mine
true he hold right to them for a term of year and that make his ownership a bit more like a leasehold right
but in all other relevant particulars his patent have the salient earmark of be his property
the most interesting thing i consider it amazing be that he create them ex nihilo
property be create out of nothing but mental labor he do nt even need raw material as the farmer need land and seed or the potter need clay
of course he need a pencil paper a drafting board and a slide rule my friend be a oldfashioned inventor
but these be more like tool
he need no stuff with which to mix his labor
do my friend be patent idea meet the exclusion condition require of all private property yes they do for no one can use his invention without his approval for which he will normally charge a fee a royalty rather than rent but logically identical to one
so exclusion be both practically possible and normatively effective
indeed the machinery of the patent law be create precisely to enable him to exclude others from the appropriation or use of any of a inventor be patent idea
that ownership or use of that idea without his permission
however even in virtue of his exclusion of me from his idea do it make sense to say there be fewer idea out there which i now can think up appropriate by a patent and then use another way of ask this question be do my friend s patent fit the last two part of the zerosum conception of property what about the finitude condition let us assume a simpleminded platonism in which all idea thought of and not yet think of appropriate through the patent law and not yet appropriate exist
to be sure there be seventeen fewer unappropriated idea available for me to appropriate than before my friend start think
but have that lower the stock of unthoughtof and unappropriated idea still to be think up at all certainly not
the number of both notyetthoughtof and notyetappropriated idea be at least practically unbounded if not infinite
it be nt ever xxn and it be nt now xxn constraint
indeed subtract seventeen from the number of all the idea which i could still think up and appropriate do not seem to decrease the total number
this make the arithmetic of idea seem very similar to the arithmetic of aleph zero thus the finitude condition be violate
what about the zerosum condition itself excludability be enough to ensure that i can not appropriate and can not use without permission any presently extant and patent idea
moreover if i do receive a patent on a idea there be one fewer idea out of the finite number already think up and in existence for others to own and use
if we limit ourselves to the presently extant patented appropriated idea they behave exactly like blackacre ie in accord with the realproperty paradigm
however patent idea be not like real property without a frontier just because as we have see there be a source of a infinite or indefinitely large number of new idea which can be think of appropriate ex nihilo merely by hard and creative think
i do not have to pay anyone for those new idea and more importantly when i come up with one the number available to you be not thereby decrease
thus the zerosum condition be not meet
perhaps most important you be not deprive so long as you remain able and willing to exert mental labor
as it be with patent so it be with copyright and trademark
moreover court have decide that a number of other sort of highly abstract thing unbounded in quantity or number be property
one interesting example be a supreme court decision which hold that associated press have a property right in the news it have gathered all of these kind of property share the characteristic that while i can exclude you from the use of mine there be not thereby a small amount upon which you can draw to use or own
moreover as with locke s real property in the with it here the mental labor of thinking to apropriate it
it be otherwise free as it should be if there be a inexhaustible supply presently unclaimed
of course issue of distributive justice implicit in the concern of hold and barry be not thereby solve for not all of us be intelligent enough or intelligent in the right way to think up idea of sufficient novelty and value to be worth protection by patent or copyright
thus we can not all be equal in access to resource
what be even more disturbing for most of us if idea so construe be the only inexhaustible source of wealth produce by labor be that some of us willing to labor might nonetheless have so little as to suffer physical privation
hold and barry might also quite rightly point out that there be substantial transaction cost connect with obtain patent and copyright
theoretically this can be construe as part of the cost of record title rather the cost of perspective however it make very little difference since
such transaction cost do represent a hurdle to the poor
there be no simple answer to the heldbarry challenge
the availability of intellectual property may favor the industrious as locke and the author prefer
but it also favor the intelligent and that be not obviously fair
moreover as intelligence can be magnify by education and as the transaction cost of record title to idea can be high there be some tendency for such property to be more available to the rich or at least the welloff
there be a response however for there be another source of unappropriated property which seem to be even more available to all than intellectual property
ownership in business enterprise
there be no doubt that the notion of the patent or the copyright constitute a different paradigm of property from that of real property in a nonfrontier situation
there also be no doubt that it fit the lockean notion including the proviso far
thus the heldbarry thesis fail with respect to it
yet we assume for the sake of argument only that other kind of tangible property at least in theory fit the real property paradigm better
the number of bulldozer or bicycle or beer bottle be not unbounded in quite the same way as be intellectual property 
certainly patent and copyright be important in our economy but be they more important than all form of tangible property both real and personal no they be not
but ownership share in business enterprise eg common stock in corporation along with many similar kind of property constitute the single most important kind of property interest in our economic system at the very least they constitute the sort of property which capitalism must have in order to be capitalist ie which allow us to accumulate and exchange capital
i wish to claim that the patent paradigm characterize these most important kind of property in modern capitalism far better than the realproperty shall limit our discussion to common stock of corporation although i believe a similar analysis could be make of any financial asset
a ownership interest in a enterprise be abstract and intangible in the way require by the patent paradigm
there be excludability in the sense necessary for all private property
that is there be a finite number of ownership share of corporation presently extant far if i acquire one share of stock my have it deny ownership of that share to any other
thus if i own all the stock of xyz corporation then neither you nor anyone else can own any of it
if i own nine thousand of the ten thousand share outstanding then you can own at most one thousand
but of course the salient feature of the patent paradigm be that even as i exclude you from ownership of xyz corp there be not fewer share of enterprise in general out there for you to own
why not because in a exactly analogous way enterprise through your own effort and thereby create property ex nihilo or you can purchase the share of someone who have do this
""
to see how this be so we have only to trace the evolution of such a enterprise
let us assume that you open a hotdog stand
you use none of your own money instead you rent all of the fixed asset and borrow from a bank to finance the working capital
you be your sole employee
on day one you have zero equity in the business
you have a bit of luck with your location and build a large and faithful clientele
you work hard sell many hot dog
at the end of a year of work you have make a profit of after pay yourself a meager salary
you then plow all the profit back into the business probably by make principal payment on the bank loan or by buy some of the fixed asset
 in the second and third year you make into the business
at the end of three year you have property worth where do this property come from from your original idea your effort and your entrepreneurial activity as much as the idea cover by the patent come from my friend s head
moreover your in property do not nor do it lower the stock of the total worth of enterprise out there to be build by others or the value of any other property they may hold
from here one can take the story in a variety of direction
our entrepreneur might sell his business and then hold in cash or passive investment
he might expand and soon have a business worth 
whatever the denouement we have see that hold and barry be wrong for this case
more property for our enterepreneur do not mean less for anyone else
he have gain and no one have lose
his great stake of property have come from some source which if we have not yet and do not obviously detract from opportunity others might have for obtain more property
it be not zerosum in character
but how do this creation of intangible property work do it really bring such property within the ambit of locke s proviso let us see
a extremely simplify and somewhat simplistic version of the contemporary microeconomic account of how this creation of value occur might run something like this
we assume you do nt misrepresent your product or defraud your customer by use cheap filler for example
thus each time you sell a hotdog you make a customer better off to the extent that their use value for the hotdog be high than or at the limit at least as high as the exchange value you set on it the price
so long as you keep answering need or want for hotdog at a low price than what people use value for hotdog be but that remain high than your cost you be make this account may seem to describe a mysterious process but a moment s reflection will show that it do not
it do however require a commitment to a subjective theory of value if i value something you have more than something i have and you attribute reciprocal value to the two thing the potential for a trade exist in which we be both better off and no one else be bad off thus create a pareto improvement
the exchange of one hotdog with one customer at a price both you the hotdog entrepreneur and she the customer find acceptable be just such a transaction
such transaction be the paradigm market phenomenon of modern microeconomics 
profit then occur when the entrepreneurproducer take his share of the gain from trade his part of the pareto improvement
as he accumulate these gain he measure profit in his business
wealth in the form of intangible property the ownership of a company be just the accumulated profit
indeed modern worth of this company with its earned surplus or retain earnings
""
conclusion
business profit and business growth be or can be if business be transact ethically value create which as share of business enterprise mean property creating we have a inexhaustible frontier from which we can continue to appropriate such property without deny anything to our fellow human being
indeed the accumulation of wealth in this manner can and should be a paretoimproving process in that it make some better off while make no one bad off
as regards the most important kind of property in a capitalist economic system locke s proviso be completely satisfied
contrary to the heldbarry thesis nowhere do the accumulation of this kind of property by some necessarily require less property for others
james w child
bowl green state university
a central theme in recent liberal argument for the freemarket have be a epistemological one
it be claim that the free market be a solution to problem of ignorance and that there be necessary limitation to the knowledge that any particular individual or subset of individual in society can possess
hence there be limitation to the knowledge at the disposal of any central planning board in a planned economy
the economic liberal argue that in contrast to these limitation of centralized planned economy the market overcome the problem of human ignorance
there be two source of these limitation to human knowledge that be particularly prominent in the work of economic liberal
the first be what hayek call the division of knowledge in society that is the dispersal of knowledge and skill throughout different individual in society much of such knowledge take the form of practical knowledge knowledge how rather than knowledge that which can not be articulate in propositional form
hence such knowledge can not in principle be pass on disperse throughout society of which any particular individual or subset of individual will be ignorant
a second source of ignorance be the unpredictability of human need and want
this be in part a consequence of the fact that a individual s need and want often can not be articulate
however it also have another basis
need and want change with the invention and production of new object for consumption
to quote a version of this point from a writer who be not a economic liberal
production not only provide the material to satisfy a need but it also provide the need for the material the need feel for the object be induce by the perception of the object
a objet dart create a public that have artistic taste and be able to enjoy beauty and the same can be say of any other product 
if one also accept popper s claim that the progress of human knowledge be in principle unpredictable if we could predict future knowledge we would already have it then it knowledge and want and need be create by human invention then human want and need be also in principle unpredictable
hence at any point in time we be ignorant about the full range of future human need and want
we have then two source of ignorance
the economic liberal claim that the market be a solution to the problem present by this ignorance
with respect to the first source of ignorance division of knowledge the problem be that of communicate between different actor that knowledge which be relevant to the coordination of their action
its solution require a mechanism which will convey to each agent the information he must possess in order to adjust effectively his decision to those of others
 the price system provide such a mechanism
by serve as a numerical index of change in the relation between the supply and demand for good it communicate between independent actor the information that be relevant to the coordination of their activity
it do so while allow each individual to make best with respect to the second source of ignorance the unpredictability of human want and need the problem be that of have a discovery procedure for uncover what such need and want will be
market competition between business be present as such a discovery procedure just as conjecture about the physical world be test and falsify by experiment so conjecture about future human need and want be test and falsify by competition in the marketplace
the business of those who conjecture wrongly about future need and want fail others pass the test although it be possible that at some future date they in turn will find their conjecture falsify in the market
competition between business in the market prallels competition between conjecture in the science business be realization of economic conjecture
such parallel between competition in market and in the science have be develop far in way which i will discuss later in the paper
the economic liberal claim then that the market solve the problem of human ignorance
in consequence the it possible for a planning body to possess all relevant economic information
two critical point one might make of this defense of the market be central to this paper
the first concern the assumption at the base of the argument that there exist only two way of distribute information in society either through a decentralized market mechanism or through a centralized planning agency
the strength of the epistemological argument for the market depend in part on the implausibility of assume that all knowledge could be centralize upon some particular planning agency
the argument ignore however the existence of the decentralized but predominantly nonmarket institution for the distribution of knowledge and information notably the profession in particular the institution of the scientific community
the contrast between market institution and the institution of the scientific community will be the focus of this paper
the second critical point which be particularly relevant in this regard be that the epistemological defense of the market tend to ignore the way in which the market itself be a source of the problem of ignorance market system there be a disincentive to communicate information between actor who be in competition
put simply if producer a and b be in competition and a inform b of his or her activity and b do not reciprocate then b be in a position to adjust his or her behavior in order to compete more effectively than a in this situation standard game theory apply
while cooperation through mutual communication might be beneficial to both party if one cooperate and the others do not the noncooperating party benefit
given that both party be selfinterested the rational strategy be to act noncooperatively
noncommunication be a competitively stable strategy one sphere in which such noncommunication between competitor be prevalent in the market be that of scientific and technical knowledge
competitor in the market as rational actor actively keep novel scientific and technical work nonpublic
a feature of the market be the existence of a incentive to secrecy and confidentiality in technical information
this feature of the market lead to major conflict where the that associate with the scientific and academic community
the increasing encroachment of market relation into the scientific community have lead to a conflict between the proprietary secrecy of the market and the open communication of traditional science
as nelkin note
conflict of interest be bind to arise in situation in which university faculty be directly involved in commercial venture
the academic responsibility of open communication inevitably conflict with the commercial responsibility to maintain proprietary secrecy 
the detail of such conflict be to be find elsewhere and i will not discuss them in this paper my central concern rather will be with the normative question what be wrong if anything with the employment of market mechanism in the scientific sphere to what extent if at all should the market play a role in the activity of scientific research and the distribution of the result of such research i will approach these question by focus on the difference and possible conflict between the kind of property system presuppose by paper be compose of two section
in the first i undertake some necessary preliminary clarification of different sense in which one can talk of intellectual property the sense in which this be presuppose in the context of the market and the sense in which it be presuppose in modern professional science
in do so i point out some of the confusion in the literature on science study that arise from mix these different sense of intellectual property
the analysis in this section take as its starting point a dispute in the sixteenth century between tartaglia and cardano which highlight the difference and conflict between these distinct system of intellectual property in a particularly vivid way
this example rather than a example of a modern conflict also have other advantage as a starting point for discussion
in particular it enable us to concentrate on the question of the appropriateness of market relation to science and to avoid a added complexity that arise in the modern context ie that scientist in commercial science the result of their research belong not to themselves but to the corporation that employ them
this feature of the modern situation add a far dimension to the normative problem of the involvement of market in science concerning a individual s alienation of right to the fruit of his or her labor
this issue be a important one but be not one i shall pursue here my sixteenthcentury example lack this added complication
as a initial example it allow us to focus on the issue of what if anything be inappropriate in the market as a institutional framework for science in the second section i turn to this central issue of the paper whether market mechanism be appropriate in the scientific domain
i
to understand the dispute between tartaglia and cardano require a examination of the social and economic context of their work
both mathematician belong to the tradition of cossist algebra predominant in italy and germany in the sixteenth century
this algebraic tradition be closely link with the rise of mercantile capitalism and the new textbook produce in the cossist tradition employ predominantly mercantile example and often also include detailed economic information alongside the mathematics
moreover mathematician like tartaglia earn a income from the employment of mathematical skill on behalf of merchant
in this context publication of mathematical result often serve as a form of advertisement for mathematical skill
another important form of publicity come from competition in which mathematician would set each other problem often with a side bet on the winner
success in such competition required novelty in algorithm for the solution of mathematical problem
the origin of the dispute between tartaglia and cardano lay in one such competition
tartaglia have develop a algorithm for solve cubic equation a algorithm which have be develop early by ferro who have keep the solution a secret to himself and a few student
one of these student fior who have use the algorithm to win a series of mathematical competition challenge tartaglia to a contest and lose
on hearing of the contest cardano seek out tartaglia and according to tartaglia at least he be swear to secrecy
however on find that the solution have be discover by ferro cardano publish tartaglia s solution in ars magna cite ferro and tartaglia as independent inventor of the algorithm
despite this citation cardano s publication produce a heated response from tartaglia and a major dispute between cardano and tartaglia 
this dispute be significant in that it reveal a contrast in the notion of intellectual property between that predominant within the cossist tradition and that which have develop in science in the succeeding century
a comment by mahoney on the dispute be to the point here
to the modern scholar imbue with the notion that as xxr k merton have put it a idea be not really yours until you give it away ie through publication tartaglia s attitude seem strange
yet in sixteenthcentury italy where mathematics be a competitive business among the cossists the attitude be more than reasonable 
implicit in the dispute view of intellectual property the first illustrate by tartaglia ferro and others in the cossist tradition be one associate with the market
property here involve as macpherson put it a individual right to exclude others from the use or benefit of something and relatedly the right of individual to transfer some or all of these right to other individual
while these right be not legally enforceable there be clearly a assumption on the part of cossists like tartaglia that they do involve ethical claim on others
tartaglia s attitude to his algorithm be that it be in a real sense his and that he have a right to circumscribe the use which cardano make of it
more generally it lay at the base of the secrecy that be prevalent in cossist algebra
mathematics be as mahoney put it a competitive business
the second view of intellectual property be the paradoxical mertonian concept mention by mahoney a idea be not yours until you of intellectual property in science
as a piece of property the research report be a rather unusual object
the property come into existence only by be make available for use by others 
on this mertonian view then one make a claim to intellectual property by make public a independently develop original result
a result that be unpublished be not recognize as yours
give this view of intellectual property what count as publication become of central importance and significant for this be the growth of the scientific journal as a primary vehicle for publication particularly in the early nineteenth century and the kind of editorial and peerreviewing process associate with it it be through publication in journal or book form that one lay a claim to property right over a theory or result
it might be object here that there be something problematic in talk of property right at all
when one talk of property it normally imply right to use or benefit from a thing ethical force
give this conception of property the publication of scientific result make them public or common property the benefit and use of the theory become the right of anyone within the limit of plagiarism and copyright
einstein s theory of relativity be not the property of any particular individual
it be common property indeed merton also refer in this regard to the communism of science
the substantive finding of science be a product of social collaboration and be assign to the community
they constitute a common heritage in which the equity of the individual producer be severely limit
a eponymous law or theory do not enter into the exclusive possession of the discoverer and his heir nor do the muse bestow upon him special right of use and disposition 
what sense then be there in talk of a individual claim intellectual property through the act of publication in a minimum sense it might be note that we use the possessive in refer to theory einstein s theory of relativity
however this in itself can not be say to be a basis for talk of property
we can also talk for example of einstein s haircut without thereby indicate any property relation
if talk of property be to make sense there must be some sense in which the producer of the theory gain certain right or power in virtue of the act of publication
the right which merton and ravetz be concerned with in their discussion of intellectual property be right of recognition most notably through citation and in some case eponymy and right to the benefit that accrue from such recognition
thus merton continue the quotation above as follow
property right in science be whittle down to a bare minimum by the rationale of the scientific ethic
the scientist s claim to his intellectual property be limit to the recognition and esteem which if the institution function with a modicum of efficiency be roughly commensurate with the significance of the increment bring to the common fund of such recognition
yet this intellectual property be none the less real and important to those who possess it
as a verification of the scientist s accomplishment it can bring immediate reward
and as a implicit guarantee of the quality of his future work it bring in interest for some time after its publication 
however i remain uneasy about the way such talk of the right to recognition and benefit which a producer attain through publication of a theory be cash out in terms of property right over the theory
it would seem more appropriate here to talk simply of publication make a theory common property and refer merely to right to recognition on the side of the producer
the metaphor of the producer s intellectual property be not in itself a problem as long as it be clear what be be say
however problem do arise when the reference to such propertyrights be develop in way appropriate to its more normal use as private property
thus for example later discussion of the nature of intellectual property in science
thus he go on to argue that citation in addition to other function represent a payment for use of the material
 the picture here be that of property in the sense in which it be involve within the market in which a individual with exclusive right to something alienate these property right in exchange for certain payment from those to whom use of the theory be grant
indeed ravetz even go on to talk of imagine a ideal social contract between producer and user of theory
the metaphor however be inappropriate
if one accept the mertonian model of intellectual property as result from the publication of a theory a individual do not thereby alienate property right to the theory on the contrary it be only through the act of publication that it be recognize as that individual s
moreover as a functional explanation of citation ravetz s payment model be implausible there be after all nothing hagstrom s view that academic publication be a instance of giftgiving the concept of giftgiving like that of market exchange assume a model of property as imply exclusive use of a object
the difference between market exchange and giftgiving be that property right be alienate to others in the absence of any contractual expectation of repayment by others
there will of course be other kind of expectation of reciprocal action but failure of such repayment in the case of gift represent not failure of contract but rather indicate that the personal bond between giver and receiver be not in order hence concept such as personal slight become appropriate where reciprocal action be absent
the problem with the property metaphor then be that it can result in import into the sphere of public science concept of property which be inappropriate
we have then two distinct possible concept of property in science
first a concept of property appropriate to the market which indeed be find that which be find in professional science in which theory be common property but where the publication of theory by the producer issue in right of recognition and the benefit of recognition
these two conception of property be incompatible in way illustrate by the tartagliacardano dispute
as merton again put it the communism of the scientific ethos be incompatible with definition of technology as private property in a capitalist economy
 ii
the problem discuss in the previous section concerning the use in the study of science of concept of property appropriate to the market be theoretical they lead to inadequate descriptive and explanatory model of scientific activity
in this section i turn to the normative question which be central to this paper what if anything be wrong with the employment of market mechanism in science be there any reason to suppose that the kind of professional public science that have develop since the sixteenth century should be prefer to the kind of market mechanism that we find for example in the cossist within private firm
there be two kind of objection that might be raise against the employment of market mechanism in the knowledge industry
first there be those which claim that there be condition a item must meet to be the sort of thing that can be a commodity and that scientific theory and information do not meet these necessary condition
second there be those which claim that the kind of property relation appropriate to the market necessarily conflict with good scientific practice
in the following i will argue that the first set of objection fail
i then develop and defend some version of the second
""
the first group of objection which be to be find in the economics literature highlight feature of theory and information that appear to entail that they can not be commodities the first and most significant of these be that they can not be alienate one can not it might be argue sell a theory a proof a piece of information and the fruit or a car after the transaction the seller retain the capacity to use and benefit from the good in question
this objection however be premise on a misunderstanding of what it be to alienate property it presuppose a mistaken view of property as a thing and not as a set of rights clearly it be not possible literally to transfer a theory in a act of exchange in the same way one can if one sell a car or a bag of apple
however to alienate property be not to alienate a object as such but to alienate a set of right and capacity to use and benefit from a object this be as possible in the case of information and knowledge as it be in the case of commodity such as car and apple
indeed the sale of education and training facility by firm and government provide a good example of how theoretical and practical knowledge be already partially realize as a commodity
a second difficulty that be claim for information as a commodity have access to it
thus for example arrow write
there be a fundamental paradox in the determination of demand for information its value for the producer be not know until he have the information but then he have in effect acquire it without cost 
this problem i believe be overdrawn
it be not necessary to know the content of a theory or item of information in order to be able to assess its probable market value
its potential market value to a purchaser can be measure in terms of behavioral capacity ie in what it enable a individual to do
indeed it be precisely this point that be part of the rationale for competition in the cossist tradition
moreover it be true of most commodity that their quality can only be fully appreciate in the process of consumption
there be nothing then that be peculiar to theory and information in themselves that make them inappropriate item for the market if there be a problem with the use of market and information be inappropriate for the market but that the market be inappropriate for the practice of science
""
the second group of objection concern the way in which the property relation appropriate to the market undermine good scientific practice
i will develop three of these that market mechanism be incompatible with the open communication in science which be a necessary condition for the growth of knowledge that the market as a institutional framework for science disassociate the external reward assign to a contributor to science from the value of his or her contribution to the development of science that private property in science undermine a commitment to the practice of science
i will begin however by consider a case for the defender of the opposing view that far from
be inappropriate as a institutional framework for science the market have all the feature that will make for the best development of science
a good starting point for such a case be the parallel which the the market which i outline at the start of this paper
market mechanism be appropriate to science since they encourage competition between different research group
science like business be at its best a competitive enterprise
the virtue of competition in both sphere be that it encourage innovation
the proper argument for competition in science as in business as a mean of improving knowledge be that it promote alternative conjecture and their critical examination 
indeed it might be note that my early example support this point
cossist algebra be important in the development of mathematics
where mathematics in the university of the period be moribund the competitive pressure of commerce encourage a novelty in algorithm of which tartaglia s work be a notable example
a similar kind of argument might be make for commercial science
for example research work in the pharmaceutical and electronic industry hardly suggest that market competition be a brake on the growth of knowledge
one might argue then that give the competitive nature to it as a institutional framework
a initial point that must be make about this argument be that the reference to recent example of marketbased research just note be unsatisfactory
innovative research in the market sector have take place against the background of a domain of public knowledge
the science have operate within a mixed economy basic scientific research have be carry out within the public professional domain commercial research have be parasitic on this public domain
the problem which be increasingly a practical as well as a theoretical one be whether public science be a necessary condition for scientific development or whether it be possible for all science to take place within a market economy
as nelkin note of new liaison between professional science and commercial enterprise
academic science have be a public resource a repository for idea and a source of relatively unbiased information
industrial connection blur the distinction between corporation and the university establish private control over a public resource
problem of secrecy and proprietary right be inherent in these new the public interest 
this raise the first and central objection to the market as a institutional framework for science touch on at the beginning of this paper
there be in a competitive market economy a disincentive to communicate information
the market encourage secrecy which be inimical to openness in science it presuppose a view of property in which the owner have right to exclude others
in the sphere of science such right of exclusion place limit on the communication of information and theory which be incompatible with the growth of knowledge
thus for example the most obvious defect of the competitive nature of cossist algebra be the kind of secrecy exhibit by tartaglia and ferro which inhibit the spread of the result to other scholar in a position to contribute to their development
it be partially for this reason that tartaglia s response to cardano appear unreasonable to modern who be sympathetic to a norm in which theory be publish and thereby become public property
the development of scientific knowledge depend upon the publication that science tend to grow when communication be open
rather there be a necessary connection between publication and the growth of knowledge
a necessary condition for the acceptability of a theory or experimental result be that it pass the public critical scrutiny of competent scientific judges a private theory or result be one that be shield from the criteria of scientific acceptability
since the judgment of competent peer be a necessary condition for the acceptability of a scientific result the publication of scientific work for the judgment of the scientific community be a necessary condition for its be a contribution to the growth of knowledge at all
open communication for this reason be a essential condition for the scientific enterprise
this be not to say that secrecy or nondisclosure of result be absent from the scientific community
individual and research team do not keep rival inform at each stage of their progress
science be a competitive enterprise
however the pressure for nondisclosure in science be for nondisclosure of premature work
it remain a essential condition for in the public domain
competition in science be competition between individual and group to be first to place before the community a result which will be able to withstnd the critical scrutiny of competent judge
where such a appraisal be successful one can claim right to appropriate recognition
the defender of the market as a institution appropriate for science might respond at this point that my argument fail to note a way in which the market itself can provide a public test for conjecture which be quite akin to that in science
consider the following parallel between the scientific community and the marketplace draw by loasby
after note the point that i have just make that in science we have to rely on intersubjective criteria for appraise theory he write
that should not be a disturbing proposition to economist use to invoke intersubjective judgement of value in the market result from the appraisal and decision of competent wellinformed economic agent
the parallel go far
scientist seek to advance knowledge but can do so their fellow and to comparison with other new idea from other scientist just as entrepreneur seek to better existing offering must expose themselves to the appraisal of customer and supplier and to the risk of be surpass by competitor offers 
loasby here be only point to parallel between scientific and market competition he be not suggest that the market be a appropriate institutional framework for science
but it be open to the defender of the market in science to exploit the parallel
what would be wrong with use the market itself as a public test of the acceptability of theory theory and result that fail to pass the appraisal and decision of wellinformed competent economic agent would fail as they do when subject to the scrutiny of the scientific community
in a free market in knowledge good idea force out bad
this defense of the appropriateness of a market framework for science can not be sustain
the market provide the wrong kind of public test of scientific knowledge
it do so the market provide the wrong kind of community of evaluator for theory
by this i mean something more than that the community of evaluator would include others apart from scientist
there be something wrong with the very parallel that loasby draw between science and the market for loasby as the value of a scientific theory be determine by judgment of competent wellinformed scientist so value in the marketplace be determine by the judgment of competent wellinformed economic agent
however the appeal to competent wellinformed economic agent be disingenuous
the market be in one sense a egalitarian institution any individual s preference count in determine the market value of a good provided it be back with cash
any particular property of a individual s personal skill capacity and competence be irrelevant to whether his or her judgment count
the only property that count be their capacity to pay
inform and uninformed judgment all count equally
market value be not determine by the appraisal but by the appraisal and decision of economic agent per se incompetent as well as competent uninformed as well as informed
science in contrast be inegalitarian in this sense
only certain judgment count
the appraisal of the value of scientific work do require competent and inform judge
the judgment of those without the requisite competence be irrelevant
the market do not provide the right kind of community of evaluator for scientific work 
neither do the market provide the right kind of criteria for evaluation of scientific work
the value a theory have to the development of scientific knowledge be not appropriately relate to its market value
the market value of information and theory be instrumental it be a measure of their immediate usefulness in the service of commerce technology or even as be the case in the cossist tradition in gain publicity for one s marketable skill through victory in competition
such usefulness be only contingently relate to the significance of a theory to the internal development of the science for which simplicity and the like be the appropriate criteria of judgment
relatedly market will value theory that have immediate to nearfuture implication theory and information of more significance to the internal development of science have implication over a long time scale
it be such reason that be at the basis of the observation that market favor research with immediate application and disfavor research of a more fundamental kind
this last point raise the second objection to the market as a institution appropriate to science give the employment of market mechanism the value of a contribution to the development of science be disassociate from the external reward that the institution that support science assign to the contributor
because the market value of information and theory be instrumental and be at best only indirectly relate to the significance a theory have to the internal development of science its reward to the contributor to science be not properly relate to the significance of the contribution
in contrast the process of assign recognition develop by professional science such as peer review be not perfect be at least of the right kind to ensure that the contribution to the internal development of science be match by external reward appropriate recognition and its related benefit
this problem can be state usefully in terms of alasclair macintyre s distinction between practice and institution the practice of science be characterize in terms of its internal good ie those good which can not be identify without reference to the kind of activity it be
the institution of science be concerned with the distribution of external good ie good such as material wealth power and recognition which can be identify independently of any particular activity
in thesystem of property
in science that have emerge over the last three century the institution of science be of the right kind to support the practice of science whereas the system of property distribution associate with the market be not
this distinction of macintyre be between internal and external good raise a third possible objection to the introduction of market mechanism and its related property science be incompatible as such with a commitment to the internal good of science
the exclusivity of property right of market good be incompatible with a commitment to such internal good to exclude other individual from the use of a theory who be commit and able to contribute to the far development of a practice be thereby to indicate a failure of commitment to the development of the practice itself
thus ferro and tartaglia in keep secret their algorithm reveal by their behavior that the goal of the development of algebra be subordinate to goal of a exclusively competitive kind the communism of science highlight by merton be a particular case of a communism implicit in all wellordered human practice
the use of property relation of the marketplace in science be incompatible with a commitment to the internal good of science
theory and information be not the kind of item to which exclusive property right be appropriate give a view of science as a autonomous practice with its own internal good
hence to bring the market into
however this objection as it stand be open to the following rejoinder
the argument above confuse a individual have the right to exclude others from a theory with a individual s exercise of that right
while it be the case that a individual be exclude others from a contribution to science do show a failure in his or her commitment to that practice the use of the system of private property involved in the market be in itself neutral
it be open to the individual to exhibit his or her commitment to the practice of science by waive the exercise of the right of exclusion
this response be i believe a strong one although within a market economy each individual be force to exercise at least some of his or her right of exclusion
let us concede that the third objection fail as state
however its central point can be restate thus give a introduction of market property relation into science the act of publish without some form of payment individual who so act become the selfsacrificing giftgiving altruist find in hagstrom s idealized model of the scientific community
what the market will have effect be a institutional redefinition of a individual s selfinterest which narrow its range
whereas in existing scientific institution to publish one s result be to act in a selfinterested way the market redefine this as a act against one s own interest
hence given that the scientific community be not a community of rationalist saint the market undermine a commitment to the internal goal of science
the main point here be a aristotelian one for aristotle the correct response to the egoist who ask question such as why have friend or why act virtuously be that the egoist have a narrow conception of what his or her good be
the egoist assume a narrow range of good the big share of money honor and bodily pleasure and ask how friend or virtue bring these good
one should respond not by try to show friendship and virtue but by point out that the egoist have misidentify what the good of life are this basic aristotelian point however need a sociologial dimension for it be the institution themselves that define what count as one be interests in particular the market encourage egoism not primarily because it encourage a individual to be selfinterested it would be unrealistic not to expect individual to act for the great part in a selfinterested manner but rather because it define a individual s interest in a particularly narrow fashion most notably in terms of the possession of certain material good
in consequence where market mechanism enter a particularsphere of life the pursuit of good outside this narrow range of market good be institutionally define as a act of altruism
for this reason the market undermine the pursuit of the internal good of practice like those of science
john oneill
university of sussex brighton england
a favorite topic in academic political philosophy in the last third of the twentieth century have be the shortcoming of the economic system under which most of us live
though in recent year there have be some recognition of the advantage of the market and the difficulty with alternative economic system this have not slow the steady stream of criticism of this or that aspect of the free enterprise system
the purpose of this essay be to give a account of the geography of various criticism of this system and to argue that most of those in the current philosophical literature suffer from a common drawback or defect of real importance
toward the end of this essay i shall offer some positive suggestion about how critic might repair this defect
first a analytical question
what be mean by the term the free enterprise system this term be systematically ambiguous
we can think of it as describe actually existing economic system or as describe some kind of ideal type that realworld economic system only approximate
include the economic system of western europe north america and part of the pacific rim
in these system though there be state monopoly in certain industry eg education utility communication and the state try to influence the economy in various way most production do not take place in stateowned firm and the state do not undertake or otherwise direct most new investment
in this sense a free enterprise system be any system in which most of the mean of production be privately own and the state do not determine most investment
on the other hand the term free enterprise system be sometimes use to refer to something more abstract
theoretical discussion by critic and defender of the free enterprise system often seem to be about the economic system of a hypothetical libertarian society with a nightwatchman state
in such a system all mean of production be privately own and there be no attempt at state direction of the economy
the state s role be strictly limit to enforce no need to resolve this ambiguity about the term free enterprise system for the purpose of this essay
however this term be understand systematic criticism of the free enterprise system be either explicitly or implicitly criticism of the privateproperty right that constitute the framework of that system
these right can be understand as the positive legal right that constitute actually existing economic system but only insofar as these right resemble those that would be find in the hypothetical libertarian society allude to above
let us begin with a taxonomy of these criticism
the main function of any economic system be to produce and distribute exchangeable good and service
one important kind of complaint against the free enterprise system be that it do not do a very good job at this that is the system be inherently dysfunctional with respect to some range of good or service
the basic idea behind criticism of this sort be that the system be not produce or distribute the relevant good or service as efficiently as it could be
these efficiency come from a variety of source
welfare economist often charge the freeenterprise system with market failure
market failure be defect of the free enterprise system associate with externality or public good
externalitites be positive or negative effect of voluntary transaction on noncontracting third party
the benefit from a vaccination program and the harm associate with industrial pollution be often cite as example of positive and negative externality respectively
the usual charge be that the free enterprise system overproduce good associate with negative externality and underproduces good associate with positive externality
for example production of a consumer good that pollute the atmosphere be at a high level than it would be if the manufacturer or the consumer have to compensate those who suffer from the pollution
overproduction in this case be overproduction relative to what would take place in a ideal market system
similarly for underproduction of good associate with positive externality
a ideal market system be define in terms of some very strong assumption about perfect information welldefined property right no monopoly there be no uncompensated externality in this model of a economy
in orthodox welfare economics a ideal market system serve as a kind of benchmark against which realworld system be judge
the reason for this be that it be a theorem of welfare economics that a ideal market system achieve a pareto optimal allocation of resource producer and consumer good this be a distribution in which no one can be make better off without someone else be make bad off
the main policy implication of this theorem according to orthodox thinking anyway be that realworld economic system should be make more like a ideal market system to the extent that this feasible since this would result in distribution of good and service more closely approximate pareto optimality
for example if the state prohibit pollution above a certain level this directly or indirectly lower production of the good in question this low production be closer to the level of production that would occur in a ideal market system
this mean that production be have achieve pareto optimality
for this reason a change in the system of property right that result in movement toward a pareto optimal allocation of good and service be think to represent a efficiency gain for the system
a similar strategy be employ with public good problem
public good be define in terms of nonexcludability or jointness of supply and nonrivalrous consumption
in other word a public good be something nonpayers can not be feasibly exclude from consume and consumption by one person do not diminish the quantity of the good available to others
commonly cite example of public good include lighthouse and national defense
it be claim that public good like good associate with positive externality tend to be underproduced in a free enterprise system because roughly of excludability problem
as in the case of negative externalitites the solution to public good problem be seek in governmental action
the state provide the good in question and force everyone to contribute in virtue of the fact that the good be pay in theory free enterprise system be inherently dysfunctional insofar as they suffer market failure that is problem associate with negative and positive externality and public good problem
these failure be explain by reference to the system of property right in the mean of production characteristic of the free enterprise system
in the real world however market failure be mitigate by governmental action which be as it should be according to these critic of the free enterprise system
the state provide some public good such as national defense and it reduce negative externality by for example regulate pollution
nevertheless some negative externality remain and not all public good problem be solve
but perfection be not to be expect
amelioration be however and that be what governmental action be supposed to deliver
charge of market failure constitute one important type of efficiency criticism of the free enterprise system
two other type of efficiency criticism be worth mention
one concern inefficiency associate with monopolistic of oligopolistic pricing
the charge be price be high and production level be low than they would be in a ideal market system which by definition have many supplier or producer for any given product perfect competition
this market imperfection be supposed to be cure by antitrust policy or by direct governmental regulation of price or both
the cure may not be complete but it be better than the disease at least according to these critic of the free enterprise system
a final type of efficiency criticism be that the free enterprise system have certain inherent macrolevel instability which be make manifest in the business cycle
keynesian for example maintain that the free enterprise system can and have suffer persistent and chronic unemployment of human resource because of insufficient aggregate demand
as in the case of other efficiency criticism state action eg through fiscal or monetary policy be advocate to correct these perceived defect of the free enterprise system
these efficiency criticism have provide a theoretical justification for much if not most century
what all these criticism have in common be a charge that the free enterprise system a system of private property right in the mean of production be inherently dysfunctional in one way or another
the remedy for the problem thus identify be always state action
state action can take the form of a government program which be supposed to deal with the problem at hand or it can involve a more direct truncation or abrogation of private property right or both
the thinking be that if government can change the rule of the free enterprise system or otherwise intervene so that the system s distribution of good and service more closely approximate pareto optimality it should do so
after all it be the rational thing to do on the collective level
of course some of this justification for state intervention be after the fact
antitrust legislation for example do not await midtwentieth century development in welfare economics
nevertheless much government regulation and intervention in the free enterprise system have be advocate the system have some inherently dysfunctional feature which can be correct or ameliorate by governmental action that in some way restrict private property right
radical criticism of the free enterprise system have for the most part follow the same general line
according to radical criticism the free enterprise system the capitalist system be severely dysfunctional
it be so inept at do what any economic system be supposed to do namely meet people s want and need for exchangeable good and service that it ought to be fundamentally alter
the language of crisis pervade radical criticism a language that seem more or less plausible at different time
radical and moderate differ in their respective judgment about the seriousness of the problem in question and about the appropriateness of different response
moderate believe that the inefficiency of the free enterprise system be significant but not catastrophic they further maintain that institutional tinkering can noticeably improve efficiency
by contrast radical be inclined to believe that the situation be so bad that only major institutional surgery can suggestion about who the surgeon should be
the literature detail all of these efficiency criticism have not go unchallenged commonly voice objection to the criticism pertaining to public good and externality include the following the socalled public good in question be not really public good that is they can be privatize by redefine or simply enforce property right the provision of public good can be tie to private good which be excludable externality can be internalize by a proper redefinition of private property right or even the enforcement of already existing right
implicitly or explicitly these criticism make the point that the unfettered market be more resourceful and more efficient that its critic believe
in a similar vein efficiency criticism about monopolistic pricing and the instability of the business cycle have be challenge by austrian and neoaustrian economist who argue that state intervention not market force be primarily responsible for both of these problems leave to its own device the free enterprise system would not face problem of monopoly pricing not to the extent that it do when the government intervene
what all these objection to the criticism outline above have in common be the idea that the free enterprise system can meet the challenge the critic pose without the government restrict or abrogate private property right
to the extent that these argument succeed they show that the free enterprise system be not inherently dysfunctional in the way that critic charge
only the most rigid and uncompromising defender of the free enterprise system deny the justice of any and all of the efficiency criticism that have be level over the past century or so
however a different kind of response to these criticism have emerge over the past twentyfive year in the writing of the socalled publicchoice school among others central to their countercritique be the idea that the critic can not simply assume that government or more exactly government official have as their sole or even primary aim the promotion of the public good when they intervene in the economy
critic of the free enterprise system government intervene to correct for some market failure
in a more positive vein these thinker argue that the same assumption and technique use by standard economics to analyze and understand decisionmaking in the private sphere can be use to analyze and understand decisionmaking in the public sphere and that the application of these method do not support the critic prescription about what ought to be do
this mean that market inefficiency do not necessarily get corrected indeed they can get bad when the solution to some efficiency criticism be seek in governmental action and the restriction of private property right this entail
put another way this extension of standard technique of economic analysis into the public sphere have result in the discovery that public ie governmental decisionmaking have inefficiency peculiar to itself
in short there be government failure as well as market failure
all this imply that it be not enough to show that the market fail in some way or other and that in theory the state could correct show that public institution or decisionmaking through public institution would produce a better result from the point of view of efficiency than would the market and the private property right that constitute it
absent a account of alternative and how they would bring about the desired result efficiency criticism of the free enterprise system remain incomplete and suggestive at best and misleading academic exercise at bad
they be incomplete without a adequate account of alternative and how such alternative would work they be misleading academic exercise to the extent that they lead people including people with political power to believe there be governmental solution to what may be effectively unsolvable problem
for the purpose of this essay the most important feature of the public choice countercritique as well as the other objection mention above be that they all focus the issue between the defender and the critic of the free enterprise system so clearly which set of institutional arrangement best achieve a certain agreedupon goal eg avoid or reduce unemployment provide public good with externality or monopoly indeed it be not necessary to accept all of austrian economics or public choice theory to recognize that the real issue on these efficiency question be a choice of which alternative institutional arrangement can best solve a given problem
this issue reduce to the question of how property right ought to be distribute across private and public actor to best achieve a certain result
despite the award of the nobel prize for economics in to james buchanan one of the founder of the public choice movement it be hard to say how widely this insight have be recognize among economist
much of economics in general and welfare economics in particular continue to consist in abstract mathematical modelbuilding and theoremproving there be correspondingly little attention pay to the really difficult question of what any of this tell us about how realworld economic system ought to be structure
although most mathematically inclined welfare economist have be reluctant to move precipitously or even at all from the identification of a certain defect to particular recommendation about how to correct the problem this have not prevent their work from be appropriate by those who do have a political agenda to advance
in addition economist who say yes there be a real problem here but there may be nothing that government official can do that would nt make matter bad tend not to get consulting contract or high visibility
economist criticism of the free enterprise system can almost always be conceive of as efficiency criticism of one sort or another
in evaluate economic system economist generally take end as give and debate the issue of mean
the reason for this be various
sometimes they seem to believe that question about end can not be rationally debate or less charitably they have not be teach how to carry on such debate
sometimes they appeal to democratic and individualistic ideal according to which each individual s value be as important as any others s
on this way of thinking the only question worth debating mean for achieve already give end
by contrast philosophical criticism of the free enterprise system tend to go beyond or behind this meansends nexus
this type of criticism often start with some intuitive value judgment or moral judgment unfavorable to life in contemporary society
the objectionable state of affair be trace to the free enterprise system or more exactly the private property right that define that system
a common type of criticism concern the scope of market exchange
the basic idea be that while the market may be a perfectly acceptable institutional framework for produce and distribute some good and service there be others that be currently produce and distribute in this way for which it be not
for example it have be argue that housing and workplace health and safety be not properly speak commodities a similar view about human organ be widespread in the medical ethics community
the general idea be that there be something about the character of each of these thing that make it inappropriate for any of them to by the market or by marketlike mechanism
that is there be something inappropriate about people have private property right in these thing in the same way they do with other owned object
the criticism be not that the market inefficiently produce or distribute these thing instead the charge be that there be something inherently objectionable about a system that produce or distribute these good or service in this manner
for example if a destitute filipino be willing to sell one of her kidney to a rich american the problem with a economic system that permit this sale be not according to this way of thinking that the market in human organ be too thin for robust bargaining to take place or even that the market be a inefficient way
to allocate transplantable organ
rather the charge be that there be something objectionable about the very fact or be it the very idea of people sell their own body part
because these criticism be direct at the scope of the free enterprise
the main function of the free enterprise system indeed of any economic system be to meet people s want and need for exchangeable good and service
economist efficiency criticism criticize how well the free enterprise system do this job whereas philosopher scope criticism focus on how extensive that job ought to be
however there be another type of criticism come from philosopher that do not easily fit either of these category
some criticism be direct not at the free enterprise system qua economic system but instead at some side effect of its operation
the free enterprise system can permit and even require allegedly objectionable thing to happen that be not directly relate to this main function
for example egalitarian charge that the free enterprise system permit and indeed promote morally unacceptable inequality in wealth and income
civil right advocate charge that the free enterprise system have permit morally objectionable racial discrimination and segregation in housing
the purpose of the economic system be not to generate income inequality or segregated housing a foreseeable side effect of the system s operation
accordingly let us call criticism such as these sideeffect criticism
although philosopher who offer scope and sideeffect criticism of the free enterprise system sometimes do not conceive of themselves as criticize the economic system per se their criticism can be conceive of in this way because they be direct at the property right that define that system
private property right permit and indeed encourage the objectionable thing to happen
philosopher who offer these criticism conceive their central task to be the theoretical justification of the intuition that there be something objectionable about the current state of affair
why should occupational risk not be distribute by the market what be wrong with significant in equality in wealth and income why be the lack of equal opportunity a injustice the theoretical justification for the relevant moral judgment usually consist of the articulation of part of a moral or political theory which include some general principle that imply the intuition
if this be well do it the author and those who share the author s intuition
it be a interesting question which can not be pursue here whether this procedure merely systematizes the prejudice of the author and those who share her sentiment or whether there be something more objective take place
that potential difficulty to one side what i now want to suggest be that many if not most scope and sideeffect criticism of the free enterprise system face the same problem that have plague economist efficiency criticism
the critic have either fail to specify their preferred alternative to private property right or to the extent that they have specify a alternative they have fail to explain how it will solve the problem they have call attention to without result in something equally bad or bad
let us consider scope criticism first
often those who offer such criticism of the free enterprise system do not have much to say about how the good or service in question ought to be produce or distribute except that market mechanism be rule on costbenefit analysis as a basis for decisionmaking about worker health and safety elizabeth anderson devote nearly her entire article to the reason why market or mechanism that mimic the market should not beused in this area
the discussion of alternative by contrast be limit to less than a half a paragraph of vague remark about the advantage of participatory institution 
other scope criticism offer specific advice about what ought to be do but fall to consider systematic unintended negative consequence that may result from attempt to institute their proposal
for example in a recent article in philosophy and public affair margaret jane radin argue that private property right in rental housing ought to be significantly restrict by rent control on the ground that housing ought not to be treat as a mere commodity
despite the detailed blueprint for rent control legislation she draw up nowhere in her article do she consider the possibility that the people who frame and interpret this legislation will not be most interested in do what radin believe be right from the interest of the intended beneficiary
this be important in light of the fact that in numerous city where rent control have be implement welloff and articulate tenant have benefit significantly from rent control policy which have not only ruin many landlord but also harm poor and inarticulate tenants as marxist like to say this be no accident
""
the same problem that face scope criticism also face sideeffect criticism
the first kind of difficulty the failure to articulate genuine alternative be most evident in case where the criticism of the free enterprise system be indirect
for example ronald dworkin offer a qualified defense of equality of economic resource as a political ideal naturally this equality be not realize or even approximate by the free enterprise system
implement this idea require a political authority to equalize difference due to natural endowment by compensate those with disability and impose a progressive income tax on those with exceptional natural talent
to carry this equalization out political authority need a market to determine the as alexander rosenberg have point out however the kind of market dworkin envision could never exist in reality since it assume away crucial problem imperfect information time constraint etc realworld market system have to confront it might be respond that dworkin s ideal market be a analytical device intend to help us think through what equality of resource amount to as such it be not intend to describe a actually existing institution
but this response concede the very point at issue namely that dworkin have fail to describe a alternative to currently existing institution
some sideeffect criticism of the free enterprise system do specify alternative institutional arrangement but fail to explain how the new rule will solve the problem the critic have identify without result in something equally bad or bad
a telling example can be find in john rawls s discussion in a theory of justice of the implementation of his principle of distributive justice
rawls envision a re distribution branch of government in a market society with private be to preserve a approximate justice in distributive share by means of taxation and the necessary adjustment in the right of property the purpose of these levy and regulation be not to raise revenue release resource to government but gradually and continually to correct t he distribution of wealth and to prevent concentration of power one need not be a marxist to believe that the state often represent someone s interest other than the public interest or even more implausibly the interest of justice
it be rather naive of rawls to suppose that political authority could find no use for the vast power require to implement this substantial redistribution of wealth and income other than insure distributive justice
casual empiricism concerning the behavior actually existing state suggest that once the state have the power to finetune the distribution of wealth and income the chance that a society s actual distribution of wealth and income will even approximate the demand of justice whatever those demand might be be remote at best
throughout this section and indeed throughout the book rather complicated ideal to determine the working of the political system
there seem therefore to be a general problem about alternative face philosopher scope and sideeffect criticism of the free enterprise system
philosopher like economist have not think through alternative to the economic system they be criticize
can anything be say on their behalf to investigate this question let us consider how the philosophercritic might try to defend himself
the most obvious excuse be to appeal to the division of labor
one can not do everything and the philosopher be best suit to establish or expose systemic defect of contemporary social institution it might be modestly admit that philosopher do not have the relevant empirical background knowledge or expertise to spell out the alternative
in addition it might be argue that new institution have to come about through concerted political action which require a correct reading of the current political situation the philosopher have no special expertise about that
on a more positive note it might be argue that the the normarive or ethical evaluation of existing institution
there be some suggestive parallel on this score in ethical theory and epistemology that make this position look attractive and defensible
ethical theorist and epistemologist who have reflect long on the relation between theory and practice in their subject matter might well come to something like the following general conclusion human being be a pretty sorry bunch in their personal and cognitive behavior
there be no hope of reform them of get them to clean up their act
any serious attempt to do so will either be irrelevant or make matter bad
the task of the theorist be simply to evaluate and explain their practice in accordance with the appropriate intellectual standard
so the ethical theorist might say that he be only interested in evaluate human action andor character it be fanciful to believe that ethical theory can or should result in less immorality in the world
in a similar manner a epistemologist might maintain that his only aim or purpose be to evaluate human cognitive activity the idea that among the result of his epistemological investigation could be a general improvement in cognitive hygiene be as fanciful as the belief that the practice of ethical theorizing could reduce the severity or incidence of sin
by analogy it be enough for the political philosopher to identify in a systematic way the defect of existing institution including the free enterprise system
propose alternative need not be part of that critique
if he can propose a feasible or realizable alternative more power to him but there be nothing in his enterprise qua political philosophy that require any account of alternative
it may well be that there be no internal inconsistency in this position as it apply to political philosophy or for that matter as it pertain to ethics or epistemology
the problem be that even if this be a consistent position it be incompatible with what critic of the free enterprise system evidently beleive they be do
these critic seem to conceive of their task as provide reason for social change institutional rule especially property right
this be true even of relatively abstract theory of justice such as what one find in the writing of rawls and dworkin
these theory very often clearly imply that the free enterprise system have certain defect defect that warrant or justify institutional change
we know that institutional change be not a completely rational process in the sense that social change closely track the best argument of the day but no social thinker believe himself or herself to be so remote from the lever of social change that his or her writing could not have a impact on the shape of social institution
perhaps more importantly if the critic of the free enterprise system do not conceive of his task as at least in part provide reason for social change he be leave open the possibility that genuinely beneficial change in the economic system in some particular respect might well be impossible
this possibility reflect a pessimism or conservatism that few critic of the free enterprise system seem to endorse
moreover a serious possibility intellectual honesty would require that one call attention to it
since critic of the free enterprise system have not call attention to this possibility without exception as far as i can tell and be we shall presume intellectually honest they must believe that there be potentially feasible alternative to the way thing be currently do
for these reason failure to specify alternative be not a live option for philosophercritics of the free enterprise system
to the extent that these critic have fail to specify alternative institutional arrangement or explain how the latter would solve or ameliorate the problem they have call attention to without cause something comparably bad to happen they have fail to come to grip with the conservative point of view
this will come as no surprise to partisan of this perspective
the general conservative line be to admit that existing social institution be plague with a variety of defect and problem of varying seriousness but that nothing much can be do about them without make matter worse more detail since it represent a kind of stand threat to social criticism as it be currently practice by philosopher a threat to which most contemporary political philosopher have be oblivious
when the institution be criticize be the free enterprise system there be basically two possible conservative responses one deny that the free market or the private property right that define it be responsible for the problem instead the government be to blame or perhaps the problem lie in human nature
a second response grant that the system have the problem to which the critic have call attention but deny that any effort should be make to do anything about it at least at the institutional level in particular state action restrict or abrogate private property right either will not solve the problem or will create some systematic unintended consequence that be at least as bad as the original problem
notice the parallel between these conservative response to philosopher criticism and the two critique of economist efficiency criticism discuss early in this paper absolve the free enterprise system of the charge the critic have lodge against it by blame something else
on the other hand conservative be sometimes willing to concede usually sotto voce the critic s complaint against the free enterprise system but like the public choice theorist they object to the idea that state restriction or abrogation of private property right be the best or even a good response to the problem
the conservative position on any of these question may not be the correct one but this be something that philosophercritics of the free enterprise system must show
what exactly do this entail what must the critic of the free enterprise system do to defeat the conservative challenge that do nothing be the best counsel it be important that the argument of this paper not face the selfreferential paradox of fail to provide positive suggestion about how critic should proceed at one level the answer be fairly obvious the critic must specify alternative institutional arrangement and explain how these arrangement will solve or ameliorate us consider in some detail what each of these requirement amount to
because scope and sideeffect criticism of the free enterprise system be direct at a system of private property right in the mean of production the proposed alternative will involve systematic change in those right
those change have to be spell out
since any system of property right be a system of permission and prohibition on certain activity associate with whatever be own a proposal for change in property right be a proposal for a change in this system of permission and prohibition
when private property right be under critical scrutiny this proposed change usually take the form of private individual or group be require to or forbid from do something that have previously be merely permit
for example it might be propose that business should be require to maintain certain health or safety standard that have previously not be require
or it might be propose that employer be to be forbid to fire employee at will and must instead show just cause and respect arrangement include a new or expanded government program as well as a restriction of private property right
in the case of scope criticism there might be a proposal for a government program to deal with the want and need that elicit a market response in the first place
implicit in some sideeffect criticism eg some criticism of the distributive justice of the free enterprise system be rather extensive government program to correct the problem allegedly cause by the operation of the free enterprise system
finally implicit in many radical sideeffect criticism as well as radical efficiency criticism be proposal for a entirely different economic system usually a socialist one
this system have to be define in terms of the property right it envision
just as the critic must articulate the change in property right he or she have in mind and the associated government program if any it be also necessary to argue that these change will in fact have the desired effect
one thing this mean be that it be result
politician often entitle their legislation in terms of the hopedfor result eg the paperwork reduction act social critic must avoid this way of thinking
it will always be a contingent question whether the envisioned institutional change will do what they be intend to do
to illustrate these requirement more concretely let us consider two criticism of the free enterprise system one of which adequately address them and one of which do not
up until the mid the economic system of the united state in virtue of law recognize and enforce private property right permitted owner of public accommodation to refuse service to anyone for whatever reason
owner of many business in the south and elsewhere refuse to serve black people or segregate their facility base on this right
many people come to believe that the law respecting unrestricted private property right in public accommodation be unjust in this instance
this be a sideeffect criticism of the economic system
passage of the civil right act of curtail private property right in public identifiable injustice and it will come out that way on just about any theory of justice
obviously after the fact it be easy enough to specify the alternative but even before the fact it be not difficult to spell out the proposed institutional change
the envisioned change be narrow and relatively welldefined no more segregated lunch counter colored only drinking fountain rest room etc
""
the government be not tell businessman how to run their business they be only say however you run your business do not discriminate on the basis of race
in short what be required and what in the end be enact be a law that prohibit racial discrimination in public accommodation
it be also possible to foresee that the law outlaw discrimination in public accommodation would for the most part be effective even if the exact extent and duration of resistance could not be foretell
it be reasonably clear what the prohibited behavior be those whose right be and by the midsixties the federal government have the will and the mean to enforce the law
in addition there be threat of private action eg boycott in case of noncompliance
all of these factor come together to make it rational for most owner of public accommodation to comply with the law whatever their personal feeling
one final factor that explain the success of this change in property right be that businessman be about the most easily intimidated group in contemporary society which be why they be often call upon to lead the way in matter of social change
as a result black people in the us today do not suffer the systematic indignity visit on them in the past when they be routinely deny equal access to public accommodation
some conservative who oppose the civil right act do so on the ground that there be nothing morally objectionable about segregation and discrimination
that is they do not see a problem that need solving
at best this manifest a certain sort of insensitivity conservative concern be that this act would set a bad precedent
it would give federal government increased power at the expense of state and local government and it would set the stage for more pervasive governmental interference in the future
here the concern be with unintended negative consequence of a proposed change
the proponent of change can grant that these be legitimate worry but still maintain that the change ought to be institute on the ground that the benefit in terms of utility justice or whatever outweigh the risk
moreover even if these conservative bad fear have come to pass it be surely a oversimplification to attribute the resultant problem to antidiscrimination statute
these concern to one side however the main point of this discussion be that this be a case in which the free enterprise system can be and indeed be criticize in such a way that the demand for a specification of a alternative could be meet
let us consider now a case where a criticism of for a alternative
in elizabeth anderson s survey article refer to above value risk and market norm the author nicely articulate a number of reason why it be objectionable to allow issue of worker health and safety to be decide by the market or costbenefit analysis which be supposed to mimic the market
in answer to the question what ought to be do she say
the people who be place at risk should have the opportunity to participle directly in the decision which affect them
they should have the power to propose debate and vote on alternative health and safety project and to participate in the implementation of these project
for example customer of and resident put at risk by a local power company could elect representative to a committee join by elected representative of worker and stockholder in the firm which would be invest with the power to make health and safety decision regarding the plant 
this passage be typical of discussion of alternative that the free enterprise system
although it look as if the proposed change be describe in terms of a institutional process it be in fact a description of a result namely widespread participation by those affect
only in the third sentence be the reader give any idea about what institutional mechanism be supposed to insure this result
moreover the proposed institutional change be so thinly describe that it be not even clear that it be coherent
the main difficulty be that it envision a transfer of some but not all management right from the original owner to this new committee
base on what anderson say it appear that this committee be supposed to have the power to order expenditure institute program and so forth
assume the manager retain other management right this mean that management right be fragment among different and independent group
the problem be that it be not clear that such a pattern of right could persist in anything but name only
because this committee could significantly affect the profitability have a strong incentive to do everything it could to control it
it be not obvious how this could be prevent without transfer effective control of the mean of production to this committtee or some third party eg the state
in defense of anderson it might be point out that she explicitly recognize in a footnote near the passage under discussion that she be not propose a institutional framework her word as a alternative
moreover she refer the reader to chapter of james campen s benefit cost and beyond for a more elaborate discussion of alternative
however this footnote be reveal in two respect
the very fact that she have relegate this crucial issue to a footnote indicate importance she attach to the discussion of a alternative in a critique of the free enterprise system
far in the work to which she refer the reader the author state that this participatory alternative require the replacement of the free enterprise system with socialism
campen say in the of bca benefitcost analysis require a democratic socialist society
 if anderson endorse these sentiment in her critique of the free enterprise system in this article then she be really advocate some version of socialism in which case she should say so and defend its feasibility
moreover the consideration adduce in the second previous paragraph support campen s contention that socialism would be require
under these circumstance it be disingenuous for anderson to avoid mention the s word
finally and most importantly in the absence of a defense of the feasibility of some alternative nothing anderson say refute the claim that despite its drawback the current system be the best way to deal with risk in the workplace
this problem be especially press in light of the fact that no existing socialist system deal with worker health and safety in anything remotely resemble the way she recommend
feasibility in the above sense should not be confuse with
political practicality
judgment about what be politically practical be timesensitive be legitimately beyond the philosopher s purview
perhaps more importantly the political practicality of a proposed change be really a question of the likelihood that the change can be make not the chance that the change if institute will achieve the desired result
the upshot be that effective and intellectually responsible social criticism do not require a practical political blueprint for initiate social change
maybe a better term to describe what be need be realizability
what the critic must sketch be a realizable alternative
this require not only the articulation of change in the existing system of property right but also some kind of argument or explanation for how these change will produce the desired outcome without at the same time produce comparably bad systematic unintended consequence
what in general term might such a argument or explanation look like
what be need be some sort of plausible story about what people will do if and when private property right be alter in specified way
such story can be tell at different level of abstraction apply the formal technique first develop in microeconomics to generate explanation and qualified prediction about what happen when governmental decisionmaking property right supplant private decisionmaking property right
however this be not the only way to think about what happen when change in property right be institute
a more informal method involve simply ask what positive and negative incentive would be create by the proposed change and how the affected people would respond to the change
for example if the proposal be that the law should be change to require or prohibit certain action on the part of those who own or manage productive resource some reason have to be offer to persuade us to believe that the law can be efficiently enforce
one need not assume that those affect be especially venal in order to see the point of this
it be part of the nature of the situation that these people be not spontaneously do what they be supposed to do
the whole idea be to use the force of law to get them not do
there have to be some reason to believe that they will actually do it and not succeed in take evasive action
this potential problem may not be very serious when the envisioned change be a nottoodrastic restriction on the exercise of some ownership right and a plausible story can be tell about how it will be enforce eg the civil right case sketch above
on the other hand the problem be potentially much more serious when the proposed change significantly disrupt previous way of do thing and when there be additional positive and negative incentive for noncompliance
the imposition of affirmative action quota in hire and promotion come to mind as a obvious case in point
the sort of storytelling describe in the preceding paragraph assume imperfect rationality and rather limited benevolence
of course these assumption be not universal truth about human nature but they do not have to be
they need only be roughly accurate description of most of the affected people in the society under discussion
that point to a abstract picture of human nature which can then be manipulate more systematically
however it be not obvious that this would improve predictive power over what common sense can tell us
the whole idea of the approach advocate here be to use common sense to make some rough prediction about what ordinary people would do if proposed change in property right be to go into effect
what result from speculation of this sort will be lack in analytical rigor and potentially contestable
however there be no reason in principle why such speculation should tell us less about what would happen in the real world than do highly abstract model of human behavior favor by many economist
perhaps more importantly this way of thinking be perfectly suit to address conservative concern about systematic unintended negative consequence of institutional change
the conservative say ordinary people face with the institutional change you envision be go to frustrate your design by do or not do x y and z the approach outline above take this challenge seriously time and again philosophercritics of the free enterprise system have fail to do thi this in part account for the air of unreality that surround much of contemporary political philosophy
what be at stake in all of this be of some general importance
there be a long history of critique of modern institution especially the free enterprise system that have not be accompany by proposal for alternative institutional arrangement beyond the vague intellectual armwaving
the appearance of modesty involved in plead ignorance about empirical matter may well belie a unwillingness to come to grip with the possibility that not all desirable change be really feasible not just for the moment but as far into the future as it make sense to look
until philosophercritics take seriously the problem of think through alternative institutional arrangement their critique of existing institution will be incomplete and political philosophy will continue to be largely ignore by practical man and woman who directly shape the structure of social institution

the program describe in this paper be design to facilitate analysis of stereotyped locomotion by measure the repetitive nature of trip between adjacent quadrant of the apparatus use a method describe by mueller hollingsworth and cross a which subdivide locomotion into a series of trip length
the program be write in microsoft quickbasic to run on a ibm pcxt or compatible machine
data from the program can be read by spreadsheet
the clinical effect of antipsychotic drug be think to involve dopamine receptor blockade in the brain
inject animal with amphetamine in order to increase dopamine transmission have prove to be a useful model of schizophrenia
for example antagonism of amphetamineinduced change in open field behavior be a widely used screening technique in the search for compound that could be use in the treatment of schizophrenia
this research be motivate by the need to develop new drug treatment which do not acute dystonia and tardive dyskinesia associate with some antipsychotic drug
in the past most attention be focus on antagonism of amphetamineinduced stereotyped head and forelimb movement sniff lick and gnaw because these behavior be reduce by so called classic antipsychotic drug such as haloperidol
paradoxically more recently develop atypical antipsychotics such as sulpiride have be find to increase some amphetamineinduced stereotyped behavior robertson macdonald 
atypical antipsychotics be potentially of great clinical significance because they have be find to produce fewer extrapyramidal side effect in patient
this asymmetry in the effect of classic and atypical antipsychotics in the animal test system lead robertson and macdonald to cast doubt on the validity of antagonism of amphetamineinduced stereotyped behavior as a test of antipsychotic potential
recently ljungberg and ungerstedt have show that both classic and atypical antipsychotics reduce the increase in locomotion produce by amphetamine
traditionally the effect of amphetamine on locomotion and stereotypy have be consider separately but produce stereotyped locomotion which be characterize by perseverative movement along a fixed route around the periphery of the open field schiorring 
there be several reason why the study of stereotyped locomotion have be relatively neglect a the most popular technique for record amphetamineinduced locomotion utilize photobeam device that do not record the spatiotemporal characteristic of movement b subtle variation in a animal s route be not easily detect by a human observer and c until recently statistical technique which reflect the essential invariant and repetitive nature of stereotyped locomotion have not be available
a number of laboratory have address these problem
geyer russo segal and kuczenski link a photobeam apparatus to a computer so that the stored sequence of beam break could be use to create diagram show the spatial pattern of locomotion around the apparatus
kenyon describe a lowcost system which use a handheld mouse to trace the subject s path into a microcomputer for detailed analysis
the system allow the experimenter matrix of region and provide a printout give the temporal sequence of movement between these region
the present paper describe a computer program stereo which analyze stereotypy in spatiotemporal pattern of locomotion
although the term stereotyped have be use to label different behavioral manifestation of the amphetamineinduced syndrome szechtman eilam teitelbaum golani it be clear that stereotypy be measure most effectively in terms of criteria that reflect the repetition and invariance of particular response evoke by the drug
mueller hollingsworth and cross a describe simple statistics which quantify the repetitive nature of trip between region of equal size mark with line on the floor of a open field
a single trip consist of a sequence of movement between adjacent region and be terminate when the animal reverse direction or complete a tour of the perimeter
trip length be define as the number of region enter line cross during a trip
two successive trip of equal length be term repeat trip a change trip be hollingsworth and cross a introduce a statistic gamma which be define as the number of repeat trip divide by the number of repeat trip plus change trip
mueller kunko whiteside and haskett b have show that trip length vary as a function of amphetamine dose
we have find mueller hollingsworth and cross s a approach to analyze stereotyped locomotion useful but the classification of movement between region into appropriate trip type from a list of region enter be error prone and time consume
for example if the floor of the open field be divide into four region there be thirtysix possible combination of region entry that need to be consider when assign a trip to one of the four possible trip type
the program be design to overcome these problem
stereo assume the floor of the open field have be divide into four region label and and that a complete trip in a clockwise direction around the consist of the sequence 
this trip would be assign a length of and classify as trip type 
the program write in microsoft quickbasic read the sequence of region entry from data statement which appear at the top of the program
this method of data input be choose so that a word processor can be use to prepare data for analysis
the code be use to indicate the end of a trial
there be no limitation on the number of trial that can be analyze by stereo
the code finish be use to terminate process data from a individual subject
the data from several subject can be anlayzed sequentially
the code notendofdata be use to indicate that data from another subject should be process the code endofdata be use to terminate process data from a group of subject
the edited data file should be load into the program use quickbasic s file by stereo
the printout present a breakdown of the number of trip type for each trial together with the number of repeated trip of each type
a center trip be score whenever the subject cross between any of the region of the open field that be diagonally opposite each other eg from region to region 
a center trip be classify as trip type 
the printout report the actual sequence of trip type
repeated trip of a particular length be present on a single line of the printout the print head be reset to the start of the next line whenever there be a change in trip type
the printout contain detail of the number of clockwise and anticlockwise trip around the perimeter of the open field and present them in their sequence
a complete trip in a anticlockwise direction around the field start and finish in region would consist of the sequence 
in addition to display result on screen stereo also store and gamma value for each subject in comma separated value csv file name tripn rtripn and gamma respectively
the value of xxn correspond to the appropriate trip length for the stored data
these file can be read by spreadsheet program such as supercalc
a copy of the source code for stereo can be obtain by write to the author enclose a formatted disk and selfaddressed disk envelope

group of american and japanese manager complete a research questionnaire which be develop to collect judgment on the behavior skill and other attribute of supervisor whose personal productivity be very high
analysis of respondent data indicate that american and japanese perception of personal productivity characteristic be positively correlate and overlap particularly in such skillbehavior area as plan motivation communicate leadership efficient use of resource and decision make
difference between the two group with respect to certain style dimension be also find
japanese manager endorse behavior that be otheroriented and principleoriented
example of the latter deal with strategic and innovative viewpoint employee selection and performance monitoring
typical american response tend to focus on more instrumental notion of individual supervisory skill communication work with people knowledge of product belief in hisher own ability to succeed and decisionmaking technique
this paper report the result of research investigate difference between american and japanese manager in terms of their perception of skill behavior and other attribute which relate to as part of a comprehensive study direct at identify key managing skill
a number of managing skill dimension have be postulate include planning and organize decision make written communication group interaction leadership ethics and integrity
american industry today be be challenge to enhance organization and individual performance across several criteria of effectiveness including productivity and product or service quality
accordingly it be decide to investigate the feasibility of develop a personal productivity dimension by identify a number of skill behavior and other attribute which characterize supervisor who be highly productive
this paper summarize the key finding in that study focus particularly on the perception of american and japanese manager regarding personal productivity of supervisor
method
for purpose of this study personal productivity be define as the supervisor s ability to get lots of thing do and do well in a time period
a personal productivity research questionnaire be construct use item generate through a survey of manager supervisor and mba student employ respondent be ask to think of a supervisor with whom heshe be familiar whose personal work productivity be very high in the top of all supervisor on this criteria
base on this perspective the respondent be ask to list one or more characteristic of that supervisor cite behavior skill trait or other attribute
a total of response be obtain
three member of the business school faculty review the response sort them into category and generate reasonably distinct questionnaire item
the reduction be carry out to diminish the volume of item to be present in a final survey form while preserve the wide variety of item topic suggest by survey respondent
the item select finally cover a broad spectrum of attribute range from those typically appear in management behavior checklist to such area as work habit ethics speed reading personal financial planning etc
participant complete the questionnaire by read each of the behaviorskill attribute item and place a check mark alongside those item which in their judgment again among the top of all supervisor on this dimension
copy of the final personal productivity research questionnaire be complete by supervisor and manager employ in a variety of firm locate in southeastern michigan about twothirds of the sample be employ in auto and autorelated organization
the instrument be also complete by a group of japanese national who be work in a local steel fabricate firm
the japanese subject have be assign by their parent firm in japan to work as manager and technical specialist in a local joint venture organization
all be experienced supervisor or manager and fluent in english
result
three contrast between american and japanese perception of supervisory personal productivity be outline below a overall response b area of agreement and c area of disagreement
overall response tendency
in the first analysis perform it be find that american and japanese subject respond to the questionnaire item differently the american overall mean number of check mark ie endorsement be counterpart japanese mean be about 
this difference in these item response frequency be statistically significant beyond the level
item variance be not significantly different
it be fear that a disparity between response distribution of this magnitude might complicate the interpretation of raw response data
accordingly it be decide to convert each item s response percentage ie number of check marksnumber of subject in the group to a zscore center on the group be overall percent response mean
in this manner item be scale separately for the american and the japanese manager group and each item be scale above or below the group mean in standard deviation unit
zscore reflect the group s relative assessment of item on a comparable scale of measurement
a complete listing of questionnaire item group response percent and zscore be available on request from the author
area of group agreement
pattern
a betweengroup product moment correlation coefficient be calculate at significant beyond indicate high overall agreement between the item to the personal productivity of supervisor
high zscore item
item be rankordered in zscore term for each group
within each group the item have the large positive zscore ie the most frequentlyendorsed item be select for far analysis
the result be display in table and 
six item be common to the two list that is these item be perceive by both subject group as highly characteristic of personally productive supervisor
table display these common item
note that the content area cover in these six item be among the fundamental management responsibility and skill typically associate with basic management planning motivate communication leadership efficient use of resource and decision make
thus both group of subject appear to agree that personal productivity of supervisor be relate to skillful practice of basic management function
there be also evidence that american and japanese subject hold different and sometimes oppose view on other aspect of high personal productivity
table show the seven zscore item ie those on which their endorsement diverge markedly
in the listing of the seven item endorse most frequently by each group of subject but not endorse by both group it can be note that japanese subject endorse four type of behavior otheroriented employee supervisionmonitoring a strategic view of the job and innovation
each of these dimension be typically encompass in the current literature deal with japanese emphasis on group harmony kaizen the attitude of constant improvement and principled management
the counterpart list of item rank high among american cover quite different dimension of management behavior and suggest a orientation to personal productivity which be more techniqueoriented instrumental and less themedriven
it should also be note that the two group display agreement on item which they both feel be not relate to personally productive behavior such as take a loaded briefcase home every night be a speed reader have a personal financial plan
low zscore item may reflect study
area of disagreement
divergent zscore
the item zscore for each group of subject be review to identify those item for which zscore difference between manager group be large
the eight item list in table exhibit high zscore difference than other item
the greatest difference arise with respect to selfconfidence teamwork commitment plan quantitative skill and several employeerelated behavior
in general american manager assess individual supervisory technique more highly than do japanese manager
the key area of disagreement center on supervisory style monitoring performance avoid reprimand and discipline and proper selection placement of employee
delegation be not consider to be a attribute of the japanese style of management apparently in either the homeland or in us transplant operation while employee involvement and participation in broadscale decision make be generally endorse in contemporary american management training program
conclusion
this research be carry out to assess difference between american and japanese manager with respect to their perception of behavior skill and other attribute which might contribute to supervisory personal across these culture as a correlate of the several dimension of supervisory skill which be consider basic to management job organize and planning motivation communication leadership concern for efficiency and decision make
contrast between the perception of american and japanese manager with respect to supervisory personal productivity be instructive
first it should be note that there be a high level of agreement between the group across all item in the personal productivity research questionnaire reflect a rather broad range of agreement between american and japanese perception
analysis suggest that both group of manager see basic management skill as correlate of personal productivity
beyond this core agreement however the group hold different view on matter of technique and principle
american manager take a somewhat more instrumental view of personal productivity focus on technique which be widely urge as desirable practicesorientations in modern business and industry many of these technique relate to skill which be individual in nature
quantitative skill be not see as positively relate to productivity a perception which may crosby and modern production system philosophy
far evidence of this instrumental orientation might be find in the american subject tendency to endorse more item as relate to personal productivity of supervisor than do japanese subject
among japanese manager however perception of personal productivity reflect a appreciation for teamwork innovation and principle personnel management
none of these idea be new
several year ago the president of nippon steel comment on the difference between american and japanese management suggest that while the us corporation be regard as a cold impersonal entity the japanese firm be see as a community with a common destiny japanese manager 
the theme of harmony between department and people overreach objective management style and hard and soft management skill have be persuasively offer as characteristic of the art of japanese management pascale athos 
the principal finding in this study be the relatively high degree of similarity in perception between american and japanese attribute of high personal productivity supervisor
the high correlation between item response across the group and the similarity of response to specific key item provide evidence of great similarity of view than some theorist would expect
perhaps the cofounder of honda motor company be right when he remark that american and japanese management be alike yet differ in all important respect ouchi 
this research would suggest that the area of dissimilarity be relatively few be principlecentered and constitute important feature of the japanese management style
fortyeight us air force academy cadet be study to examine the effect of individual attitude and organizational reward structure on the performance of a complex integrative task
a attitudinal survey be used to measure each subject s preference for cooperative or competitive situation
distinctly different group environment be create by give four group of six subject competitive instruction and another four group cooperative instruction
the performance criteria be the sum score across eight trial of a complex arcadetype computer game which require one subject to control horizontal movement and another to control vertical movement
although neither attitude nor reward structure alone influence performance their interaction be find to be very significant subject perform poorly when the reward structure do not match their individual orientation
implication for military and professional training program be discuss
deutsch identify two type of situation as end point on a continuum of interpersonal relation within group
he define cooperative situation as those in which the goal of all group member be positively relate ie the success likely
in contrast competitive situation be define as those in which the success of one member make the success of others in the group less probable
deutsch find that group and individual attitude perception and performance often reflect these different reward structure
since deutsch educational social and industrial psychologist have study the effect of alternative reward structure on a variety of task in many different setting
although most published report suggest advantage for cooperative reward structure johnson johnson many institution continue to employ individual competition in attempt to increase motivation and enhance performance klein 
other study have suggest that enduring individual difference in belief orientation or preference ie trait be a primary influence on behavior epstein jackson paunonen 
a study by cohen show not only that some subject have a marked preference for either competitive or cooperative reward structure but that these preference affect a variety of individual and group outcome belief or value system
in real life such personal epistemology be often more potent predictor of performance and satisfaction than traditional individual difference measure such as speed or intelligence greeno 
although result of study of the effect of attitude on group productivity be somewhat inconsistent cooperative person tend both to engender and to report high level of satisfaction shaw 
in this study we seek to vary independently both reward structure and individual attitude toward these structure
reward structure be manipulate to create either competitive or cooperative group of six subject
base on their response to a attitude survey subject be selectively assign to group with either competitive or cooperative orientation
the primary criteria be performance on a demanding arcadetype computer game modify to require coordinated input from two subject simultaneously
hence this study seek to identify the main and interactive effect of situational and individual factor on performance and satisfaction
it be hypothesize that advantage associate with cooperative reward structure and cooperative would extend to this complex interactive task
method
fortyeight freshman cadet fortyone male and seven female between the age of eighteen and twentyone volunteer to participate in this study
although subject do not receive remuneration participation in this experiment excuse them from two hour of unpleasant training and prize be offer for top performer
as cadet our subject be part of a select group of young adult
cadet at the air force academy have average sit score of be in the top of their graduate high school class and earn one or more varsity letter in athletics
as a group since cadet display such homogeneity on many measure of academic and athletic achievement they be often a poor experimental sample for individual difference study
their distinctiveness from the general population and restricted range be both problematic
however cadet do represent many young adult who be competitively select for entry and education in the most demanding profession
it be also true that despite their similarity in achievement fiveitem attitudinal survey be used to measure subject preference for cooperative or competitive environment figure 
subject be require to indicate their agreement or disagreement with each statement on a point scale
three of the statement reflect individually competitive orientation ie and and two reflect cooperative orientation ie and 
the sum of a subject s response to the competitive statement be subtract from the sum of hisher response to the cooperative statement the difference be use as a measure of cooperative orientation
the whale game a arcadetype computer game be the criteria task
specially develop to study human performance this game require subject to guide a blue whale to accomplish two distinctly different task eat plankton or crashing kayak
planktoneating be a tracking task which require subject to guide the whale toward a randomly drift plankton target
this task be generally simple but the unpredictable movement of the plankton make it uncertain and rather demanding
in contrast kayak appear at discrete location on the screen perimeter at predetermined time throughout the game
once on screen the kayak move one space horizontally and vertically toward the whale
this pursuit continue until either the kayak reach the whale or crash into one of twenty stationary iceberg display on the screen throughout the game
subject lose point for be harpoon but gain point if the kayak crash
subject be give explicit priority instruction at the beginning of each trial tell them which of the task be more important ie worth ten time more point
group of eight subject complete the attitudinal survey and receive basic instruction in the whale game during a initial onehour session
they accomplish eight practice trial four of each priority and record their score at the end of each trial
subject be then assign to eight sixperson group such that each group s average performance during the initial session have be equivalent
seven of the group contain one female and five male cadet the eighth be all male
no
within these constraint distinctly competitive or cooperative group be create to accentuate individual attitude through mutual reinforcement
a onehour experimental session take place approximately six week after the initial training session
the second independent variable in this study be the taskreward structure
four group receive competitive instruction another four receive cooperative instruction
a competitive reward structure be impose by tell the six subject in a particular group that only the top scorer among them would be invite to a pizza party
although most college freshman would not see this reward as very significant our subject seem quite take by it
the same reward be offer to cooperative group but the criteria be change
the cooperative reward structure be establish by tell subject that the combined score of all group member would be compare to the score of other group all member of the group with the high total score would be invite to the pizza party
thus in the competitive group the object be to perform better than other member to maximize the performance of the whole group
two different dependent measure be of interest
task performance be measure by the total number of point score on the two game task eat plankton and crashing kayak
the game itself be identical to the one subject have learn during the initial session but the way it be play be not
the six subject in each group share three computer
for each trial one subject control the horizontal movement of the whale and another control the vertical movement
this manipulation forced subject to interact with one another as would a aircrew
subject rotate so that they play one game of each priority with each of the other five subject
each subject control horizontal whale movement during five trial and vertical movement on the other five
both subject share the same score for a given trial but the rotation allow overall individual score to vary greatly
at the end of the session subject be ask to respond to five question use a six point scale
their willingness to participate in future experiment
the average rating on these five question be use as a measure of their satisfaction the second dependent variable
result
result from attitudinal question show that our subject do vary in their attitude toward competition and cooperation
the distribution appear to be normal with score range from to 
although data could have be partition to examine the effect of practice or difference in the two subtask this design support only use a single aggregate measure of performance for each subject
multiple regression analysis be use to identify the effect of attitude and reward structure on this measure of overall performance
in the first step of the analysis both attitude and reward structure be enter into the regression equation
the main effect of these two variable explain less than of the variance in performance
however when the interaction reflect by the product of the two variable be enter the portion of the variance explain xxr increase to 
the beta f 
score attitude reward
 interaction
to depict these result graphically subject be divide into three group competitive neutral cooperative and their respective mean score be plot separately for the two reward structure
the interaction can be clearly see in figure below
the greatest effect of reward structure be see in the performance of those with the most pronounced attitude toward either competition or cooperation
satisfaction be also a important dependent measure
in this case however the analysis show that only subject attitude have a significant effect
the correlation between attitude and satisfaction be df xxp lt two tailed
cooperative individual be more satisfied and willing to participate in future experiment
this result be not surprising what be surprising be the lack of significant relationship between satisfaction and reward structure xxr the reward structure interaction xxr and even task performance xxr 
briefly these result suggest performance be better when the reward structure match the individual s preference
this effect appear to be particularly detrimental to those individual with strong attitude who find themselves labor under incompatible reward structure
those with moderate attitude appear to be able to perform well in either environment
satisfaction be unaffected by performance or reward structure but show a positive linear relationship with subject expressed preference for cooperation
discussion
the expected direct relationship between cooperative attitude and reward structure be not find
however the pattern of result provide interesting insight into the dynamics which may underline other successful demonstration of the benefit of cooperation
early the issue be raise that air force academy cadet differ somewhat from other college freshman
one difference be the high level and diversity of their high school achievement
if one assume that a competitive attitude be positively associate with the academic athletic and extracurricular achievement use for selection to enter the academy our sample may have be more competitive than subject in relatively cooperative attitude be consider who might better represent a normal population there appear to be clear support for the proposition that cooperative reward structure increase performance
although attempt be make to employ a experimental task with enhanced ecological validity the duration of this experiment be less than one hour
most study which have successfully demonstrate the advantage of cooperation have involve week month or even year of task performance
might we expect advantage to accrue to cooperative group if this experiment be similarly extend cooperative individual be more satisfied and also more willing to participate in future experiment regardless of the reward structure or level of performance
to the extent that this increased motivation would lead to great persistence and more rapid skill acquisition cooperative subject might improve in comparison to their lesssatisfied morecompetitive peer
additionally we might expect positive relationship and social support system to develop among the group of cooperative individual with either reward structure
implication of these result for military and professional training interpersonal competition as a mechanism for increasing trainee motivation and ostensibly their performance
our result suggest that the shortterm effect of such a policy on performance be nil
emphasis on competition will enhance the performance of some trainee but will inhibit the performance of others
this beg the question of which trainee be help and which be hinder by such a policy
ideally those who be most likely to become competent and dedicated member of operational unit be those whose performance should be facilitate
however just the opposite result may occur if competitive reward structure be employ to train individual for work environment in which teamwork and cooperation be require
competitive reward structure benefit competitive individual
competitive individual especially those with pronounced bias be likely to perform poorly in cooperative environment
additionally competitive individual seem less likely to be satisfy regardless of their level of performance or the type of reward structure
from this perspective part of the answer to the question where have all our pilot go become distressingly clear this paper compare and contrast statement make by american and european psychiatrist on the etiology of schizophrenia
in the us lead figure in psychiatry hold increasingly to the view that the disorder be physiogenic at source from which it seem to follow that the appropriate treatment should similarly focus on physiological and pharmacological therapy
in contrast european psychiatrist seem to be divide in support for organic and psychodynamic explanation
some european writer have pointedly warn against overinterpreting recent study which seem to point to specific organic dysfunction and deficit as schizophrenogenic
for the past few year the newspaper periodically have report that new discovery be indicate that many psychiatric disorder be cause by organic factor
while such study tend to be experimental and require far research more and more people be inclined to believe that all mental aberration be either biologically or genetically determine
of course schizophrenia and depression the flagship of psychiatry top the list
it seem that behind every distorted thought there be a distorted molecule or a distorted
for example a heading on the first page of the new york time by schmeck november state genetic basis of schizophrenia be say to be find
according to this report in the british journal nature a link be find between schizophrenia and a abnormally function gene or cluster of gene on a part of chromosome 
the gene itself be still to be identify
the newspaper journalist report that in the same issue of the journal another international research team report that it find no link between schizophrenia and chromosome 
however the two study involve different group of people family in britain and iceland in the first study and a large family in sweden in the second
according to the second group of investigator there be no conflict between the two study since schizophrenia appear to be a biologically heterogeneous group of disease
while the first group may have a type that be reflect in chromosome the schizophrenic in the other study may
from these two study it seem that dsmiii have not solve the problem of diagnosis of the disorder
the conclusion draw by the journalist write in the time be that both study be important on two count
the first provide solid evidence italics add of a biological cause of some form of schizophrenia
therefore the evidence of a destructive upbringing or other bad early social experience be proven to be false
the second conclusion be that this finding be a first step in break the disease category into individual subtype which may enable investigator to find effective treatment for specific type of schizophrenia
however in a telephone interview one of the investigator tell the journalist that for the present the new research have no immediate application to diagnosis or treatment of schizophrenia in general
bellak a wellknown expert on schizophrenia find it necessary to react critically to the article by write a letter to the editor of the new york time in which he indicate that if reduction to single cause psychological care in its many facet will be underestimate
that would be a disservice to the patient and to society which often have to bear the financial and sometimes traumatic burden
let us not engage in simplistic black and white thinking november 
the print media have also report on the biological and genetic underpinning of other disorder
other condition where these be purportedly involve include anxiety impotence anorexia nervosa bulimia substance abuse hyperactivity and dyscalculia
headline announce the following discovery brain defect in violent people new york time a biological link behind borderline personality newsday schizophrenia focus shift to dramatic change in brain new york time study the biochemistry of panic newsday nd genetic defect link to illness manicdepressive disorder be trace to faulty gene on the x chromosome new york time new focus on multiple personality
time sleeping pill relate to schizophrenia new york post clue to suicide a brain chemical be implicate new york time blue gene find them cure depression daily news 
a exaggerated statement report in the new york time on november prompt me to write this paper
a full page ad appear with the heading mental illness be curable
but public apathy must be cure first
maestro leonard bernstein lead the way to find a cure
the purpose of the ad be a major fundraising drive of to find a cure for schizophrenia and depression
this drive be initiate by the national alliance for research on schizophrenia and depression narsad
leonard bernstein be enlist to usher in this drive by conduct the new york philharmonic orchestra on november in a performance at avery fisher hall
the parent organization for narsad be the national alliance for the mentally ill nami for the reader regarding the cause of mental illness
it be define as a brain disease which affect million people of all age
the cause in no uncertain term be describe as be due to biological and genetic factor
the actual word of the ad be as follow mental illness be a real scientific and biological entity as clearly as cancer multiple sclerosis and diabetes be scientific and biological entity
xxp
a
certainly in view of the still controversial finding in the literature regarding the specific cause of mental illness this description overstate the case
a similar ad appear in the new york time on september in which october be proclaim as mental illness awareness week by governor mario cuomo
it include the same definition as in the previous ad indicate that mental illness be real biological disease
""
later in this paper i shall provide example of professional in the united state equate mental disorder with disease this aspect i will document what some of the outstanding european psychiatrist have to say about the nature of schizophrenia and the problem involved in the use of neuroleptics
first i shall report on statement make by the national schizophrenia fellowship of the united kingdom in their promotional material annual report 
the national schizophrenia fellowship like the national alliance for the mentally ill be primarily a organization of parent whose offspring be schizophrenic
the following quotation indicate their view on causality in schizophrenia take from a leaflet entitle schizophrenia note for relative and friend no june 
because the patient can not usually explain what be happen in his mind it be not easy for other people even those who live with him to realize that many of the odd or upsetting thing he do be cause by the illness
it be especially hard because it be a mental and not a physical disease
italics add xxp 
in another leaflet of raise as to what cause schizophrenia
the answer provide follow no one know
it be not even know whether schizophrenia be really one condition or many perhaps with various cause
these statement certainly contrast sharply with the philosophy of nami in the usa and perhaps refreshingly so
since no one have be able to find the cause or cause of schizophrenia it be much better and wise to leave the matter of causation open rather than to become a firm believer in weak evidence
the general public do not possess the critical knowledge to evaluate the overstated pronouncement in the news radio and tv media
to far illustrate the openness of the national schizophrenia fellowship their august annual report have a article which read as follow new drug a dose of realism
the front page of the may issue of nsf news leave the reader with the impression that a major advance in the drug therapy of schizophrenia be just around the corner
admittedly this be qualify here and there but input of large sum of cash and retaining of professional to make this a reality
as the father of a daughter with schizophrenia and as a group coordinator i only wish that this be so
however i be also a professional pharmacologist engage in the teaching of medical student
i be involved in this area of research in the s and my current research specialty be neuropharmacology
in these role i must be more critical
it be particularly important that the expectation of patient relative professional career and politician alike be not raise above realistic level
for this reason i would like to give a more cautious view of the present situation with regard to the new drug grf produce by glaxo laboratory
xxp i statement by european psychiatrist on the organicity of mental disorder
in hafner a german psychiatrist who be the director of a new center of psychiatric research in mannheim edit a book entitle search for the cause of schizophrenia in which a number of european he state our knowledge of the etiology of the disease call schizophrenia have not yet make much progress from kraepelin s day xxp 
far the attempt to bridge the gap between pathogenesis and the etiology be still a daring undertaking xxp 
he feel that the research might have eliminate some false hypothesis
according to karl popper this be the most important way to get nearer to the truth
stromgren the wellknown investigator and former director of the aarhus mental hospital in risskow denmark state clearly that we should provide the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
with regard to the cause of schizophrenia we seem to by now have find nearly everything except the truth xxp 
janzarik a psychiatrist from bulgaria writing on the concept of schizophrenia indicate that so far there be no conclusively define disease know as schizophrenia of the concept be not base on medical discovery but rather on the intellectual model on which the orientation of the psychiatrist be base
shepherd of the bethlehem royal hospital of london advocate a research of wide scope than the purely organic
he state i would emphasize that in the absence of a established biological marker for the clinical investigator the significance of all such factor whether they be life event or virus family communication or season of birth depend on the strength of a association and be therefore essentially epidemiological xxp 
wing another wellknown british psychiatrist from maudsley be able to show that poverty in the social environment be a cause of clinical deterioration wing brown 
in he point out that basically all we know be that the age and sex distribution in schizophrenia be unlike that in any other major psychiatric disorder
it run a more sinister course for male and few schizophrenic seem to the small nugget of knowledge dredge from a sea of ignorance xxp 
hirsch of the london westminster school of medicine express his doubt about the significance of disparate finding in the study of schizophrenia
he write be these finding specific for schizophrenic or would other chronic institutionalized patient such as oligophrenics and chronic manicdepressive show the same change be they secondary to the disease process csf and cat scan finding may reflect change which be the result of arousal mechanism deficient diet local epidemic etc
he far state it be therefore particularly important these study be replicate in other cohort in other place xxp 
benedetti a swiss psychiatrist who work with manfred bleuler at the burgholzli clinic in zurich write the following in his recent publication regarding the limitation of biological causality
""
""
""
the lack of specific anatomical and biological finding in schizophrenia in spite of half a as they be in cerebral paralysis or in arteriosclerosis cerebri or in some inborn error of metabolism they would by their very presence reduce but of course not cancel the spectrum of psychological causality
xxp 
another argument which benedetti use be the fact that there be a constant occurrence of schizophrenia in spite of the relatively low fertility rate of schizophrenic
let me pursue further some of the writing that have appear in europe regarding the use of drug and other organic therapy
minton medical director of hampton hospital in england review the change in clinical practice from to 
he believe that the retention of drug therapy have make it possible for psychiatric personnel to accept the reality of a therapeutic contract with their patient only because at the back of their mind they have give great weight to the efficacy of the drug than to the wide social value of a more respectful approach to the patient and his treatment xxp 
with regard to shock therapy could be attribute to psychosocial factor involved in the treatment rather than the direct action of insulin
interpersonal relationship between personnel and patient have to improve with close supervision of these patient under insulin treatment
regarding ect minton be amazed at the amount of time and effort expend on argument about the merit of different electrical waveform and current strength when so little be do to inquire about the effect of the treatment
some psychiatrist have seemingly be fascinate by gadgetry with no real interest in the patient
with regard to psychosurgery minton write that it be very doubtful if these modernday prenologists of the innards of the brain have any great claim to accuracy in their prediction than their nineteenth century predecessor who more modestly and less dangerously settle for prediction base on surface lump and bump xxp 
he be quite surprised at the blind acceptance of these three therapy in vogue despite their immediate danger in disabling patient
he hope that psychiatrist might organize their discipline to ensure proper clare in discuss treatment and cure in mental illness be not optimistic that solution be around the corner
he write the following which reflect his discouragement at the slow progress in effectively tackle mental disorder
the natural history of most common mental disorder have still to be establish shepherd the majority of treatment currently in use be empirical clare and in so far as treatment as varied as ect and psychotherapy do appear to bring about remission there be still much discussion as the relative importance of placebo effect spontaneous remission and chance in effect such change
hogan 
yet some two decade ago psychiatry appear poise on the threshold of revolutionary breakthrough in treatment
however the change in psychiatry do not meet the criteria of what constitute a revolution there have be no overthrow of established system of thought and no significant break with the major therapeutic school of the past year
the enthusiasm of the vantagepoint of history singularly misplace
the fact that different development in therapy from psychotherapy to psychotropics from social psychiatry to behavioral approach have all in their time be dub revolutionary only far illustrate the tendency of psychiatrist in common with other active practitioner to believe that they live in a age of rapid and impressive advance
lewis 
he indicate that when psychiatrist find themselves with a tool which be believe to be effective they tend to use it indiscriminately
he quote sudhoff s analogy of a bad cobbler who try to fit everyone with the same shoe
deniker the french psychiatrist who be responsible with delay for the introduction of neuroleptics around the world in clearly state that the future of psychopharmacology seem in question xxp 
this be include in his presidential address of the international convention of the association of biological psychiatry of entitle should we withdraw antipsychotic drug treatment of depression believe to be the easy of the psychose to treat indicate that the situation have be dismal
he write the following the result of the drug be not impressive considering the fact that placebo be useful in one third of the case xxp 
furthermore he state in the last decade american have outdo the european in cultivate the kraepelinian viewpoint in psychiatry xxp 
dick a swiss psychiatrist after have analyze the literature on the use of lithium primarily from american psychiatric journal conclude with the following strong remark
because of the imprecision of lithium and the insufficiency of its foundation it do not allow actually not even to predict or even reveal useful sign or even factor of probability susceptible to orient toward the possibility of the efficacy of lithium
translate from the french xxp 
""
that statement certainly contrast with a recent review on the use of both of new york hospital in which they state
a review of lithium treatment ten year ago might have focus in its efficacy in acute mania and in prophylaxis of bipolar illness
while the role of lithium salt in the treatment of these condition be now unquestioned new issue be emerge now it have become a part of standard psychiatric practice and have achieve widespread acceptance by the lay public
these gain be real but much work need to be do to explore the expanding indication of lithium use xxp 
one would certainly wonder how such difference in conclusion could be make on the basis of the same literature
while the label of wonder drug be often use by news media and even psychiatrist a recently edit book by daly and sand from ireland and belgium respectively entitle psychological treatment of mental illness research strategy and diagnosis contain the following as a selfadvertisement the growing dissatisfaction with the excessive use of drug have encourage illness
the volume be the result of the work conduct by the study group of mental illness a priority activity of the european medical research council one of the five standing committee of the european science foundation
some time ago i write to goodwin a english psychiatrist at the medical research council in edinburgh who have be highly critical of a book on the biology of schizophrenia by trimble 
i ask whether he have far write criticism of the organic ideology
he respond with the following letter dated november 
thank you for your letter and the reprint of your paper on the issue of organic aetiology in psychiatric illness
i be a psychiatrist with a traditional british training and i think i share the consensus view of british psychiatry at present that the major psychiatric disorder certainly in adult must have some underlying biological substrate which we can also choose to call vulnerability to account for the evidence of a strong genetic effect a reading of any of the major recent text book of psychiatry publish in this country would i think reflect this view
antipsychiatry as embody by ronnie laing in the s be virtually a dead duck amongst psychiatrist although it still have a certain following particularly among paramedical staff particularly social worker and nurse
clinical psychologist in this country be increasingly interested in therapy rather than theory and the major focus at the moment be behavior therapy or cognitive therapy
that say my criticism of michael trimble s book be not its orientation but the extent to which it reflect a approach where the current evidence for organic aetiology be hold to be overwhelming and convincing
furthermore it seem to me to neglect the importance of genetic evidence in support the biological position
to leave that out seem to me to leave the emperor with no clothes at all to speak of
i can nt claim to have write anywhere else about this problem at any length but i think that it be a emergent one in british psychiatry in the last five year have evolve as a series of increasingly improbably speculation about the molecular basis of schizophrenia
what concern me about this be that scientific finding and logic be misapply in the same way that psychoanalysis misapply its version of observation and logic
in the end it may not matter eventually what anyone say in besides the certainty as i see it that we will see progress in the understanding of the aetiology of the major functional psychose in the next decade
however currently i think there be nothing to be gain and a good deal to be lose by make exaggerated claim for the organicists position which be unsupported by valuable experimental investigation
i be not sure that there need be a particularly vigorous controversy of the sort that you describe for autism
most people here assume that major psychiatric disorder require first of all the genetic or phenotypic predisposition combine with environmental toolong
controversy seem to arise out of see these mutually nonexclusive class of influence in psychiatry as be actually mutually sincerely g m goodwin md
of course i agree with his statement that there be nothing to be gain and much to be lose by make exaggerated claim for the organicist position which be unsupported by experimental investigation
in view of the interesting remark make by dr goodwin i ask him for authorization to use his letter in some of my writing
the response which i receive be just as pertinent as the first letter
it read as follow under date of december 
thank you for your recent letter
i have no objection to your include my previous comment in your work
however i would be glad if you would not refer to my remark about dr although his published contribution could illustrate the point that i be make i do nt want this to become in any way personal and particularly not by be quote at one remove
i be sure you would agree that the argument be about idea and i think you be probably right to highlight the usa
i suppose historically this have to be see as a reaction against previous dominance of psychoanalysis which be equally far from the general european position but in a sense in the other direction
as i say in my previous letter i be sure you would find plenty of support for your thesis in any recent text book of psychiatry publish in the uk ii
view express by psychiatrist in the usa regarding the etiology of mental disorder
i shall now turn to statement make by major psychiatrist on the etiology of schizophrenia which tend to be somewhat emphatic regarding its cause
andreasen be a american psychiatrist on the staff of the department of psychiatry at the university of iowa college of medicine and be on the editorial staff of the american journal of psychiatry
she be also a member of the dsmiii commission 
in she write a book on the biology of mental disorder which be extreme in its orientation
that book the broken brain the biological revolution in psychiatry state mentally ill can change only through increased understanding and knowledge
the change will be speed up far if people have a opportunity to learn about the transformation that have be occur in psychiatry during the past ten to twenty year
psychiatry like the prodigal son have return home to its place as a specialty within the field of medicine
it have become increasingly scientific and biological in its orientation
psychiatry now recognize that the serious mental illness be disease in the same sense that cancer or high blood pressure be disease
mental illness be disease that affect the brain which be a organ of the body just as the heart or stomach be
people who suffer from mental illness suffer from a sick or broken brain not from weak will laziness bad character or bad upbringing italics add
the recognition that mental illness be disease affect the brain be the basis of the biological revolution in psychiatry
this teaching have already do a great deal to diminish the fear shame and to understand its implication better we should enter a new era of genuine enlightenment concerning the nature of mental illness
its victim and their friend and relative will understand its nature and cause and be able to discuss them without shame and embarrassment
xxp 
in another part of the book she write
the major psychiatric illness be disease
they should be consider medical illness just as diabetes heart disease and cancer be
xxp 
as a result of her conviction she far write the following point out the need change that take place with the introduction of the dsmiii which she help to formulate
a second implication of dsmiii affect the way psychiatrist evaluate and interview their patient
ten or twenty year ago the patient who seek out psychiatric care be likely to receive and also pay for a relaxed and leisurely series of interview
the doctor would ask the patient about a wide range of subject in considerable detail including early childhood with his wife and child his attitude toward his boss or his work and his feeling about himself
somewhere embed among these query about personal and social aspect of his life be question about his symptom
while psychoanalyst will no doubt continue to use this type of approach in spite of dsmiii and indeed many of their concern and technique have little to do with the specific disorder describe in dsmiii the majority of psychiatrist be likely to focus on a evaluation of symptom much more quickly
they will usually attempt to determine the patient s diagnosis during the first onehour interview and will begin treatment whether it be medication or psychotherapy rather quickly after the first appointment
whereas the old style of psychiatric interviewing use to stress the openended question and abundant use of noncommittal uhs and ums interview base on a dsmiii approach be likely to be similar to those of internist or other doctor
italics add
the patient will be ask rather focused and detailed question how have your appetite be xxp 
this emphasis in dwelling on symptom suffer by patient rather than find out how they see their problem be illustrate in a book by kleinman who report on the result of a ethnographic study of psychiatric practice in the usa and china
he provide verbatim the exchange between a depressed research physician and a senior psychiatrist
the latter after the first interview prescribed doxepin for the depression
that same day the physician write the following in his diary
i do nt think he hear me
i want him to listen to me not for the diagnosis but for the story my story
i know i be depressed
but i want him to hear what be wrong
depression may be the disease but it be not the problem
the problem be my life
the center do nt hold
thing fall apart
it be fall apart
my marriage
my relationship with my kid
my my dream
be this the depression maybe it cause the depression
maybe the depression make it bad or seem bad
but these problem also have their own legitimate reality
this be my life no matter if i be depressed or not
and that be what i want to talk about to complain about to make sense of to get help to put back together again
i want this depression treat all right
there be something more i want however
i want to tell this story my story
i want someone train to hear me
i think that be what psychiatrist do
someone ought to do it ought to help me tell what have happen
but all he seem interested in be the diagnosis and my dad s death
i be sure that be part of it but so much else be go on
i need to talk to someone about my whole world not just one part of it
xxp 
that therapy seem to end with a simple labeling and the prescription of a drug
kleinman seem to be one of the few psychiatrist in the usa who be fight andreasen s extreme reductionism
i shall provide here a extensive quotation from kleinman s book which focus on the force which prevent psychiatry from look beyond the immediacy of relieving symptom with medication
there be a systematic resistance to deal with social source of depression and other psychiatric condition
perhaps the idea strike clinician as simply too difficult to operationalize in practical program
perhaps it also be too threatening since it suggest that expensive social program may be more availing in the long run as prevention than the use of drug and psychotherapy to treat individual episode of disease eisenberg 
there be also the unappealing reality that drug company and psychotherapist derive economic gain and livelihood from the treatment of depression no particular commercial interest will benefit from preventive program in spite of the fact that such program would contribute importantly to the economy of disability
there be no effective lobby for social research and sociotherapies to counteract the powerful lobby for biological research and treatment
and the exploitive orientation of the media to the late scientific breakthrough assure that biological rather than social issue will receive attention
even the family of the mentally ill find biological cause more acceptable since they indicate that mental illness be like all other disorder and they remove some of the burden of guilt
the cultural argument be that this situation be a symptom of the dominant force in our society and its institution
in spite of the interest of some psychiatrist and psychologist in social factor and prevention the orientation of the mental health professional overall contribute to this problem
for psychiatry the neuroscience hold out the hope of escaping marginality and catch up with the rest of biomedicine eisenberg for psychology cognitive science and behavioral medicine be the darling of research funding agency and hold the promise of financial support for clinical specialist
but the political economy and the cultural system the romance with biology and the devaluing of social science
xxp 
kleinman receive a degree in anthropology besides his medical training
in the preface of his book he deplore the fact that many psychiatrist seem to believe that a understanding of the biological basis of mental disorder be if not around the corner no more than two or three block away and that they tend to be deaf to cultural factor in mental disorder
even those psychiatrist who might be involved in crosscultural research have the tendency to focus on universal in mental disorder
according to kleinman there seem to be a tacit professional ideology that exaggerate what be universal in psychiatric disorder and deemphasize what be culturally particular xxp 
for example a study conduct by sartorius reveal that chronicity be more likely to develop in advanced society than in third world country
however as see by kleinman 
the author be silent on these point which in this project call determinant of outcome
that is to say the most important finding of crosscultural difference receive scant attention compare to that devoted to the finding of crosscultural similarity
hypothesis have be generate about the cause of differential outcome since the late s murphy cooper and sartorius waxler 
yet none of these seem to have be test
in the paper s conclusion the other finding of cultural difference in mode of onset symptomatology and help seek be deemphasized as well
xxp 
similar to andreasen s comment torrey indicate that schizophrenia be a brain disease now definitely know to be such italics add
hoffer osmond as report by szasz indicate that schizophrenia be a physical disease in the same way that pellagra diabetes and mental retardation be physical disease
this deficit cause the production of a poisonous

with respect to to andreasen only those who follow the organic view seem to have a humanistic or humane approach toward the mentally ill
of course the point could easily be argue
calicchia study the attitude of the three major mental health professional towards exmental patient and find that
the data show that while psychiatrist perceive the exmental patient to be relatively safe they consider them sic to be somewhat worthless and incomprehensible but even more significantly they view them sic as extremely ineffectual and undesirable
social worker on the other hand perceive the exmental patient worth and comprehensibility in a relatively neutral light and while they consider them to be somewhat dangerous and ineffectual they also view them as very undesirable
psychologist in contrast perceive the exmental patient as worthy safe and acceptable although somewhat ineffective and very mysterious
xxp 
this certainly be contrary to andreasen s view that a organic ideology be more likely to make mental patient more acceptable
siegler model of madness model of medicine extol the virtue of recent development in psychiatry
they feel that psychoanalysis have rob people of their medical right
even when there be no wholly satisfactory treatment for a illness a physician can make certain timehonored move that will alleviate the suffering of the patient and his family
he can give the disease a name and thus reduce its mystery italics add
he can rule out other and bad illness
he can reassure the patient and his family that the illness be a natural occurrence and that no one be to blame for it
exercise his authority he can confer the sick role on patient which place them within the medical model of illness
he can offer them the best available treatment
he can tell the patient s family that he be do everything that he can to help the sick person get well
we believe these move be precious and ancient right attach to the sick role in clinical medicine

to the method use by internist lipkowitz idupuganti send a questionnaire to five percent of the member of the american psychiatric association regarding the diagnosis of schizophrenia
of twentytwo symptom four hallucination delusion affect disturbance and thought or language disorder be most commonly mention but the concordance level be only fifty percent
comment on their finding they write the following
one of the major benefit of current research and of dsmiii be the separation of schizophrenia from other disorder that at present be far more effectively treat
our study raise the disturbing possibility that this research have not have a substantial effect on the diagnostic practice of us psychiatrist and that as a result many patient be not receive appropriate treatment
although this study do not flatter the current diagnostic practice of us psychiatrist it do indicate that some change be occur
young psychiatrist tend to use criteria other than symptom that have historically be consider pathognomonic for schizophrenia but that in hope that this trend will continue both for a improvement in the reliability of the diagnosis of schizophrenia and for increased specificity in the treatment of psychotic patient
xxp 
this seem to counter andreasen s belief that the dsmiii may be use with the accuracy of a medical diagnostic tool
andreasen have edit a more recent book entitle can schizophrenia be localize in the brain in which she express her enthusiasm regarding the connection between mental disorder and dysfunction of the brain
psychiatry be only begin to reclaim the brain as its organ
we be fortunate to specialize in the disease of the most interesting complex and important organ in the entire body
we be rediscover what hippocrates already know in the fourth century bc almost everything that we think do and feel derive from the brain
mental illness arise when the brain go awry in some way give abnormal command that lead to abnormal thought feeling and action
hippocrates know this the discipline of neuroscience during recent decade give us hope that we may actually be able to understand the brain mechanism produce mental illness during the year to come
xxp 
a more recent paper by andreasen express her great sense of optimism regarding this approach of brain study
brain imaging offer psychiatry a broad range of investigative technique that fulfill the popular fantasy of be able to read the mind albeit in the form of see the brain both structurally and functionally
at present brain imaging provide a modest amount of information that be useful in differential diagnosis as in distinction between depression and dementia
it have provide more information about possible pathophysiological mechanism of major mental illness including structural abnormality in some form of schizophrenia
metabolic abnormality such as hypofrontality in schizophrenia or hyperfrontality in obsessional disorder have also be observe
the longterm promise of brain imaging be substantial
it will permit the mapping of cerebral function in normal individual so that we can achieve chemistry and functional organization
on the basis of this knowledge the abnormality underlie the major mental illness can also be map
xxp 
but investigator on brain imaging connect with the national institute of mental health tend to be less enthusiastic about this approach than andreasen
weinberger review the finding of study use positron emission tomography pet singlephoton emission compute tomography spect and the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri and he remain fundamentally uncertain that this application of modern technology will lead to a breakthrough in the understanding of functional illness
szasz after study standard volume by pathologist that describe all the wellknown disease of the brain notice that they do not offer a single reference on schizophrenia or manicdepression
it seem according to szasz that psychiatrist ought to convince pathologist that schizophrenia be a brain disease before they take it upon themselves to tell the public that it be such a disease xxp the significance of the localization of schizophrenia in the brain
it be difficult to imagine that we will ever reach the day when the movement of molecule across cell boundary will be all that need to be say about human love hate envy and joy
to my mind that would be a incomplete description indeed
xxp 
reveley reveley british psychiatrist from the london institute of psychiatry argue that recent theory in the cerebral localization of schizophrenia show how investigator have become almost desperate in their inventiveness
conclusion
i have juxtapose statement make by european and american psychiatrist to illustrate this fact european be aware of the limitation of attribute schizophrenia solely to organic etiological factor and be aware of the limitation of the neuroleptic drug
in contrast american appear absolutely sure that the disorder be cause by organic factor and that neuroleptic drug have revolutionize psychiatry
the purpose of this article have be to illustrate the dominant ideology in the united state
one can find evidence and in newspaper
this philosophy likewise have find its way onto television in such program as innovation and the mind
of course journalist and lay person believe in the scientific truth of these statement which be often base on little more than speculation
thus what be presumably scientific fact be accept uncritically by a gullible public
some may be concerned that my reference be selective and therefore not representative of american psychiatry
however this blinding effect of dogmatism engel receive some support from a survey sanua xxp compare the view of european and american psychiatrist on the etiology of infantile autism
while my survey do not refer specifically to schizophrenia i feel confident that one s ideology on infantile autism could not be much different from one s ideology on schizophrenia
while psychiatrist in the united state believe that organic factor be highly important or somewhat important the percentage for european psychiatrist be and respectively
state believe that organic factor be highly important as compare to european psychiatrist
the figure for psychologist be and and social worker and respectively
thus it would seem that psychologist and social worker whose training should lend less support to the organic ideology tend to be more organic than physician perhaps precisely because they lack sufficient medical or neuroscience training to be as skeptical as european psychiatrist and be to that extent almost as gullible as the public
this experiment compare the extent to which student learn fact include in computerbasedtraining frame that require a overt response to those that do not
frame include two type of fact some fact have one word miss which have to be supply by the student active fact
other fact have no missing word and require no overt response passive fact
each student complete four fact module in random order
two of the module contain frame with all active fact
each frame in the other two module contain one active and six passive fact
paper pretest and posttests show that student learn twice as many fact when all fact in the module be active than when only one in seven be active
the module that include passive fact require onefifth the time to complete than those with only active fact
student learn more fact per minute of training in one of the two module that include passive fact than in the two module with only active fact
the capacity of computerbasedtraining program to interact with to education
computer can measure a student s response to question provide immediate feedback and adjust the course content base on the speed and accuracy of student respond
this facility of computer can be utilize only to the extent that student make overt measurable response that can be read and evaluate by computerbasedtraining program
the role of measurable or overt respond have be investigate in the noncomputerized medium of programmed instruction
numerous study have show that student learn more reliably when require to make overt response to question than when they be only require to read text holland 
furthermore student do not reliably learn extraneous material add to question requit overt response eigen margulies 
under some condition student may not even read training program material that be not need to answer the training program question doran holland doran and holland track student eye movement as they complete two training program and find that when all part of the text be not need to the part of the text necessary to answer the question
several study have find no difference between program require overt response and those not require overt response alter millicent silverman evans homme glaser hartman morrison carlson goldbeck campbell 
while some of these study may be methodologically flawed or contain idiosyncratic feature limit their generality holland these finding suggest that we do not completely understand the precise condition under which overt respond in programmed instruction improve learning
take together the study on overt respond in programmed instruction suggest that overt respond can significantly improve learn under some circumstance
despite this evidence and the enormous capacity of computer to interact with student many computerbasedtraining program have fail to maximize the use of overt respond vargas 
the current study be undertake to evaluate the role of overt respond in computerbasedtraining
primarily we seek to compare the extent to which overt response to those that do not
frame include two type of fact some fact have one word miss which have to be supply by the student active fact
other fact have no missing word and require no overt response passive fact
frame contain either a one active fact or b one active fact and six passive fact
each student complete four module in random order
two of the module contain frame with active fact
each frame in the other two module contain one active and six passive fact
each of the four module contain a total of fact
the extent to which student learn active and passive fact be evaluate on paper posttests administer after the completion of each module
this study also seek to determine if passive fact could be learn more reliably when present in a abbreviated format that only include key word and be arrange in a quasioutline or table format in which fact be place in predictable screen location
to accomplish that include passive fact be construct in the abbreviated outline format
finally computerbased training program frequently provide explanation after incorrect response to question that tell the subject why their answer be incorrect
these explanation be typically passive fact ie fact with no missing word and that require no overt response
if student learn passive fact only inconsistently these type of explanation should be of little educational value
this experiment also evaluate the effectiveness of explanation in teaching
to accomplish this evaluation frame in only one of the two module that include only active fact provide explanation for incorrect response
method subject
sixteen normal adult serve as subject
subject be recruit from advertisement and pay a fixed wage for complete four computerbasedtraining module and corresponding pretest and posttests
all subject could read and have at least a high school diploma
apparatus
the computerbasedtraining module be deliver on ibm and ibm compatible xts and ats with at least k of memory
the module be create and deliver use exemplar a intelligent tutoring inc
exemplar have a menudriven authoring system that allow author to create course without a programming language
exemplar s intelligent course tutoring system monitor student response continuously and utilize a standard set of builtin rule to adjust the pace and content of question base on each student s momenttomoment performance and the authorspecified module and frame parameter
procedure
module content
subject be teach seven fact about each of eight different state in the united state of america
the fact include the date that each state enter the union the number of county park and forest in each state and each state s bird flower and tree
each module contain the seven fact about each of two different state
module be comprise of question about these fact
module vary two question characteristic the number of fact present in each question box and the format of the question
question box either contain one or seven fact
figure present three sample box one contain one fact left box and the and right box
question contain all seven fact in one question box provide six of the state s fact in their entirety and omit only one the name of the state s tree in the sample box
module also differ by the question format question be either write in complete sentence or in a outline format that only present key word
figure also display the difference between sentence left and middle box and outline right box format
answer be always the date that the state enter the union the number of county park or forest in the state or the name of the state s bird flower or tree
for question that contain all seven fact about a particular state in the same question box the subject only have to provide the name of the state s tree
multiplechoice training
figure show the multiplechoice format in which question be present first
three incorrect choice be present with each multiplechoice question
the incorrect choice be eg the name of a bird flower or tree but the fact belong to a different state
since each module contain the same type of question about each of two different state eg two question request the name of a state s flower the answer for one of those question always serve as a incorrect choice for the other question of similar type
for example one module contain the following two question arizona s state tree be
and utah s state tree be
the answer to the first question be paloverde and the answer to the second be blue spruce
for these two question paloverde appear as a incorrect choice when blue spruce be the answer and blue spruce appear as a incorrect choice when paloverde be the answer
the state tree for two different state not question in the module or in other module in this experiment appear as the additional incorrect choice in both question
a similar pattern be follow for other
multiplechoice question appear in box line down and space across
four box label f f f and f appear below the question box
each choice box be line down by space across
a subject could answer a multiplechoice question by press one of the four function key f f f or f
the location of the correct and incorrect choice be randomize on each trial
exemplar s intelligent tutoring system control and adjust the pace with which question and choice be present to each learner by control and adjust four timing parameter initial read and response time and final read and response time
the length of time that the question remain on screen before the choice be present be call the read time
the time that the choice remain on screen without a subject response before they be remove be call the response time
the initial time be the read and response time for the first presentation of the question
the final read and training
each question be assign its own unique initial and final read and response time
initial read time be set at second per line of text
initial response final response and final read time be set at second second and second respectively
the read and response time be adjust continuously as training progress
if the subject respond correctly to a question the read and response time for that question be decrease on the next presentation of that question
similarly if the subject respond incorrectly to a question that question be read and response time be increase on its next presentation
if a student s answer to a question be correct the other choice disappear from the screen and the outline of the selected box thicken
if the student s answer be incorrect the other choice disappear from the screen the outline of the selected box change from a single to a double line and the correct answer reappear on screen
if the subject make no correct answer thicken and the other choice disappear from the screen
correctincorrect feedback remain on screen for up to second
explanation
in all but one experimental condition explanation be provide after incorrect response
explanation be tailor to each incorrect choice and specify the state to which the particular name or number ie incorrect choice belong
the line by space explanation box appear after the correctincorrect feedback and stay on the screen for second
explanation appear only for the first three selection of a particular incorrect choice
return key
except when a multiplechoice answer be require the subject could advance from the one screen to the next at any time by press the return key
module size and number
either two or fourteen multiplechoice question be present in each of four module
module that present only one fact in each question box contain fourteen question
module that present seven fact in each question box only contain two question
within each module question be present in successive a module be call a run
question be present first in a fixed order for two run
then successive run of randomly order question be present until all of the question in a module be master
each question be master and drop from training independent of performance on all other question in the module
a question be master and drop from multiplechoice training when the subject respond on three consecutive presentation of that question correctly and within second
when question be master they drop from training and do not appear in subsequent run
fillintheblank training
after the question of a module be master in multiplechoice format the same question be present again in successive run of randomly order fillintheblank question
the screen format of these question be identical to multiplechoice question except that a space blank line appear below the question instead of the four choice
student could use the alphanumeric key to type answer to these question
if the subject misspel a answer a misspelled message appear on screen
be consider incorrect
the message correct or incorrect appear on screen after correct or incorrect response respectively
as in multiplechoice module each question be master and drop from fillintheblank training when the subject respond on three consecutive presentation of that question correctly and within second
feedback and read and response time be the same as in multiplechoice training
paper pretest and posttests
prior to initiate and immediately after complete each module each subject complete a paper pretest and posttest respectively
the pretest and posttests be identical with matrix with the seven type of fact ie date enter union number county number park number forest state flower state bird and state tree serve as column heading and the name of the two state teach in the justcompleted module serve as row heading
the fourteen cell comprise the matrix be empty and have to be fill with the correct answer by the
experimental condition
every subject complete four training module and corresponding matrix pretest and posttests
each module represent a different experimental condition and differ in the number of fact present in each question box and the format of the question
three of the four module have explanation for incorrect response
the four experimental condition be preformatted table
the order of module be randomize for each subject
the fact about each of eight state be present in each of the four module format with different subject receive different module formatstate combination
result pretest to posttest gain
the primary result of interest be the performance on the paper pretest and posttests present before and after each module
figure show the mean pretest to posttest gain percentage correct on the posttest minus percentage correct on the pretest calculate for each subject separately for each of the four training condition preformatted table
the point within each bar represent individual subject value
repeated measure anova indicate a significant difference across condition f hoc comparison indicate that both the active onlysentence mean of gain and activeonlysentencewo explanation mean of gain condition be significantly great xxp than both the active passivesentence mean of gain and active passiveoutline mean of gain
no other difference be significant
the low case letter above each bar indicate which condition be significantly different from each other
condition that share a letter be not significantly different condition that do not have a letter in common be significantly different from each other
this lettering convention be use in subsequent figure
training minute

figure show the mean fact gain per minute of training calculate by the number correct on the posttest minus the number correct on the pretest divide by the number of minute spend in training
this provide a measure of training efficiency for each of the four training condition
repeated measure anova indicate a significant difference across condition f xxp 
tukey s post hoc comparison indicate that subject gain significantly xxp more fact per minute of training in the active passivesentence condition mean of fact gain per minute of training than in either the active onlysentence mean of fact gain per minute of training and active onlysentencewo explanation mean of fact gain per minute of training condition
no other difference be significant
discussion
student learn measurable response to every fact include in training than when require to make overt response to only a portion of the training fact
on the average student learn more than of the fact include in training when require to make overt response to every fact
alternatively student learn less than of the fact when only require to make overt response to one in seven fact include in training
the cost to double training completeness from to of the fact learn be to multiply training time by five
this be see in the dramatic difference in training time between the different training condition the module that include both active and passive fact require onefifth the time to complete approximately minute than those that include only active fact approximately minute
divide the number of fact gain from the pretest to the posttest by the number of minute spend in training figure provide a measure of training efficiency roughly speak how many fact do student learn for be qualify including both passive and active fact in train increased training efficiency
subject learn more fact per minute of training in one of the two condition that include passive fact active passivesentence condition than in the two condition that include only active fact
this effect on training efficiency of include passive fact in training be not so robust because the other condition that include passive fact active passiveoutline condition do not show statistically significant improved training efficiency over the two condition that include only active fact although the mean number of fact gain per minute of training be great in active passiveoutline condition than in the two condition that include only active fact
some of this increased training efficiency may have result from the fact that student learn some of the passive fact even though they be not require to make overt response to them
the two module that include passive fact require a overt response for only of the fact include and test in the module of the fact active passiveoutline or active passivesentence of the fact as measure by pretest to posttest gain figure 
as in programmed instruction eigen margulies doran holland holland these result suggest that computerbased training may be most effective when student be require to make overt response to all of the fact include in training
furthermore student may learn only a small percentage of fact for which overt response be not require
the above interpretation attribute the pretestposttest difference between active only and active passive module to the presence or absence of passive fact
although this interpretation be plausible it must be accept with some caution
in addition to differ on the presence or absence of passive fact the two type of module also differ in the number of question include per module active only module include question per module while active and passive module include only two question per module
thus it be possible that pretest to posttest module increase
this proposition require independent evaluation
present passive fact in outline as opposed to sentence form do not affect any of the measure
provide explanation for incorrect response do not appear to contribute to either train efficiency or effectiveness
the utility of these two feature be evaluate for restricted subject matter fact about state
perhaps these feature would prove more useful in the training of other subject matter
these feature should be evaluate in the training of different type of material before firm conclusion about their utility be reach
the result of this experiment suggest that there may be a advantage to include passive fact in training student may learn more fact for every training minute when passive fact be include in computerbased training screen
future research should conduct parametric analysis to determine if some ratio of passive to active fact include in computerbasedtraining module could retain the training efficiency advantage of passive fact without reduce training effectiveness
our major conclusion be that require a overt response for each fact double the amount learn at display fact in outline form produce no different effect than in sentence form and explanation of incorrect answer have no measured effect

the social skill training program
the program be of four week duration meet for two and a half hour per week and the training be cognitivebehavioral in nature
training involve criticism skill acquisition and challenging irrational or selfdefeating cognition
each of the five training group have two leader one male and one be a experienced mean year professional counselor and the other leader be a senior doctoral student in clinical psychology
complete detail of the training program be available in the training program manual piccinin mccarrey chislett

behavioral roleplay intercorrelation and factor analysis of the verbal and nonverbal behavior
it will be recall that there be six nonverbal variable six give criticism verbal variable and five receiving criticism verbal variable
intercorrelation be compute within these three set of variable follow by three factor analyse to determine the extent to which each rated behavior be independent
it be find that within each set of variable nonverbal verbal give criticism and verbal receiving criticism the correlation of each behavior with the global rating be quite high gt xxp lt 
one main factor emerge from each of the factor analysis
these global factor account for a average in excess of percent of the nonverbal verbal giving and verbal receiving variance
therefore it be decide to use only the three global behavioral rating in subsequent analysis rather than the seventeen individual variable rating
behavioral roleplay measure
no significant training program effect discussion
with respect to fear of negative evaluation both training program and control group feel less anxious at posttest
perhaps take the fne twice may have relieve some anxiety for both group and this may mask the effect of the training program in the short term
however at followup the training program group continue to maintain the gain whereas the control group do not
this may indicate a possible consolidation effect of training program on selfreported anxiety stem from negative regard of others
on the criticism concern measure the training program subject report fewer concern about givingreceiving criticism over time
however their concern be only significantly low than those of the control at posttest
the difference in the result on the fne and ccs may be understand in terms of the content of item in the questionnaire
while both scale have item relate to give and receive criticism the fne seem to be more concerned with fear stem from receive rather than give criticism and the ccs seem to have more item relate to the fear giving of criticism the selfesteem of the training program group continue to improve over time
however it be only significantly high than the control group at posttest
for selfesteem relate to the receiving of criticism we see a consolidation effect similar to fne result with respect to anticipated fear of negative evaluation
program impact on selfesteem relate to give criticism be not differential across training program versus control group in the long term despite initial posttest difference immediately after the program
inversely program impact on selfesteem receiving be only differential in the long term despite the absence of differential effect between training program versus control in the shortterm
give criticism involve take initiative the motivational proactive step to practice that skill
the program require the individual to give criticism through roleplay and homework assignment in the real world and then the sharing of these experience involve give criticism back in the training group
this may explain the more immediate posttest result
perhaps individual do not continue to practice this skill after program completion participant may not have receive enough reinforcement or incentive to continue incur the cost associate with give criticism
this may indicate the need for a booster session or some form of followup involve increased incentive to give criticism over the long term maddux norton stoltenberg 
individual need a sufficiently high level of perceived selfefficacy to maintain behavior bandura 
if a sense of selfefficacy be not maintain at a minimum level the subject will not maintain the effort to continue give criticism and to live with the accompanying risk of loss of social approval
it must be note that these participant all report rather high level of fear of negative evaluation
opportunity to practice skill in receive criticism after program completion be largely dictate by initiative of other people and could be more similar for both control and training program subject
perhaps the skill development give in the program combine with daily interaction with others provide sufficient opportunity to practice this skill
another explanation might be that the control subject use low the training program subject who at oneyear followup be compare their behavior to their own high standard of successful behavior
even improved behavior may not meet these high standard so that selfreported esteem in this area be equivalent across training program and control group
participation in the study by individual in the control group indicate high motivation because these individual receive no training or little obvious reinforcement for participation
since these individual be highly motivate they may have be involved in selfhelp program which result in their improved feeling relate to give and receive criticism
selfhelp program could have consist of selfcontracts which involve access material relate to give and receive criticism and practice the skill outline in these material
the result could be improved selfrating similar to the training program group
no significant difference be find on the behavioral role play
scrutiny of roleplay pretest mean indicate individual be already perform fairly well
this suggest program participant do not have a deficit but be rather inhibited by their irrational belief and high fear of negative evaluation
efficacious in reduce irrational belief in the shortterm and anxietyrelated to fear of negative evaluation in the long term
similarly selfesteem connect with give criticism be increase in short term while selfesteem connect with receive criticism be increase in the long term
the absence of long term effect in the context of selfesteem give criticism and irrational belief suggest the need for booster session for this more proactive behavior so that individual can maintain a sense of selfefficacy
future work in this area might give attention to individual have bona fide skill deficit reflect by deficient roleplay pretest score
for this to happen behavioral roleplay should be add to the selection criteria for program of this nature

critical flicker fusion threshold cfft and the difference between fusion and flicker threshold be examine in female and three male patient with primary degenerative dementia of the alzheimer s type pddat
the control group consist of age sex and occupational classmatched normal volunteer
patient have a mean age of year range diagnosis be base on dsmiiir criteria
the psychophysical method of limit be used to measure three ascending fusion and three descending flicker mean the average be the cfft
both the cfft and the flicker threshold be able to distinguish between patient and volunteer at a high level of statistical significance t df xxp lt and t df xxp lt respectively
sixtyfive percent of patient have cfft score below sd of the volunteer cfft mean and percent of patient have flicker threshold below sd of the volunteer flicker mean
the fusion threshold fusion threshold be significantly great than the flicker threshold in patient t df xxp lt 
one interpretation of the result in that patient with pddat have a significant reduction in the sensitivity of the central nervous system to suprathreshold flicker
accurate diagnosis of early pddat probable alzheimer s disease continue to remain one of the most difficult area in dementia research
the use of simple quantitative measure such as cfft may have a important role to play in the overall assessment of patient with pddat
introduction
the relationship between primary degenerative dementia of the alzheimer s type pddt and normal aging remain a controversial subject
copeland and giaquinto have argue that pddat and normal aging be separate entity but other worker have argue the opposite uren brayne calloway deary whalley 
however there be general agreement that the early phase of pddat be indistinguishable clinically and neuropsychologically from normal aging of the alzheimer s type may be a continuum with normal aging but in the early stage the difference be only quantitative uren 
quantitative measure which be able to distinguish between normal elderly subject and patient with pddat may contribute to the overall clinical and psychiatric assessment of borderline case particularly if assess longitudinally
research technique which be sensitive to central nervous system cns change with age would have the greatest chance of identify and quantify early change in patient with pddat
the measurement of critical flicker fusion threshold cfft have enjoy a long tradition in experimental physiology psychology and more recently psychopharmacology simonson brozek smith misiak ott kranda 
it be also well establish as a research technique in gerontological research mcfarland warren karis coleston hindmarch curran 
its use in psychiatry be relatively recent and have be largely confine to the investigation of antidepressant and antianxiety agent hindmarch alford hindmarch 
subthreshold intermittent light be perceive as flicker
if the frequency be gradually increase the flicker become gradually less distinct until flicker be no long perceive fusion threshold
alternatively if the flicker be suprathreshold and be gradually decrease a point be reach when flicker be just perceive flicker threshold
these be variation of the continuous method of limit woodworth schlosberg 
the mean of the fusion and flicker threshold be the cfft
the critical flicker fusion threshold can be regard as a functional measure of the cns
cerebral cortical activity can be influence by flickering light toman and the electroencephalograp eeg obtain from the occipital cortex have be show to be synchronous with the frequency of flicker walker woolf halstead case 
in addition the cfft have repeatedly be show to correlate with other objective measure of cns activity including the eeg grundstrom holmberg holmberg hansen grandjean baschera martin weber gortelmeyer wieman 
soininen find that slow of the occipital rhythm measure by the eeg be the best discriminator between patient and normal elderly subject
the measurement of cfft in demented patient have not previously be describe with the exception of tucker 
this be a small open study of eight patient response to hydergine be monitor by measurement of the cfft
although clinical improvement be correlate with a increase in the cfft patient number be small and the diagnosis of dementia lack rigor no detail of diagnostic criteria or assessment be give
the purpose of this study be to examine the clinical diagnostic utility of the cfft technique in delineate patient with pddt and control subject
as far as the author be aware such a comparison have not previously be report
this study also examine for the first time the relationship between fusion and flicker threshold in patient with patient be include in the study
their age range from to with a mean of year year
twentyfive patient live in residential home and one patient live at home care for by her family
patient be identify initially by consultation with general practitioner and by examination of case record with the gp consent
patient identify as possibly suffer from dementia as define by mclean receive a visit from a screening nurse who administer the abbreviated mental testamt hodkinson and the minimental state examination mmse folstein folstein mchugh to assess gross cognitive impairment
patient score seven or less on the amt andor or less on the mmse receive a diagnostic visit from a physician
patient satisfying dsmiiir criteria for pddat american psychiatric association be more fully evaluate by the study physician under the supervision of a consultant in the psychiatry of old age with a special interest in dementia
assessment
assessment include medical assessment of mental state physical examination including neurology neuropsychological assessment routine haematology and biochemistry thyroid function test plasma bfolate vdrl serum carotene urinalysis chest xray ecg and ct scan
patient with evidence of significant physical illness other psychiatric diagnosis including depression the secondary cause of dementia or take concomitant medication know to have cns activity be exclude
all patient be rate as mildmoderate american psychiatric association by the study physician
the majority be moderately impair
volunteer
twentysix age coleston hindmarch and intelligencematched misiak volunteer be include in the study age range mean year 
intelligence be indirectly assess by occupational class goldthorpe because of the difficulty of premorbid assessment of the patient group
all patient be nonsmoker but two volunteer smoke less than ten cigarette per day barlow baer 
all patient be nondrinker but four volunteer claim to drink u
however these volunteer report that they have drink no alcohol in the hour prior to testing hindmarch 
sex difference have not be systematically study but be control for as a precaution
where it be not possible to exactly match for occupational class patient be match with volunteer of low occupational class six volunteer
since the cfft be positively correlate with intelligence misiak this would decrease the possibility of identify a difference due to biased matching
two volunteer be of a high occupational class than patient but patient be exactly match for occupational class according to the definition describe by goldthorpe 
all volunteer live at home either alone or with their spouse andor family and be identify from two general practice in the leeds area uk
this be part of a general health screening program coordinate from st james s university hospital uk
assessment by the screening nurse and physician include general medical and psychiatric history including concomitant medication and alcohol and assessment of cognitive function use the amt hodkinson and mmse folstein et al 
all volunteer be judge to be cognitively normal by the study psychologist and those with significant physical or psychiatric illness or receive concomitant medication with cns activity be exclude from the study
material
all assessment be carry out in patient and volunteer normal surroundings ie homeresidential home
assessment be make between and hour to control for possible circadian variation hindmarch 
other author have find no effect of time of day hett dewar jones tiplady 
the cfft be measure use four red lightemitting diode in binocular foveal fixation at m use a toolong test apparatus the leeds psychomotor tester model number zak d
the continuous psychophysical method of limit be use to determine both the fusion and flicker threshold woodworth schlosberg 
bright direct sunlight and poor ambient illumination be avoid
provided very little effect on the cfft simonson brozek 
a standardized set of instruction be use to explain the procedure
a relaxed attitude to the test be foster especially in the demented patient
result be more reliable if the task be not perceive as a performance test clark if a relaxed attitude be encourage goldstone and if standardized instruction be use huneke 
in the ascending mode flicker be increase from hz at hzs
subject be require to press a button when flicker appear to cease

discussion
critical flicker fusion threshold measurement have receive considerable attention from psychopharmacologist in recent year but the technique have not be investigate in patient with pddat
in a previous study of normal elderly volunteer curran wattis shillingford and hindmarch demonstrate a tendency of the cfft to decrease with increasing age but this fail to reach significance
in the same study the difference between fusion and flicker threshold be find to be negatively and significantly correlate with age
this reduction be due almost entirely to a fall in the flicker threshold and may reflect a reduction of the cns to suprathreshold flicker with increasing age
if pddat be a exaggeration of the normal aging process one would predict low cfft value in demented patient compare this have be clearly demonstrate
one would also predict that the reduction of the flicker threshold see in normal elderly subject with increasing age would be exaggerate far result in the fusion threshold be great than the flicker threshold
this have also be clearly demonstrate in demented patient
in normal volunteer the flicker threshold be great than the fusion threshold but with increasing age the flicker threshold tend to decrease with little or no change in the fusion threshold curran et al 
in demented patient this relationship be reverse the fusion threshold be great than the flicker threshold
the cfft have be clearly demonstrate to be significantly low in demented patient compare with normal volunteer
it could be account for by a specific reduction of the flicker threshold so that the cfft in the patient group be low than the volunteer group cfft
alternatively both the fusion and flicker threshold could decrease simultaneously so that the resultant cfft be low than the volunteer cfft
the result from this study clearly demonstrate that group and the volunteer group whereas the flicker threshold be significantly different in the two group
the demented patient have significantly low flicker threshold than their age sex and occupational classmatched counterpart
the reduction of cfft score in demented patient be account for by a reduction of flicker score
one interpretation of this be that in patient with pddat there be a large reduction in the sensitivity of the cns to suprathreshold flicker
this be observe as a trend in normal elderly subject the degree of reduction in flicker threshold be great with increasing age
the influence of increased reaction time in demented patient pirozzolo christensen ogle hansch thompson and shift in the response criteria be unlikely to be alternative explanation
one would expect these to influence the flicker and fusion threshold equally
the result be consistent with pddat be a exaggeration of the normal aging process at least as far as sensitivity to suprathreshold flicker be concerned
measurement of cfft be a simple and quick technique environment in contrast to other functional measure such as the eeg and positron emission tomography
these be not only considerably more expensive but take more time to complete require skilled personnel and be not available to the vast majority of patient especially those with borderline dementia
like other neuropsychological and clinical measure there be some overlap with normal elderly subject
the measurement of cfft and flicker threshold may be particularly useful for longitudinal assessment of borderline case of pddat
under these circumstance the ability of cfft and flicker threshold to predict outcome could be evaluate
choice of unit of analysis be a critical problem in evaluate environmental assessment item
the ecological fallacy involve interpret result base on ecological entity such as environmental setting as apply to individual
a less familiar error the individual difference fallacy involve interpret result base on individual as apply to setting
although this second error have be ubiquitous little be know about the empirical consequence of use different unit of analysis in item analysis
this study examine this issue when the unit be individual observe setting or artificial or random setting
neither item validities base on individual nor item validities base on setting yield unequivocal result
however a measure develop specifically for environmental research the splitsample correlation appear useful for identify environmental item
researcher construct environmental assessment scale should select item with both high splitsample correlation and high settinglevel item validities
the ecological perspective in psychology barker bronfenbrenner stern willems assume that the attribute of environmental setting influence or indeed constrain or determine a wide variety of cognitive affective and behavioral response
consequently researcher from this perspective have explore a number of approach to assess the characteristic of environmental setting astin holland barker craik feimer holland moos pace richards stern 
such environmental assessment involve a number of relatively unique psychometric problem craik feimer pace 
the present study address one such problem the choice of proper unit of analysis
for many year behavioral scientist have be aware of the ecological fallacy robinson the error of interpret variation among ecological unit such as environmental setting as though it apply to variation among individual
it be equally erroneous however to interpret variation among pace richards 
a recent theoretical paper richards suggest this error which have be ubiquitous in previous research on environment gottfredson hybl gottfredson casteneda be label the individual difference fallacy
a common approach to the construction of environmental assessment scale be to use question about the environment that be similar to the question typically use in objective personality test pace stern moos 
the individual difference fallacy be likely to be a especially serious problem for such scale because the item could function as a disguised measure of personality or other psychological characteristic of individual rather than a true environmental measure
accordingly richards use hypothetical data to argue that no analysis use individual as the unit be capable of distinguish between a valid environmental measure and a disguised test of personality
only analysis use environmental setting as the unit could make this distinction
a empirical study richards confirm these theoretical finding but reveal additional complexity
the data be base on individual in environmental setting classroom who respond to six environmental scale
data also be sort randomly into artificial setting of the same size as the observed setting
these random setting approximate a situation in which the scale be a pure disguised test of personality
in addition to individual and set level alpha the scale reliability be assess by a special index richards the splitsample correlation that be design specifically to address the unique problem of environmental measurement
the splitsample correlation be a analog of a splithalf test reliability base on odd item vs even item
to compute one assign number from to xxn to the individual within each setting and compute two summary score for that setting one base on individual assign odd number and the other on individual assign even number then summary score be correlate across environmental setting
alpha coefficient base on individual as the unit of analysis necessarily from observed or random setting confirm that no individual level analysis can throw any light at all on the setting level reliability of environmental assessment scale
the setting level alpha for observed setting be quite substantial but so be the alpha for random setting
thus a standard reliability analysis with setting as the unit also may not distinguish clearly between a valid environmental measure and a disguised measure of personality
the splitsample correlation however be high for observed setting but low for random setting
thus only a index develop specifically for environmental research yield unequivocal result
the present paper extend these argument to the context of item statistics and item analysis
the analysis report here emphasize a traditional index of item validity the adjusted partwhole correlation
however the same point would apply to item characteristic curve in the context of item response theory lord 
method
sample of individual and setting
the data for this study like the data for the scale reliability study richards reduce disorderly behavior in charleston south carolina middle ie junior high school gottfredson gottfredson karweit gottfredson 
specifically the analysis for this study be base on separate assessment of classroom the environmental setting by middle school student the individual
although some student may have assess more than one classroom the set of individual assess the various classroom be essentially independent
only classroom with at least respondent be deem eligible for this study
the number of respondent within classroom vary from to with a mean of a standard deviation of and a median of 
the number for both individual assessment and for environmental setting be large enough to provide highly stable estimate of item statistics
environmental assessment item
analysis be base on student response to abbreviated fouritem version of six of the classroom environment scale develop by moos trickett 
therefore the total number of item be 
moos and consist of truefalse question about the characteristic of the classroom
the following specific scale be include involvement affiliation teacher support task orientation order and organization rule clarity
unit of analysis
the psychometric property of the item in these six scale be examine for three different unit of analysis
first individual ie the student assessment be use as the unit of analysis
for this analysis each item be score or with be assign to the response associate with high standing on the characteristic imply by the scale title
second observe environmental setting ie the classroom be use as the unit of analysis
the summary score for each observed setting or classroom or each item be the mean of the item score for student in that classroom
because the item score be score or these set summary score can be interpret as the probability that a individual in that setting would respond artificial or randomize setting be use as unit of analysis
these setting be construct by sort the individual assessment into a random order and then divide them into group with the same number of subject as the observed classroom
the summary score for each artificial setting on each item be the mean of the item score for individual randomly assign to it
statistical analysis
the first step in the statistical analysis be to compute the adjusted partwhole correlation coefficient or item validity between each item and total score on the scale of which it be a part
the adjustment eliminate the contribution of the item itself to the total score so each adjusted correlation be mathematically equivalent to the zeroorder correlation between the item in question and the total of the other three item in its scale
therefore statistical test for zero order correlation be apply to these coefficient
the reliability procedure include in the spssx statistical package spss be use in compute these correlation
in addition the splitsample correlation richards be compute for each item
splitsample correlation for item directly address the central issue of whether or not different individual agree about the characteristic of given setting on given item
result
table summarize the statistics for individual item
because the number of individual and setting be relatively large even rather small correlation be nominally significant
accordingly the absolute magnitude of the various statistics appear more relevant than their significance level and table summarize the central tendency and dispersion of the various statistics across the item
the mean in table for each statistic except the splitsample correlation for random setting would be significant beyond the level if it be a zeroorder correlation base on the number of individual and setting for this study
the average adjust partwhole correlation for individual be typical for item analysis research but necessarily be identical whether the individual come from the observed setting or from the random setting
this fact provide confirmation that item analysis use individual item measure the characteristic of setting and item measure the characteristic of individual
the average partwhole correlation for observed setting be both fairly high and somewhat high than the individual level correlation
at first glance this result would seem to indicate that to some degree these item be measure the characteristic of setting
surprisingly however the average partwhole item correlation for random setting also be fairly high and of approximately the same magnitude as the correlation for individual
it be unclear why this be the case for theoretically this correlation should be close to zero richards f test at the scale level confirm the adequacy of the randomization richards 
one possible explanation be that randomization do not absolutely equate setting but merely insure that only chance difference persist
therefore the correlation for random setting will approximate the correlation for randomly choose individual
whatever the explanation these result clearly indicate that set level partwhole correlation also can not distinguish unequivocally between item measure setting characteristic and item measure setting be fairly substantial however a clear indication that to some degree these item be measure setting characteristic
more important the average splitsample correlation for random setting be low
thus the splitsample correlation which be design specifically for environmental measure appear capable of distinguishing item which at least in part be measure setting characteristic from item measure only individual difference
at the same time both theoretical consideration richards and the typical property of ecological correlation robinson suggest that the splitsample correlation for item that be measure only set characteristic should be high than the correlation obtain in this study
indeed the splitsample correlation should be for a pure environmental item with no measurement error richards 
the relatively low value obtain here suggest that while these item be to a degree measure the characteristic of setting to a equal or large degree they be measure the characteristic of individual
this conclusion be support by the result obtain previously at
the result confirm the result of a early study of scale reliability richards and suggest that substantial change be need in the itemselection procedure typically use to construct environmental assessment scale
the typical procedure have be to select item on the basis of item statistics for individual frequently individual within a single setting
this procedure not only be incapable of identify item that measure the characteristic of environmental setting but also be virtually guarantee to select item that largely or entirely measure individual difference
therefore item analysis base on individual should be eschew in future environmental research even as a first step and report base on such analysis should no long be welcome in scientific journal
even in the initial stage of scale construction environmental setting should be the unit of analysis in computing item statistics including item characteristic curve
moreover the number of setting must be relatively large perhaps as large as the minimum number of individual need for a conventional item analysis
thus future research aim at more complex and more expensive than have be customary
consequently such research will be more difficult
this great difficulty appear to be the necessary price of obtain scale that measure environmental characteristic however and researcher should not allow such difficulty to deter them from use the proper unit of analysis
it will not be sufficient however simply to select item on the basis of adjusted partwhole correlation with environmental setting as the unit of analysis
such correlation will be substantial for item that measure environmental characteristic but they also can be substantial for item that reflect only individual difference
the itemlevel splitsample correlation be need to distinguish between these two kind of item
in construct environmental scale therefore researcher should select item that have both a high setting level partwhole correlation and a high splitsample correlation preferably high than the splitsample correlation obtain here
because item have never be select in this way no information currently be available that would guide researcher in construct such item
as experience accumulate with possible to identify in advance the type of item most likely to meet both selection criteria
it then would become easy to construct environmental assessment scale that minimize individual difference contamination
this study seek to determine whether or not a disease prevention program might have a negative impact on attitude towards disease victim
knowledge of and attitude towards aids and several other serious disease be assess before and after college student view a filmed educational program on aids
result show that compare to a control group participant who have see the aids film report significantly great fear and dislike of a hypothetical aids patient
the film also significantly enhanced participant perception that aids be a preventable disease
result be discuss in terms of the possibility that healtheducation program emphasize preventability may inadvertently increase people tendency to blame the victim
diseaseprevention program be design to inform people about the cause and course of a disease motivate them to adopt diseaseprevention behavior and teach them prevention skill somers 
the question of whether or not such program also alter reaction towards victim of the disease be generally not address when program be evaluate
from the standpoint of disease sufferer this may be a adverse impact on societal attitude towards victim can such a effect reduce the quality of social support they receive
a substantial literature attest to the fact that the social environment in general and social support in particular can influence personal health
the protective effect of social support have be demonstrate for several health outcome including mortality and the development of chronic disease broadhead et al 
social support have also be find to play a important role in a person s ability to cope with and survive cancer bloom funch marshall lichtman taylor heart disease mallick ruberman weinblatt goldberg chaudhary diabetes heitzman kaplan as well as other disease see dimatteo hays dimond maybury brewin 
give the potential impact that social support have on one s ability to cope with a serious illness it to a reduction in that support
attitude towards the victim of disease comprise one such factor in that if one hold a negative attitude toward sufferer of a particular disease that negativity will probably color hisher interaction with the sufferer
those with a serious illness often find negative social reaction to be as difficult to cope with as the illness itself wortman dunkelschetter 
diseaseprevention program which by their very nature seek to instill in the audience a sense of control and responsibility may unintentionally produce a negative shift in attitude towards disease victim
by increasing belief that most of the responsibility for diseaseprevention rest with the individual such program might increase one s tendency to blame and derogate the victim of disease
one might infer a character flaw to exist in a person who could have act to prevent a serious disease yet fail to do so
in fact previous study have show that victim of preventable disease receive more derogation than victim of unpreventable one katz hass parisi gruman 
the present study seek to explore the hypothesis that a health education program which emphasize the preventability of a disease may increase people negative evaluation of a person suffer from that disease
specifically participant evaluate a aids victim before and after view a popular madefortv aids education program
method participant
thirtynine university undergraduate female and male with a average age of year participate in this study for which they earn extra course credit
procedure
participant who agree to take part in what be describe as a study of health attitude be ask to read a one page interview in which a person with aids disclose personal feeling about have the disease see table for excerpt
after read the interview participant be ask to record their impression of the aids patient on a impression rating scale irs
participant also report their belief about aids and several other disease on the health belief questionnaire hbq a scale design by the author for us week after complete these questionnaire half of the participant watch a aids education film produce for the home box office cable television network and narrate by former us surgeon general c everett koop
the film answer common question concerning the transmission of aids and emphasize the step one should follow to prevent contracting aids
follow the film participant who view the film as well as those in the control group again complete the irs and hbq
each phase of the study be present to participant as a separate investigation in the hope that participant would remain unaware of the experimenter hypothesis
the fact that several of the questionnaire deal with a broad spectrum of disease help to make the separate study cover study plausible
questionnaire
the impression rating scale irs ask participant to indicate how much they like enjoy fear would avoid be make to feel uncomfortable or awkward by feel saddened or embarrass by etc the stimulus person

the health belief questionnaire hbq be design to assess a person s perception of the preventability prognosis contagiousness social cost and economic cost of a variety of disease eg aids cancer diabetes heart disease etc
""
for example one item ask how preventable be aids that is to what extent can individual take action exercise diet avoid certain activitieschemical agent etc that will keep them from get the disease the same question be ask for ten other disease
participant rate each item use a fivepoint likerttype scale where no or not at all and almost always or extremely
result
result of a principal component factor analysis with a varimax rotation be use to combine several of the item on the irs into a index
specifically inspire kind friendly enjoyable or interest the aids patient be along with six item reflect the participant desire to help support and be with the patient load at or high on a factor account for of the total irs variance
all thirteen of these be sum to form a overall positivity rating
in this way a positivity rating for both pre and postfilm be obtain for both group
several item on the irs with particular relevance to the hypothesis eg how afraid the patient make you feel how much you would tend to avoid the patient be analyze separately
the only hbq item include in the analysis be one assess the perceived preventability of aids
change score be obtain for all dependent variable of interest by subtract the postfilm score from prefilm score
these change score be analyze in a series of oneway anova see table 
film viewer as compare to the control group rate the aids patient less xxp lt 
those who see the aids film also report feel more afraid of the aids patient than the control group f xxp lt 
finally the film have the desired effect of make viewer feel that aids be a preventable disease
those who see the film compare to those who do not perceive aids as be significantly more preventable at posttesting f xxp lt 
discussion
finding in this study support the notion that diseaseprevention program may inadvertently do a disservice to the victim of disease
specifically while the film have the intended effect of make participant view aids as more preventable it also increase their tendency to fear and derogate a victim of aids
while the finding suggest that it may be the perception of aids preventability that mediate the derogation of the victim no direct test of this be make in the current study
additional research be need to determine which facet of diseaseprevention program may have the
it be also interesting to note that those who do not see the film feel substantially more positive towards the aids patient at the posttest period suggest that in the absence of the film information repeat exposure increase rather than decreased positive feeling
since social support may enhance a person s ability to cope with and survive a serious illness and since such support may depend on societal attitude towards disease victim the implication of these result be grave indeed
however several caution be warrant in interpret these finding
first one must keep in mind that participant react to a hypothetical aids patient
future research might explore the generalizability of these finding to the evaluation of real aids patient
second because the study be limit to a small sample of undergraduate student the result may not be representative of the general population
far test with more diverse group be necessary before undue confidence be place in these finding
finally only one diseaseprevention program and one disease be test
represent a general phenomenon or one that be idiosyncratic in nature a variety of disease and program should be evaluate
despite its limitation the study should alert those responsible for design healtheducation program that their best intention may sometimes go awry
while such program may be successful in protect healthy individual they may also have the undesirable consequence of increase the burden of cope for those who suffer
the frequency with which verbal uncertainty expression be employ suggest that they play a important role in the communication of state of uncertainty and may have a important role in emerging technology such as expert system
this article critically review empirical study of verbal uncertainty expression span two decade of research between and with the principal conclusion that people be highly internally consistent in their use of verbal uncertainty expression no conclusion about betweensubject variability be justify principally because a there be currently no consensus as to what be to count as consistent or inconsistent use and b there be several factor that confound purported analysis of betweensubject consistency such as the composition of the stimulus set and the scaling task themselves one study suggest that assessment of the meaning of verbal uncertainty expression may be condition by the prior perceived probability of the event they describe
however other interpretation of this study be open
the review also discuss the more general epistemological question of whether be really amenable to the unidimensional framework within which empirical study have be conceive
one of the most salient feature of uncertainty be that people including expert in many field frequently communicate aspect or degree of uncertainty by the use of verbal expression such as possible probable likely very likely highly likely and so on
the following abstract from the protocol of a medical expert diagnose abnormality of the cardiovascular system provide a illustration of the use of such expression for denote both absolute and relative state of uncertainty
there be also a unusual shadow see in the right side represent very likely a anomalously course pulmonary vein a diagnosis outside of total anomalous connection be unlikely even though the av canal be a remote possibility this pulse rate be highly unlikely if that patient have congestive heart failure it be unlikely that this be a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection below the diaphram to the inferior vena cava as be see with the total anomalous connection to the portal venous system this be most likely a prominent tricuspid closure sound suggest the possibility of right ventricular hypertension the second hunch be a atrial septal defect of the primum type with a small righttoleft shunt which be either due to a anomaly to the av canal or even less likely due to pulmonary vascular disease my hunch at this point be a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection either to the vertical vein or to the azygous vein
much less likely be a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection to the inferior vena cava with scimitar syndrome johnson et al emphasis add
uncertainty have be highlight by a number of expert system that have employ verbal uncertainty expression to communicate aspect or degree of belief to the user fox et al van melle bonissone et al 
with the exception of fox a these treat verbal uncertainty expression either as probability value probability range fuzzy probability bonissone et al for example communicate uncertainty to the user use set of linguistic uncertainty term define as trapezoidal highly regular fuzzy membership function on the unit probability interval
one such set base on the result of beythmaron and the associated fuzzy parameter be show in table 
in the context of decision technology such as expert system the frequency and naturalness of verbal uncertainty expression suggest that they may provide a graceful interface for communicating uncertainty to system user
however the question of their appropriateness in interface design be dependent upon a clear account of their use particularly factor such as withinsubject variability betweensubject variability and context specificity of meaning
if people be not internally consistent in the meaning they assign to verbal uncertainty expression or if betweensubject variability be high at the appropriate level of resolution then attempt to incorporate verbal uncertainty expression into a interface will be unsuccessful
moreover if the meaning of verbal uncertainty term be find to be dependent upon contextual knowledge and a model of how it affect the meaning of verbal uncertainty expression to use them appropriately
finally if verbal uncertainty expression be to be model as probability value range or fuzzy subset of the unit probability interval then it must be establish that the semantics of the expression employ permit unidimensional mapping
treat nonunidimensional object as unidimensional would force them into a semantic straight jacket that may both ignore the richness of the information they convey and lead to communication error
in short a comprehensive account of the use of verbal uncertainty expression be a prerequisite for successful application in expert system and other technology
review of experimental study
many experimental study have investigate the use of verbal uncertainty expression use a number of direct and indirect scaling procedure
the principal area of investigation have be between and withinsubject variability and context dependency
these and the issue of semantics or unidimensionality be the focus of the following review which describe and critically assess the methodology and interpretation of eleven paper span newman 
lichtenstein and newman have subject assign numerical value between to to verbal expression table 
these result lead the author to three observation firstly the degree of qualification of adverbial modifier be symmetrical between likely and unlikely
the order be very gt quite gt no adverb gt rather gt fairly gt somewhat secondly subadditivity be observe between the mean value assign to of the set of symmetric pair where a symmetric pair be define as a expression and its affixal negation eg the mean value assign to quite likely be while the mean value assign to quite unlikely be make a total of 
finally with the exception of the expression tossup the range of subject assignment be great for expression nearer the center of the distribution than the extreme
result be also interpret as give
assessment
the principal limitation of this study be the choice of stimulus many of the expression have a distinctly frequentistic rather than uncertaintybased meaning eg usually rare seldom and slightly moreless than half the time
moreover expression such as fair chance and good chance appear to confound measure of uncertainty with other situational feature ie may be a good chance when the prior probability be low or the outcome favorable but a poor chance if the prior be high or the outcome undesirable
finally it be questionable whether expression such as inconclusive can be give a unidimensional interpretation and the adverb rather in isolation be ambiguous
johnson 
johnson investigate the effect of context and group membership on direct estimate for verbal uncertainty expression table 
subject be either college student or image interpreter in the us army
the expression be factorially combine with three context relate to the satellite photograph and present in a item booklet
analysis of variance show no significant effect for subject group or context demonstrate that individual be consistent in their assignment across context though possibly because of memory of prior assignment or simple replication
the mean standard deviation of assignment across subject compute across phrase be 
this account for of the total variance while difference between phrase account for over suggest that the former be trivial relative to the latter
on the basis of these result johnson assert that personnel involved in the production and use of intelligence should be extremely wary of attempt to infer value from qualitative expression of uncertainty xxp vi
however this do not seem to follow from the data he present
bryant and norman 
bryant and norman have physician estimate the likelihood of disease given that it be denote by each of expression table on two occasion by select a probability value from correlation of estimate between the two administration be high xxr indicate low withinsubject variability
in general however betweensubject range be find to be high and only nine expression have range of less than 
two expression never and effectively exclude have range great than with bimodal distribution of assignment indicate either ambiguity in their meaning or measurement error
this result in never have a high mean than some expression clearly less qualifying ie doubtful and unlikely
assessment
with the exception of low withinsubject variability it be difficult to draw unequivocal conclusion from this study primarily because many of the term do not relate directly to uncertainty reflect either logical relation be consistent with be compatible with effectively exclude can not be exclude frequentistic consideration never always sometimes virtually always utility pathognomonic classic normally
assign probability to essentially nonprobabilistic expression will result in high variability between assignment or more generally attempt to scale stimulus on nonstimuli dimension will lead to large variability in the value record
finally range statistics can not be used to measure intersubject variability because they be affect by artefact such as the presence of outlier and measurement error range say little about the average difference between individual
reyna 
reyna investigate the scaling property of modal quantifier table and affixal impossible uncertain etc and lexical not possible not certain etc negation use three scaling task unconstrained sorting rank and direct estimation to determine the subjective dimensionality of this set of expression and the specific effect of the two type of negation in two study result of a first study be replicate and extend in a second study consequently the former study sentence of the form it be x it will happen print on piece of card where x be constitute by one of the experimental expression
the subject first sort the set of sentence into a unconstrained number of group base on similarity and then rank them according to the degree that it will happen be true
finally the following day subject assign percentage probability to each phrase
the incidence matrix derive from the sorting data be analyze use the multidimensional scaling program torsca
this produce a dimensional solution with a normalized stress value of 
the order of expression along this dimension correlate well with both the median position in the ranking task spearman s xxr xxp lt and median assign probability spearman s xxr xxp lt 
these be also highly intercorrelated spearman s xxr xxp lt see table 
for the probability assignment data there be significant rank correlation between affirmative expression xxp lt and lexical negation spearman s xxr xxp lt 
affixal negation however be typically assign low value in the probability assignment task than be the corresponding lexical negation though the mean difference between median value be small 
for the partition data no such pattern emerge
therefore this difference can not be describe as reliable
reyna interpret these result as indicate firstly that modal adjective be internally represent in terms of degree along a unidimensional scale of quantification xxp secondly that the effect of negation be subtractive rather than multiplicative and thirdly that affixal negation be more qualifying than lexical negation
as suggest above evidence for the latter conclusion be weak
it be also interesting to note that the similarity between affixal and lexical negation suggest by reyna s data be very different from that envisage by zadeh 
he see the two type of negation as have very different not likely be minus the membership function for likely while the membership function for unlikely be the reflection of the membership function of likely in the line xxp 
assessment
reyna s conclusion be open to question on both methodological and theoretical ground
methodologically the use of incidence as a measure of cooccurrence be open to criticism as it ignore much of the information available in the partition and other measure have be show to produce better solution burton coxon jones coxon 
from a theoretical perspective correlation of dimension position and median probability estimate do not demonstrate conclusively that uncertainty as manifest by the expression employ in this study be cognitively represent as a unidimensional scale since the same factor may underlie performance in each scaling task
it be true that a unidimensionality hypothesis would predict the obtain result but it be also clear that these can equally well be interpret as show that the cognitive process underlie the various finally as budescu and wallsten point out reyna give no indication of the proportion of individual subject whose ranking conform to the pattern of group median
they find that the mean intrasubject correlation between rank for affirmative and negative expression be only somewhat question rayna s subtractive proposal
beythmarom 
beythmarom set out to assess the importance of contextual information to the meaning of verbal uncertainty expression by compare the probability assignment of israeli political forecaster in three task
in the first task subject assign numerical value to each of expression
in the second task they first rank the expression into a unconstrained number of category and then assign a probability to each category
in the third task subject assign percentage probability to a subset of the expression as they appear in official publication of their host organization
a example of the latter be the outbreak of hostile activity be most probable
""
the first two task be classify as context
a number of space activity be administer between task for temporal separation
the expression employ in this study translate from hebrew by beythmarom be rank according to mean assignment in table 
in the undefined context condition all withinsubject difference between assignment in both task be less than 
with respect to betweensubject variability the mean interquartile range iqr of subject assignment for the expression be and the mean range be 
the range in the in context task be find to be high for all expression with the exception of likely in the undefined context task
beythmarom interpret these result as show low withinsubject variability but high betweensubject variability
that is there be considerable disagreement in the interpretation of most verbal probability expression as evidence by the large range of number give to each expression xxp and the reported result should convince any forecast organization to change its policy and to use xxp 
it be also suggest that subject assignment could be roughly partition into seven category as show in table though this partition be rather ad hoc
the result of this study be employ by bonissone et al
 in the development of rum describe above
assessment
there be a number of caveat to interpretation of data from the in context task
firstly as beythmarom point out subject deep involvement with the event describe may have encourage personal assessment of the probability of the event themselves rather than the independent meaning of the uncertainty expression
since assessment of the likelihood of the event will vary the effect would be to increase the apparent variability of the value assign
personal assessment may in turn be influence by a host of other factor such as perceived desirability slovic 
secondly event may not have be clearly define
in the example above hostile activity be ambiguous
both might be construe as hostile activity though their prior probability be clearly different
if subject use perception of prior to condition their judgment then different interpretation of the nature of the event itself will have the effect of increase the apparent range of assigned probability
these factor confound measurement of variability of the numerical estimate in the in context task make comparison with range for the other task unreliable
a final methodological point be that too much store be put upon the range as a measure of dispersion among subject
the appendix show that assume beythmarom s data be approximately normally distribute a assumption support by the data appendix the average disparity between numerical assignment for a given expression for any pair of speaker will be close to the iqr standard deviation
for normally distribute data this be about half the range
thus the range overestimate the average disparity that would occur between any pair of speaker
with respect to the stimulus one must consider one can nt rule it out entirely and not inevitable indicate a nonzero probability but little else
if this be the case then unidimensional scaling will lead to large range estimate for these expression
other stimulus expression be also problematic it be arguable that meaningful chance connote aspect of value and expectation rather than just uncertainty and comparative expression such as most likely can not validly be assign absolute probability
in a large set of mutually exclusive hypothesis the most likely hypothesis may be unlikely
finally expression such as one should assume and reasonable to assume say little about the degree of confidence of the event describe
make assumption be a radically different way of deal with uncertainty than be propagate probability cohen 
as with other nonunidimensional stimulus unidimensional scaling will lead to large variance in the value assign
zimmer 
zimmer compare the use of numerical and verbal estimate of uncertainty the cognitive representation of the expected frequency of uncertain event be code in a verbal propositional mode
this he claim mean that require people to give numerical estimate of uncertainty will interfere with the native representation more than would the provision of verbal estimate
thus human subject be more effective at reason with verbal expression than with numerical expression even if the task perform rely on frequency information zimmer xxp 
to directly compare verbal and numerical estimate of uncertainty it be necessary either to measure the two on some external criteria or to provide some direct mapping between the two
for the purpose of comparison zimmer treat the verbal uncertainty term as possibility function on the unit probability interval and operationalize the specific meaning of each expression as the median point within each possibility function
in his study subject first generate a scale of verbal uncertainty expression in a unspecified task
next idealize noiseless trapezoidal possibility function be determine use a modified robbinsmonro whose proportion vary between and zimmer xxp 
finally median value of these distribution be compute
the mean number of expression produce be 
a scale elicit in this manner be present in table 
the scale be highly discrete and a incomplete range 
scale value such as these be employ in three study a calibration study study i a bayesian revision study study ii and a applied prediction study study iii
study i
in the first study zimmer have west german soldier give verbal estimate of confidence to each of their answer in a item open response political science questionnaire
plot accuracy as a function of confidence ie the numerical value associate with the verbal expression produce a set of point that cluster around the identity line imply that subject be well calibrate see chapter 
this contrast with the large number of study employ numerical confidence measure that have show overconfidence there be several problem with this study
firstly it be not adequately control eg there be no numerical group make betweenstudy comparison dubious
secondly result may be a artefact of the limited range of the scale
in the above scale for example the maximum possible confidence would be this severely constrain the degree of overconfidence possible
indeed it have be show that a large proportion of the overconfidence typically observe in calibration study derive from trial on which subject assert confidence in their answerspredictions fischhoff and macgregor keren 
study ii
in a second study zimmer employ a bayesian revision task similar to the book bag and poker chip experiment carry out by phillips and edwards 
in these experiment subject be require to estimate the probability that a particular book bag of poker chip be be sample given information concerning the number of possible book bag base rate the color composition of the poker chip in each bag s subject have a similar task but employ verbal uncertainty expression to denote their probability
in contrast to the finding of conservativism by phillips and edwards zimmer find that subject who employ verbal expression be less conservative accuracy ratio vary between and after trial than subject in other study who employ numerical expression accuracy ratio vary between and 
on the basis of this zimmer conclude that the so called conservativism in information processing be mainly due to a conservative handling of number and computation and be not necessarily due to a biased processing procedure zimmer xxp 
assessment
apart from the lack of a control group the principal problem with this study be the discrete nature of the response scale combine with task demand to adjust response as information be accumulate
this suggest that zimmer s subject give verbal estimate be force to adjust their estimate in great step size than would subject use a continuous numerical response mode give the impression of utilize
as a illustration the scale provide by zimmer table have a mean interval of 
if subject employ this scale adjust their estimate after each successive datum the mean change will be 
subject use a continuous numerical scale might likewise adjust but in small step
this would result in subject in the verbal condition be less conservative
thus the apparent reduction in conservativism may be a artefact of the highly discrete nature of the numerical scale to which the verbal expression be transform rather than some facilitation of cognitive processing
it should also be note that zimmer make the error of miscomparing result from the phillips and edwards study with his own data
phillips and edwards plot likelihood ratio as a function of favorable minus unfavorable sample zimmer however plot likelihood ratio as a function of trial
this confound comparison between the study
study iii
in a third study bank clerk be ask to predict the exchange rate between the us dollar and the deutschmark four week later
twelve they would talk to a client whereas the others be ask to give numerical estimate in terms of percentage of change
the first group be find to be more correct and more internally consistent though zimmer do not report the precise measure use
analysis of verbal protocol show that whereas the numerical group rely on variable that be usually state numerically eg gnp in derive its prediction the verbal group employ both these and qualitative variable such as the stability of the german government suggest that the superior performance of the verbal group be cause by its use of a broad knowledge base
the paucity of experimental information provide make it difficult to discuss methodological aspect of this experiment
general discussion
on theoretical ground zimmer s explanation of the putative improvement in performance as a result of employ verbal uncertainty expression be weak
in particular research have show that the critical factor affect quality of calibration be quantity of experience with immediate feedback on the relevant task keren mental model of the task and the development of welltuned procedure for generating uncertainty estimate
it be difficult to envisage how elicitation of verbal response in isolation might produce a similar effect
similarly in the bayesian revision task it be difficult to envisage how employing a verbal response scale per se might induce normative behavior in a task for which extensive numerical calculation of conditional probability would be require for normative performance
likewise for the third experiment why should the requirement to give a percentage estimate cause subject to sample a small knowledge base budescu and wallsten 
the aim of the study conduct by budescu and wallsten be to determine whether apparent betweensubject difference in the rank ordering of verbal uncertainty term be the result of withinsubject variability
that is do the observed difference really derive from individual difference or be they just the effect of take a crosssection of individual variability over time
thirtytwo subject rank order and make pair comparison between expression table which be high than chance h or low than chance l
the total number of pair comparison make by each subject be reduce by separate the expression into two sublists each of consist of the anchor high than chance and low than chance expression and then excluding the more distant comparison ie between h and l expression between always and l expression between never and h expression and between never and always
no symmetric expression eg likely and unlikely appear in the same list
the study consist of three replication separate by interval of three week
each replication be compose of a pair comparison task and either a ranking or a estimation task
the pair comparison task be identical on all three occasion half the subject receive each sublist
for the rankingestimation task subject be require in replication to rank the expression in ascending order in and in replication to provide both a best numerical estimate of the probability represent by the expression and low and upper limit of this value
for analysis probability value and the midpoint of the low and upper bound be convert to rank
this produce a total of four rank order for each subject
a comparison of mean rank from the ranking task and rank infer from the pair comparison task show high agreement though with a few inversion
a x ie subject x rank order analysis of variance be perform on rank separately for each expression
the result indicate that the betweensubject variance be the dominant factor for all expression
the median proportion of variance account for be for the betweensubject factor compare with for the withinsubject factor
the betweensubject variance be significant for all word except uncommon
similar result be find for the pair comparison data interpret as show that betweensubject difference in the ranking of verbal uncertainty expression be not a artefact of withinsubject meaning of the anchor term always tossup and never be highly consistent across subject for each rank ior 
on the basis of their result budescu and wallsten argue that
the practical implication of the present result be quite clear probability phrase may lead to ordinal confusion in usual communication
furthermore it must be true that use of number rather than phrase will eliminate this particular problem
assessment
this study provide a strong assessment of the reliability of withinsubject variability by its use of a week gap between session though memory of preceding replication can not be rule out
like some of the other study review here however a large set of the expression employ be distinctly frequentistic rather than probabilistic eg always never often frequently seldom rarely usually and usually not
this may increase betweensubject variance in both rank constitute a homogeneous set
betweensubject variance will be far increase by the presence of the expression predictable unpredictable common and uncommon in the stimulus set
in terms of betweensubject variability the significance of ordinal confusion be overstate
rank inversion do not necessitate confusion because of synonymity and resolution level
for example two speaker may differentially rank probable and likely but when one report that x be probable it do not follow that there will be a communication failure
misunderstanding will occur only with major inversion such as between likely and unlikely or likely and definite
this be because of the level of resolution apply
there be evidence that the resolution of uncertainty express in natural language be quite low ie zimmer find that the mean number of expression between the extreme of the probability range be imply the use of on average a point point out by budescu and wallsten this level of resolution be highly plausible given repeated demonstration that human can not handle discriminate or reliably transmit information about more than approximately seven distinct category miller xxp 
kong barnett mosteller and youtz 
kong barnett mosteller and youtz investigate group variability the effect of response format and betweenstudy variability in the use of verbal uncertainty expression among medical personnel
specifically physician medical student and other medical personnel assign numerical value to expression use one or more of four response format table vary nonsystematically within expression almost certain probable and likely
estimate be make in the context of a unspecified symptomdisease combination
one of the senior physician in your hospital have tell you that a particular symptom be in the disease you be discuss
what would be your estimate of the frequency of this symptom in be to be fill by one of the twelve expression list in table 
subject respond use one of the four response format indicate in table 
the expression in order of mean with response format in parenthesis be show in table 
result show low variability between the three subject group identify by the author physician house officer medical student and other medical professional the mean range of group median among expression being 
data be therefore pool across subject group for subsequent analysis
result show that for probable and likely response format have no effect on mean assignment
for almost certain however the mean on the hp scale be high than the mean on the us scale and high than the mean on the fc scale though difference in median be not as great nor in the same direction
no significance test be report however and therefore no clear conclusion can be draw
whose mean be near the center of the distribution than the extreme and subadditivity be find to occur for the mean of the symmetric pair likely and unlikely
""
a crossstudy comparison on result for expression table employ at least twice over study kong et al kenney bryant and norman mapes and toogood show that the large mean difference between expression be and the average difference for expression with mean between and ie exclude the more extreme expression for which range be typically low be 
this be consider quite low given that such crossstudy comparison confound a number of factor whose effect would be to inflate apparent difference
assessment
the primary observation be that if response format do affect numerical assignment then since no consistent response format be employ comparison of result for different expression be unreliable as be betweenstudy comparison
a secondary observation be that like some of the study the domain of uncertainty
for example not unreasonable have value connotation and frequent almost never and never be plainly frequentistic
the majority of the expression employ in the crossstudy analysis fall into this latter category question the specificity of the result to uncertainty expression
wallsten fillenbaum and cox 
the most systematic study of the effect of context sensitivity on the meaning of verbal uncertainty term be carry out by wallsten fillenbaum and cox henceforth wallsten et al
a who investigate the effect of prior probability on the interpretation of verbal expression
context effect have be demonstrate for some type of adverbial quantifier
for example borges and sawyers find that the meaning of most lots many some several and few in the context of frequency of marble vary with the total number available pepper and prytulak find that seldom sometimes frequently very often vary as a function of the expected frequency of the event quantify eg shoot in hollywood western vs earthquake in california and mapes find that physician assessment of the meaning of rare in the context of side effect of betablocker be more extreme than similar assessment in the context of antihistamine
wallsten et al
b report two study since the result of the first study be extend in the second the former be not describe here
the second study be precede by a pilot study to determine perceived base rate for a number of scenario
for the pilot study scenario be devise each with level of a variable design to induce low intermediate or high judgement of prior
for example what be the probability of snowfall in montreal in septembernovembermarch three set of material be prepare each contain all scenario be give one of the set and instruct to assess the probability of each scenario be true
thirtysix scenario be select for which assignment in the high and low value scenario differ by a tscore of at least 
the mean estimated probability of the high level of scenario range from to and from to for the low level
the mean difference between level be 
the main study employ eighteen expression classify by the author as probability expression and frequency expression table 
each of the scenario obtain from the pilot study be combine with of these expression at each of its two level of base rate to produce distinct statement
for each scenario the selected expression be choose on the basis of plausibility rather than random assignment
as a example the statement for a scenario concerning air pollution be generate from the expression by base rate in the following frame
there be toolong to be high air pollution in louisvillepittsburg than indicate option set
the statement be split into set of each consist of scenario x base rate
each level of base rate appear with the same probability or frequency expression
each of the stimulus set be administer to one group of subject
the experiment can therefore be describe as a factorial intertwined design the three factor independent variable be scenario base rate highlow and expression 
for each statement subject be ask to provide direct estimate of the probability that a hypothetical expert might have mean by the particular probability or frequency expression and far to indicate the upper and low bound of the range that might have be intend
these be treat as three separate dependent variable though since similar effect be find for all three upper and low limit be omit from the following discussion
subject assignment be find to be sensitive to expression and also to base rate within virtually every scenario
the mean variable be with a standard deviation of 
this compare with a mean difference of for the unquantified statement in the pilot study
the base rate effect itself be find to vary systematically across expression
mean assignment in the main task be plot as a function of base rate for each of the expression use point constitute by scenario x level of the variable
these be then fit with linear structural equation isaacs which simultaneously minimize the sum of square deviation over both axis
for each linear structural equation a slope of would indicate that interpretation of a prediction be determine completely by base rate or that subject be judge base rate a slope of would indicate that base rate have no effect on interpretation and a slope between and would indicate that both base rate and the quantifying expression have a effect on the interpretation of the prediction or alternatively that some subject judge base rate and some the independent data be consider
for the expression sure likely probable good chance possible and poor chance and for a similar number of the frequency expression not discuss here slope be low positive and significantly different from both and 
for these expression interpretation of the meaning of a expression in a statement appear to be a combination of the base rate of the event describe and the independent meaning of the quantifying expression
thus when a expression be apply to a event with a high base rate relative to the independent meaning of that expression the resulting prediction will be judge to have a probability low than that base rate
when the situation be reverse the expression will be judge to have a probability high than the base rate
the critical level or context independent meaning be the value at the intercept between the linear structural equation and the identity line in the sense that
as a example the linear structural equation for the expression likely cross the identity line approximately at the coordinate 
for scenario with a base rate great than obtain in the pilot study the effect of quantification by likely be to reduce the perceived probability of that event
for scenario with a base rate less than quantification by likely will increase the perceived probability of the event
in other word the interpretation of these expression as measure by their assigned probability be between the context independent value for likely and the perceived base rate of the event be quantify or as wallsten et al
assert it be as if the subject interpretation of the expert prediction represent some kind of a average between the prior probability of the event and the meaning of the probabilistic modifier xxp 
the difference between high and low uncertainty expression be attribute to their relative weight in the averaging process than be neutral or high probability expression xxp 
if this be true base rate would be expect to have little effect for low expression such as unlikely and would explain why slope for these expression be generally low
assessment
there be a number of corollary and caveat to the interpretation of the result outline
firstly the explanation of the difference between the low and nonlow expression imply that the interpretation of low probability expression be not affect by base rate
this be true for the expression unlikely whose slope be significantly different from but not 
however for the expression improbable and doubtful slope be neither significantly different from nor imply that interpretation of the statement be relate neither to base rate nor to contextindependent meaning of the quantifying expression
secondly evidence for the proposed base rate shift be base on the assumption that the numerical assignment make by subject be themselves not affect by base be affect by the perceived base rate of the event be describe then it be arguable that numerical expression such as would be affect in the same way
in other word if the meaning of the expression likely be affect by the prior of the event it describe then why be this not the case for expression such as could it be that really mean gt when apply to a proposition with a high prior and lt when apply to a proposition with a low prior there be nothing specific to numerical expression that predispose them to be veridical
if both verbal uncertainty expression and numerical uncertainty expression be see as way of summarize reason for believe and reason for disbelieve a proposition then it be arguable that they will be affect by the same kind of phenomenon
thirdly the overall mean difference between base rate level across expression be find to be in the pilot study but in the main study
wallsten et al
attribute this difference to it be clear that since the base rate pair be select on a nonrandom basis ie only those with tscore difference gt this difference must reflect some regression towards the mean though how much it be not possible to gauge
ideally once the set of stimulus have be select a far group of subject would have judge the probability of each event and these value would be use as base rate in the main study
fourthly as suggest above rather than support a averaging hypothesis as wallsten et al
suggest it be clear that the postulated averaging process for the group data might simply be due to subgroup of subject each assess either the independent meaning of the expression or the prior of the event they quantify
wallsten budescu rapoport zwick and forsyth 
although a considerable theoretical literature exist on fuzzy set theory empirical work be relatively sparse
the term that have be investigate empirically include large small short cold warm obsolete up to date and old young review by wallsten et al
b xxp 
in some case investigator have also assess the effect of quantification by modifier such as not very not very sort of and so on on the resulting membership function
wallsten budescu rapoport zwick and forsyth henceforth wallsten et al employ two variant of a graded pair comparison procedure to determine fuzzy membership function for a number of verbal uncertainty expression
in the first variant two radially divided spinner with segment of opposing color denote different probability be present on a computer monitor
on each trial one of ten uncertainty expression table be print above the spinner
subject task be to indicate which spinner probability be best represent by the expression by move a of displacement represent the relative appropriateness of the two spinner
probability on the two spinner be vary factorially for each expression and subject within a previously elicit individual range intend to represent the maximum and minimum probability point of applicability for each expression
response arrow position be analyze use conjointmeasurement theory and value obtain for each term according to various scaling model
these value be normalize to be nonnegative with a arbitrary maximum of and plot against probability value to produce membership function
in a second variant of the task conduct to validate result of the first two uncertainty expression be present with one spinner on each trial
the task be to indicate via arrow position which of the expression be better represent by the spinner probability and by how much
the entire procedure be repeat on each of three occasion of approximately two day separation employ graduate student as subject
the data analyze be for the second and third session
stimulus expression appear in table 
expression be judge by all subject doubtful tossup likely improbable good chance and possible while the others be judge by half the subject
during trial a index card be constantly in view list all the expression the subject would encounter during the course of the experiment
analysis of the range of upper and low value show considerable variability between subject
the low variability be obtain for the expression almost certain almost impossible and tossup
for the expression possible the st and rd quartile of the estimated upper limit be approximately and respectively value infer from graph indicate major disagreement in the semantics of this expression as operationalize in the study
thirtythree percent of the membership function obtain be multipeaked
the remaining be either point flat monotonic or single peaked 
there be no expression shape
expression nearer the extreme of the probability scale tend to be monotonic rather than single peak
fuzzy membership function be generally not characterize as have multipeaked distribution
such distribution imply either ambiguity in the meaning of a expression measurement error or inappropriateness of the variable over which the function be measure
wallsten et al
attribute the multiple peaked nature of some of these function to measurement error and it be arguable that the number of multipeaked distribution would decrease if the sample size of response from which membership function be derive be to increase
interpretation of the result of this study be confound by sample probability over range specify by subject
such estimate may be conservative prevent assessment of complete membership function for each subject and make betweensubject comparison difficult
a second study be carry out to rectify this deficiency
study ii
in the second study the eight most accurate subject complete task similar to those describe early use probability sample over identical and broad range with a reduced stimulus set the unlikely and possible be omit
for this second study of the function be find to be monotonic and single peak the extreme expression tend to have monotonic function and the more central one single peak
in general membership function for any individual be stable over session but differ considerably from subject to subject for all expression except tossup and doubtful
tossup yield single peak function for all subject doubtful yield monotonic decreasing function for the subject who judge it
for the remaining phrase there be a mixture of single peaked and monotonic function
far sameshaped function be not across identical range
for example peak in singlepeaked function be not coincident
comparison of result between the two experiment show that of the membership function obtain in study be the same shape as their corresponding function in study indicate not unreasonable withinsubject variability across the two experiment
wallsten et al
interpret these result as derive membership function for verbal uncertainty expression
assessment
although monotonic and single peaked function be clearly consistent with the semantics propose by fuzzy set theory the theoretic model employ by zimmer bonissone and others be trapezoidal
this mean that function derive from technique such as the robbinsmonroe procedure zimmer or implementation such as that of bonissone et al
 be at best approximation to the true underlying function though it be difficult to gauge the extent and therefore significance of the departure
what be clear however be that many data point may be require to produce reliable membership function for some individual
rapoport wallsten and cox 
the study describe early have employ a variety of direct and indirect scaling procedure for investigate the use of verbal uncertainty expression but with little discussion of the particular characteristic of the procedure employ
the psychophysical and psychological literature have provide numerous demonstration however that the technique employ to investigate a particular behavior or mental of verbal uncertainty expression then as in other scientific task a theory of the measuring instrument or procedure be essential to a understanding of the observed phenomenon
rapoport et al
provided the first comprehensive evaluation of two distinct procedure for scale verbal uncertainty expression in a comparison of the membership function derive from a direct estimation task de and a graded pair comparison task pc
these two procedure differ in so far as the pc procedure be a priori more reliable since it require comparative rather than absolute judgment and it be possible to check for internal consistency in a set of judgment but be more time consume
in turn ordinal scaling task be consider more reliable than both de and pc task since they require only ordinal level of judgment
the pragmatic rationale for such a comparison be that cross validation of the two procedure equivalent membership function would suggest that the less laborious de procedure might be substitute for the pair comparison procedure in the investigation of verbal uncertainty expression
less data
in this study four group of five subject each scale five of thirteen expression table in three task across three session for practice and for data collection separate by day
the expression be divide into three group correspond to high probability first two row in table neutral middle row and low probability bottom two row
each expression be associate with a set of probability value determine from the range in wallsten et al
b study ii
these cover a range of of the unit interval at interval of 
for low expression the value be for the neutral expression they be and for the high expression 
""
""
""
these value be represent as yellow sector on spinner
the membership function derive be thus highly discrete
the de task consist of a number of trial in which a expression of the associated probability
the task be to indicate use a joystick how well the expression describe the probability indicate on the spinner
a total of repetition x expression x probability be use to generate membership function for each expression and subject
the pc task employ the same graded pair comparison procedure as wallsten et al
b above
a third ordinal scaling task rank ordering ro be also administer in which a expression be print at the top of the screen above six spinner represent the associated probability value
the task be to rank the spinner according to how well each be describe by the expression
inclusion of this task permit comparison of result for the de and pc task with this more reliable task the relative validity of the de and pc procedure be assess by the degree to which the membership function generate accord with the ordinal data from this ro task
as in wallsten et al
b membership function be derive from data for the de have maximum of 
analysis across session show the three procedure to be equally consistent with membership function be roughly constant for each person but differ between individual
as a result of the latter rapoport et al
argue that the result would be troublesome for designer of expert system who wish to incorporate membership function represent the meaning of particular term
""
analysis of the membership function show that allow for single inversion whose magnitude do not exceed zz of all function of the function derive from the de and pc procedure be monotonic or single peaked though for the expression possible of the function be neither weakly monotonic nor single peaked
these result be comparable with those of wallsten et al
b
comparison of the de and pc function show that for virtually every expression and subject the two procedure yield the same shape function
however with the exception of the expression possible the function yield by those elicit by the pc procedure xxv suggest that the de function be more fuzzy
ordinal property of the pcderived function be closer to those from the ro procedure than be the dederived function endorse the a priori expectation that the pc procedure be more reliable than the de procedure
on practical ground however it be argue that since the resulting function be not so different the de method may yield function that be sufficiently accurate for some low resolution purpose
the function generate in this study be also use to test the applicability of various operator suggest by zadeh for model the effect of quantification on the meaning of a expression for the modifier very and rather
zadeh s claim be that if the meaning of a expression x can be model by a fuzzy membership function over some variable then the meaning of a expression such as very x be simply a membership function over the same variable determine by
the operator investigate be concentration and intensification
concentration have the effect of create a membership function for the modified expression that be less than that for the unmodified expression in part of the distribution where the latter be less than 
intensification have the effect of increasing value in the membership function that be great than and decrease those that be below 
the effect of the modifier rather be find to be unsystematic and not describe by either of zadeh s proposed model suggest that the modifier rather should be eschew in the development of system for specific applied purpose xxp 
effect of modification by very also vary between subject but zadeh s concentration model work well for of the out of case for which the unmodified membership function be monotonic
assessment
the existence of individual difference between the derived membership function be beyond dispute
the conclusion of rapoport et al
concerning expert system design be misleading however since too large to render them unusable
as in the early discussion of other study it be useful to think in terms of the amount of miscomprehension encounter between two speaker whose function differ
a more general question be whether the individual variability reflect the appropriateness of the fuzzy set model for verbal uncertainty expression
for the expression possible doubt be raise
critical discussion
in the introduction a number of question relate to withinsubject variability betweensubject variability and context dependency be raise in connection with the use of verbal uncertainty expression
these be discuss in the following section
withinsubject variability
withinsubject variability be generally find to be low johnson bryant and norman beythmarom budescu and wallsten rapoport et al
 though only the study of budescu and wallsten make a serious attempt to control for simple replication of performance effect
the time between replication be too small in other study
betweensubject variability
there be conflicting conclusion with respect to betweensubject variability
a bryant and norman budescu and wallsten or specifically point to large individual difference wallsten et al
b rapoport et al
 while others interpret their result as show encouragingly low variability lichtenstein and newman kong et al
""
the basis for this apparent disagreement appear to be the variety of scale procedure employ and implicit notion of resolution
the study that have report range variance statistics have do so with little or no theoretical rationale and have not attempt to quantitatively draw out the implication of their finding
whereas a standard deviation of in numerical assignment would constitute low variability in some circumstance it might be consider high in others
a consensus measure of betweensubject variability would be beneficial though it be also clear that such a measure must embody some notion of the granularity of information in the task for which it be to be use
the same apply to the interpretation of the significance of rank inversion
generally communication failure will occur only with unlikely or likely and definite but not because of ordinal variability between similar term such as probable and likely
indeed empirical estimate of the resolution level of uncertainty expression appear to be approximately about the number of different category that can be reliably process miller 
two factor that confound the analysis of betweensubject variability be stimulus set composition and the nature of the scaling task themselves
stimulus set composition
many study employ a large number of distinctly nonprobabilistic or not uncertainty base expression
these include frequentistic expression usually seldom and slightly moreless than half the time lichtenstein and newman always sometimes and never bryant and norman always never often frequently seldom rarely usually and usually not budescu and wallsten never kong et al
 expression embody utility consideration best bet bryant and norman comparative expression most likely beythmarom logical expression be consistent with be compatible with effectively exclude can not be exclude bryant and norman expression involve expectation fair chance good chance lichtenstein and newman expect bryant and norman meaningful chance beythmarom expression of prototypicality pathognomonic classic and normally bryant and norman and a host of other expression that be difficult to classify as unequivocally probabilistic rather and inconclusive lichtenstein and newman hopefully bryant and norman one must consider one can nt rule it out entirely not inevitable perhaps one should assume and reasonable to assume beythmarom not unreasonable bryant and norman kong et al
 predictable unpredictable common and uncommon budescu and wallsten necessary feasible conceivable and possible reyna 
the inclusion of these expression both undermine the specificity of result to the domain of uncertainty expression and inflate the apparent value of rangevariability statistics by require subject to scale what be heterogeneous strictly noncomparable stimulus on the same unidimensional scale
scale task
the problem with the scaling task be twofold
firstly direct scaling task be of low ecological validity
in general when reason about uncertainty people do not translate verbal expression into numerical estimate even if the precision of the available information be high
verbal estimate like numerical value be essentially way of summarize the available information into a particularly good at translate one frequently used way of summarize uncertainty into another seldomly employ representation the fact that people rarely communicate uncertainty numerically question the use of numerical assignment task for assess verbal representation of uncertainty
secondly and more significantly assess the property of verbal uncertainty expression such as betweensubject variability context effect can not be achieve by the direct assignment of numerical value since these have their own scaling property which confound the analysis
adequate assessment can only be achieve by the use of independent measure of probability such as the spinner task employ by wallsten and colleague where there be a independent scale against which assessment can be compare
in sum there appear to be little justification for assess the variability of verbal uncertainty expression by the use of direct assessment of numerical value
context dependency
the study of johnson find no difference in task context and the study of beythmarom produce result that be difficult to interpret for reason discuss early
the study of estimate assign to verbal uncertainty expression may be influence by the perceived base rate of the event be describe although the alternate interpretation be that the apparent conditioning on base rate be a artefact of average the result of different processing strategy rather than represent variation within sample of homogeneous processing strategy
if verify however their suggestion would have a number of implication for the use and interpretation of verbal uncertainty expression in al though demonstration be await
firstly it would follow that interpretation of verbal uncertainty term will be expect to be influence by factor that affect perception of base rate including availability and other cognitive bias
secondly information concerning perceived base rate or prior would need to be incorporate into a interface that seek to communicate degree of uncertainty to a user
thirdly it suggest the intriguing possibility that such expression may serve partially to act as indicator of change in confidence rather than of confidence level per se
such a notion be embody in the certainty factor formalism develop in the expert system assumption of unidimensionality that the expression employ can be characterize as point region or fuzzy subset on a unidimensional scale pervade all the study report but be explicitly address in only one reyna 
this study provided data that be not incommensurate with a unidimensional view of uncertainty but have a number of methodological flaw describe early
thus the question of dimensionality be empirically open
what be clear however be that many of the expression employ in the study describe do not fit neatly into a unidimensional mould see discussion of betweensubject variability for example
it have also be argue that the pervasiveness of the unidimensional assumption have have the effect of obscure the rich semantics that underlie many verbal uncertainty expression eg fox a b teigen 
conclusion
overall there be little evidence to suggest that verbal uncertainty expression be inappropriate for communicating uncertainty in expert system and other decision technology
equally however their appropriateness await validation distribution
one method of determine whether the distribution of estimate for the beythmarom data be approximately normal be to check whether the estimate of standard deviation inferrable from her figure for the iqr and range be approximately equal
from ztables the iqr occupy that part of the distribution between and standard deviation and the range occur between and standard deviation
beythmarom s mean figure for these range be and respectively
these lead to standard deviation estimate of and respectively
thus we have evidence to suggest that the population of response be approximately normally distribute
the general formula for the variance of difference between sample from population with equal mean and variance ferguson be
multiple line equation can not be represent in ascii text 
where sigma be the variance of the population be sample
when n n it follow that the standard error of the difference between sample be approximately standard deviation
be thus the iqr give a reasonable indication of the average pairwise difference between any pair of score whereas the range do not
this paper give a account of some of the major aspect of buddhist psychology
the survey be confine to the text of early or theravada buddhism that is the canonical text and their early pali commentary and related expository text
the importance of psychological concept in the philosophy and practice of buddhism be highlight
the problem inherent in the study of buddhist psychology be discuss including the problem of translation and interpretation
the paper then describe and analyze several key early buddhist psychological notion including basic drive that motivate behavior perception and cognition consciousness personal development and enlightenment meditation and behavior change
the relationship between theory and practice in buddhist psychology be comment on with special reference to meditative technique and other behavior change strategy
finally comment be make on the possible interaction between buddhist and modern psychology
introduction
this paper aim to provide a descriptive and analytical account of buddhist psychology
it do not attempt a comprehensive review of the subject the literature literature be too vast to permit a comprehensive review in a single paper
what be present here be essentially a selective account of the psychological notion find in buddhism
only some of the major concept be discuss
some practical aspect of buddhist psychology that have a relevance to therapeutic practice be also review
the paper be selective in another important way
it be confine to theravada buddhism also refer to as early buddhism and do not deal with later development including zen
for a account of theravada buddhism see gombrich for a discussion of the different school of buddhism see kalupahana snelling and thomas 
the literature
the literature of early buddhism be in the pali language
it consist of the original buddhist canon which be put together soon after the buddha s death and commit to write in the first century bc the early pali commentary on the canon that be in their present form by the end of the same period which be best describe as expository and interpretive works
the canon consist of three part sutta pitaka which contain the discourse of the buddha on various occasion throughout his preaching life vinaya pitaka which contain the rule of discipline for the monk and abhidhama pitaka which contain highly systematize philosophical and psychological analysis which be finalize in their present form about bc later than the material in the other two part
a full account of the pall canon be give in webb 
the individual book of the canon be list in table 
the early pall commentary include major text such as sumangalavilasini manorathapurani papancasudani and dhammapadatthakatha which be commentary on specific part of the canon
the early expository and interpretive text include among others visuddhimagga milindapanha and nettippakarana
problem of translation
the entire canon and the majority of the commentary and expository works have be translate into english and publish by the pali text society 
however the english version be often beset with problem of translation and interpretation
perhaps it be worth illustrate this problem with example
a major example be the term dukkha sanskrit duhkha translate by many as suffering
this have lead to buddhism be describe as essentially a pessimistic religion as suffering be state as characterize all existence
some author have offer alternative translation such as unsatisfactoriness disharmony and painfulness gunaratna matthews 
none of these offer a precise rendering of the original term and rahula among others leave the term untranslated
another example be the very challenging term papanca sanskrit prapanca derive from pra panc to spread out
in his book the principle of buddhist psychology david kalupahana consistently translate this as obsession
this be clearly misleading although the official palienglish dictionary of the pali text society rhys as one rendering of this word
this be a key term in buddhist psychology and have be variously translate as impediment conceptual proliferation manifoldness diffusion complex and imagination among others
this will be return to in a later paragraph
it should be clear from these example that the problem of translation be a major obstacle to one s understanding of early buddhism or indeed any other ancient system of thought
for this reason the material in this paper be draw from the original pall text
the buddha and buddhism
before focus on buddhist psychology it be necessary to make a few introductory comment on buddha and buddhism
the buddha the word derive from the root budh to know to comprehend literally mean the enlightened one live in the foothills of the himalayan range of mountain in northern india from to bc for excellent account of the and schumann useful account be also available in carrithers and saddhatissa 
the main teaching of the buddha be contain in the four noble truth
see rahula and saddhatissa for a full discussion of the main tenet of buddhism
these be i that life be characterize by suffer and be unsatisfactory dukkha ii that the cause samudaya of the suffering be crave or desire tanha iii that this suffering can be end nirodha via the cessation of crave or desire this be the state of nibbana and iv that there be a way magga to achieve this cessation which be call the noble eightfold path eg samyutta nikaya xxv 
the noble eightfold path be also call the middle path as it avoid the extreme of a sensuous and luxurious life on the one hand
the eight aspect of the path be right understanding right think right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
the person who undertake a life base on this path renounce worldly attachment hope eventually to attain the arahant state which may be describe as a state of perfection the word arahant literally mean the worthy one
this state mark the attainment of nibbana
the other teaching of the buddha include the negation of a permanent and unchanging soul anatta and the notion of the impermanence or transience of thing anicca eg majjhima nikaya 
buddhism also exclude the notion of a god there be no creator or a supreme be who rule purvey and control the universe
thus there be no absolutism in buddhism either in the form of a external god or a unchanging universe or a unchanging soul
for the laity the vast majority of to the immediate quest for nibbana the buddha provide a sound and pragmatic social ethic
they be expect to lead a life characterize by restraint and moderation respecting the right of others and be dutiful to those around them
such a restrained and dutiful life be consider not only to be a necessary prerequisite for one s ultimate religious aim it be also value as a end in itself
for example the buddha advise his lay follower to abstain from alcoholic beverage because alcohol indulgence could lead to demonstrable illeffect such as loss of wealth proneness to socially embarrassing behavior unnecessary quarrel disrepute illhealth and eventual mental derangement sigalovada sutta digha nikaya iii 
this empirical and pragmatic approach be a prominent feature of the ethical stance of buddhism
for a discussion of buddhist ethics see saddhatissa and tachibana 
the psychology of buddhism theory
the considerable interest show by modern student in buddhist psychology become entirely understandable when it be realize that
some part of the canonical text as well as later writing be example of explicit psychological theorizing while many of the others present psychological assumption and much material of psychological relevance
for example the abhidhamma pitaka contain a highly systematize psychological account of human behavior and mind and the translation of one of the abhidhamma book the dhammasangani be give the title a buddhist manual of psychological ethics by its translator caroline rhys davids when it be first publish in 
the practice of buddhism as a religion and a way of life involve much in terms of psychological change
the ultimate religious goal of the arahant state both reflect upon and require major psychological change
the path towards the achievement of this goal the noble eightfold path involve step which can only be describe as psychological eg right think right understanding
as the goal be attainable essentially through one s own effort it be not surprising that buddhism have much to say about one s thinking god one can turn to for one s salvation
nor do the buddha claim to be able to ensure any of his follower the attainment of the goal
on the contrary the buddha explicitly state that he be only a teacher who could show the way and that the actual task of achieve the goal be up to each individual s effort
as a muchquoted passage in the dhammapada which be part of the khuddaka nikaya say the task have to be accomplish by yourself
the enlightened one only teach the way
some basic notion
in the following section some of the main psychological aspect of buddhism will be discuss
motivation
perhaps the most logical starting point be the theory of motivation
what drive people in their behavior what motivate human action the unenlightened person s behavior it be say be govern and drive by tanha or crave which as note in a previous paragraph be give as the cause of suffering or classify into three basic form kama tanha crave for sensory gratification bhava tanha crave for survival or continued existence and vibhava tanha crave for annihilation eg samyutta nikaya xxv 
it be interesting that these three primary drive in buddhism have be compare by some author to the freudian notion of libido ego and thanatos respectively de silva 
like freudian theory this theory of motivation may be see as a primarily reductionist one all action have as their source a small number of drive
while crave be see as the source of suffering the term tanha be not exclusively use in a negative sense
there be several instance in the literature where it be acknowledge that one can also develop a tanha for the cessation of suffering
thus tanha can take the form of or can be turn into a desirable force
for example the expository text nettippakarana say here
while the unwholesome kind go with the unsatisfactory worldly existence the wholesome kind lead to the abandonment of crave
""
in a far analysis of motivation buddhism identify three factor that lead to unwholesome or undesirable behavior
these be raga passion or lust dosa hatred or malice and moha delusion or false belief eg anguttara nikaya i ii 
all unwholesome action be see as derive from a set of fundamental root
in fact the text explicitly refer to these as root mula
they be call akusalamulas for example unwholesome or unprofitable root
it be not make explicit whether these always operate at a conscious level
on the other hand certain clearly nonconscious factor also have a part to play in determining behavior
one such group of factor mention be anusaya translate as latent tendency latent bias predisposition and latent disposition
always in bad sense rhys davids and stede xxp 
the term itself from anu si to lie down lie dormant indicate that these be nonconscious factor
these dispositional factor be part and parcel of one s personality acquire through past experience and they play their part in influence one s behavior and contribute to the perpetuation of the cycle of suffering
seven type of anusaya be often mention
the list give in samyutta nikaya xxv be as follow tendency to want pleasure tendency to anger or disgust tendency to speculation tendency to doubt tendency to conceit tendency to want continuous existence or growth and tendency to ignorance
another group of factor which be nonconscious and which influence one s behavior be the asavas sanskrit asrava from the root sru to flow or ooze
this term have be variously translate as influx and canker
these be factor high
it be say that they intoxicate and bemuddle the mind rhys davids and stede xxp 
they color one attitude and thwart one s insight
in one s endeavor for selfdevelopment one have to excise them and this be do through wisdom
the influx be describe as arise from different factor sensuality aggression cruelty body and individuality be give in one account digha nikaya iii 
other list include among others gain loss fame disrepute and evil intention anguttara nikaya iv
motive for good or wholesome action be usually express in negative term
the most consistent account be the one which give araga nonpassion or absence of passion adosa nonhatred or absence of hatred and amoha nondelusion or absence of delusion as the root of good action the opposite of the root of unwholesome behavior anguttara nikaya i term as caga renunciation metta loving kindness and panna wisdom understand anguttara nikaya iii
it be state that one must strive to develop these in order to combat their opposite
perception and cognition
perception be base on twelve gateway or modality ayatana six of these be the five sense organ plus the mind or inner sense and the other six be the object of each of these samyutta nikaya ii 
the status of mind mano be special
it have the ability to reflect on the object of the other sense so in this way it be link to the activity of all the sense kalupahana 
each combination of sense organ and its object lead to a particular consciousness vinnana for example visual consciousness arise because of the eye and material shape
when consciousness be add to each of the pair of modality one get eighteen factor of cognition be present in table 
it be say
the meeting of the three ie eye material shape and visual consciousness be contact because of this contact arise feeling what one feel one perceive
majjhima nikaya 
this be a fairly straightforward account of how perception take place
however the buddhist exposition go beyond this
the account continue
what one perceive one reason about
what one reason about one turn into papanca
what one turn into papanca because of that factor assail him in regard to material shape recognizable by the eye belong to the past the future and the present
""
""
majjhima nikaya 
it will be recall that the term papanca be cite in a early paragraph as a example of a word pose particular difficulty for the translator
in this passage the verbal form papanceti be use
thus the final stage of the process of the term in various context relate to cognition show that it refer to the gross conceptual aspect of the process as it be consequent to vitakka reasoning
once a object be perceive there be initial application of thought to it follow by papanca which in this context be best take to mean a tendency to proliferation of idea
as a result the person be no long the perceiver who be in control but one who be assail by concept generate by this prolific tendency
he be overwhelm by concept and linguistic convention
one s perception be in this way open to distortion and elaboration due to the spontaneous proliferation of thought
this proliferation be say to be link to tanha crave mana conceit and dittthi dogma or rigidly hold view maha niddesa i 
they be all bind up with the notion of i and mine
this mark the intrusion of the ego into the field of sense atta sanskrit atman but the delusion of self affect all one s behavior sutta nipata 
one of the aim of personal development be to enable oneself to see reality as it be without the essential distortion arise from the various factor that characterize the unenlightened person be function
a major aspect of reach the state of arahant be indeed the freeing of one s perception from these distort influence
when one reach a state of perfection one s perception become free of such distortion and allow a direct appraisal of the object
the arahant state
it be perhaps the appropriate place now to consider the arahant state and its attainment
the religious goal of a buddhist be to attain this state which mark the end of the cycle of suffering
this require a process of personal development involve disciplined living sila serious meditative effort mark by concentration samadhi and wisdom panna which be attain through such effort
but what there be numerous description of a arahant in the text
for example
the arahant have destroy the canker live the life do what be need to be do set down the burden achieve wellbeing shattered life s fetter and be free by perfect knowledge
he have apply himself to six thing to dispassion to detachment to harmlessness to the destruction of crave to the destruction of rasping and to nondelusion
anguttara nikaya iii
in psychological term the arahant s action no long emanate from the common basic motive of passion hatred and delusion
he be however capable of joy or positive sentiment
he have loving kindness metta to all and compassion karuna
he indulge in nothing and be restrain in his behavior
nine standard of behavior be list which a arahant can not and do not transgress take life steal sexual contact utter falsehood enjoy the comfort of wealth delusion and through fear anguttara nikaya iv
they contribute to society by be teacher and adviser and be no burden on their fellow being
practical aspect of buddhist psychology personal development and meditation
it be note above that the attainment of the arahant state require personal development base on both restrain and disciplined conduct and meditative effort
this explain why meditation be give a central place in buddhist text
in addition to numerous canonical discussion large section of buddhaghosa s visuddhimagga be devoted to a consideration of this subject in great detail
it be significant that the pall word for meditation bhavana etymologically mean development or cultivation
""
as there be a large and still growing amount of literature on this subject in english only a few brief comment will be make here
detailed discussion be available in pradhan soleleris and vajiranana see also claxton and kwee 
two form of meditation be and the other vipassana insight
while far form of meditation have be develop in later form of buddhism and these include various tibetan and zen technique these two represent the early buddhist technique date back year
it be worth note that meditation of the samatha type be also find in some other ancient indian system while vipassana be a uniquely buddhist development nanamoli rahula 
the word samatha mean tranquility or serenity
samatha meditation be aim at reach state of consciousness characterize by progressively great level of tranquility and stillness
it have two aspect a the achievement of the high possible degree of concentration and b the progressive calming of all mental process
this be do through increasingly concentrate focus of attention the mind withdraw progressively from all external and internal stimulus
in the end state of pure and undistracted consciousness can be achieve
the samatha meditation procedure start with effort at concentrate the mind of state of what be call jhana or mental absorption visuddhimagga 
vipassana or insight meditation also start with concentration exercise use appropriate object on which one focus
in this procedure however once a certain level of concentration be achieve so that undistracted focusing can be maintain one go on to examine with steady careful attention and in great detail all sensory and mental process
through this contemplation one become a detached observer of one s own activity
the object of this contemplation be classify as fourfold body sensation mental state and mental object for example various moral and intellectual subject
the aim be to achieve total and immediate awareness or mindfulness of all phenomenon
this lead it be claim eventually to the full and clear perception of the impermanence of all thing and being majjhima nikaya i samyutta nikaya xxv 
it be hold that samatha meditation by itself can need to attain this goal
while the former lead to temporarily altered state of consciousness it be the latter which lead to endure and thoroughgoing change in the person and pave the way to achieve the arahant state
benefit of meditation
the practical implication of the claim make in buddhism for meditation be quite clear
the meditative experience of both type when properly carry out and develop be claim to lead to great ability to concentrate great freedom from distraction great tolerance of change and turmoil around oneself and sharp awareness and great alertness about one s own response both physical and mental
they would also lead more generally to great calmness or tranquility
while the ultimate goal of perfection will require a long series of regular training period of systematic meditation couple with major restraint in one s conduct the more mundane benefit of meditation should be available to all serious and persist practitioner
from a applied perspective buddhist meditation technique may be see as a instrument for achieve certain psychological a stressreduction strategy comparable to the more modern technique of relaxation
there be a substantial literature in present day clinical psychology and psychiatry which show that meditation can produce beneficial effect in this way carrington kwee shapiro west 
study of the physiological change that accompany meditation have show several change to occur which together indicate a state of calmness or relaxation woolfolk 
these include reduction in oxygen consumption lowered heart rate decrease breathe rate and blood pressure reduction in serum lactic acid level and increased skin resistance and change in blood flow
these peripheral change be generally compatible with decreased arousal in the sympathetic nervous system
there be also certain central change as show by brain wave pattern
the amalgam of these physiological change relate to meditation have be call the relaxation response by some author benson 
interestingly the buddha himself advocate meditation for what we would today meditation be use to achieve trouble free sleep and as a way of control pain vinaya pitaka samyutta nikaya xxv 
it be perhaps worth dwelling briefly on the use of mindfulness meditation for pain control
a study publish in by kabatzinn lipworth and burney report that ninety chronic pain patient who be train in mindfulness meditation in a tenweek stressreduction program show significant improvement as measure by various index in pain and related symptom
a control group of patient who do not receive meditation training do not show such improvement
the rationale for select this strategy for the treatment of pain be explain as follow
in the case of pain perception the cultivation of detached observation of the pain experience may be achieve by pay careful attention and distinguish as separate event the actual primary sensation as they occur from momenttomoment and any accompanying thought about pain
kabatzinn et al xxp 
in another paper kabatzinn rationale for use mindfulness meditation for pain control
he show how mindfulness meditation can enable one to focus on sensation as they arise rather than attempt to escape from them
it help one to recognize the bare physical sensation unembellished by psychological elaboration
one learn to observe these psychological aspect as separate event
this uncoupling have the effect of change one s overall experience of pain
to quote the nociceptive signal sensory may be undiminished but the emotional and cognitive component of the pain experience the hurt the suffering be reduce kabatzinn xxp 
it be this detached observation of sensation that mindfulness meditation as describe in the buddhist text help one to develop
this make such meditation a particularly wellsuited strategy for pain control
in fact the reference in the text to pain control by mindfulness meditation appear to make this very point
for example it be state that the venerable ananda the buddha s personal assistant
on hear from the patient that he be in much pain and that his pain be get bad ananda advise him to engage in the meditation of mindfulness
a similar episode be record with reference to another householder manadinna ananda once again offer the same advice
similarly it be record that the buddha himself visit two ailing monk mogallana and kassapa who be in pain and advise each of them to engage in mindfulness meditation
perhaps the most impressive and most explicit in terms of the rationale for this use of meditation be the account give of the venerable anuruddha
he be sick and be grievously afflict
many monk who visit him find him calm and relax ask him how his painful sensation evidently make no impact on his mind
he reply it be because i have my mind wellgrounded in mindfulness
this be why the painful sensation that come upon me make no impression on my mind
the implication here be that meditation aspect of the pain for example while the physical sensation may remain intact one s vulnerability to subjectively feel pain be reduce
the above account be all from the samyutta nikaya which state this position quite explicitly in a different passage
the untrained layman when touch by painful bodily feeling grieve and lament and be distraught but the welltrained disciple when touch by painful bodily feeling will not weep nor grieve nor lament
""
""
nor will he be distraught
""
""
the layman when touch by painful bodily feeling weep he experience two kind of feeling a bodily one and a mental one
it be as if a man be hit by one arrow and then by a second arrow he feel the pain of two arrow
so it be with the untrained layman when touch by a painful bodily feeling he experience two kind of feeling a bodily one and mental one
but the welltrained disciple not
""
""
he feel only one kind of feeling a bodily one not a mental one
it be as if a man be hit by one arrow but not by a second arrow he feel the pain of one arrow only
so it be with the welltrained disciple when touch by a painful bodily feeling he feel but one feeling bodily pain only
samyutta nikaya iv 
the view of pain contain in this expository account be quite clear physical pain sensation be usually accompany by psychological correlate which be like a second pain
the disciple who be train in mindfulness meditation however see the physical sensation as it be and do not allow himself to be affect by the psychological elaboration of pain
thus his experience be limit to the perception of the physical sensation only
it be this account of pain that provide the rationale for the instance cite above where those in pain be advise to engage in mindfulness buddhism also contain a wide range of behavior change strategy other than meditation used and recommend by the buddha and his disciple which can only be describe as behavioral
this aspect of buddhism have be neglect by modern researcher until very recently
it be only in the last few year that these behavioral strategy have be highlight and discuss de silva 
these strategy be remarkably similar to several of the established technique of modern behavior therapy
thus if buddhist psychology be akin to modern humanistic transpersonal and existential psychology in view of its emphasis on the individual his problem and anxiety his predicament and his development through personal effort it also have a clear affinity to presentday behavioral psychology in view of these behavioral technique
the way in which the overall approach of behavior modification and that of buddhism may be see as broadly similar have be discuss by william mikulas 
some area of similarity highlight by mikulas be the rejection of the notion of a unchanging on testability stress on technique for awareness of certain bodily response emphasize the here and now and dissemination of teaching and technique widely and publicly
give this broad similarity and the general toolong attitude of buddhism as exemplify by the kalama sutta anguttara nikaya i in which the buddha advise a group of inquirer not to accept anything on hearsay authority or pure argument but to accept only what be empirically and experientially verifiable it be not surprising that specific behavior change technique be use and recommend in early buddhism
it be also entirely consistent with the social ethic of buddhism which recognize the importance of behavior conducive to one s own and others wellbeing as a goal in its own right
when and where specific behavior change be require both in oneself and others these be to be affect through the use of specific technique
the range of behavioral strategy find in the literature of early buddhism be wide
when these be describe use modern terminology and list modern behavioral therapy manual these include fear reduction by graded exposure and reciprocal inhibition use reward for promote desirable behavior model for induce behavioral change the use of stimulus control to eliminate undesirable behavior the use of aversion to eliminate undesirable behavior training in social skill selfmonitoring control of intrusive thought by distraction switchingstopping incompatible thought and by prolonged exposure to them intense covert focus on the unpleasant aspect of a stimulus or the unpleasant consequence of a response to reduce attachment to the former and eliminate the latter graded approach to the development of positive feeling towards others use of external cue in behavior control use of response cost to aid elimination of undesirable behavior use of family member for carry out behavior change program and cognitivebehavioral method for example for grief
detail of these have be discuss in previous publication which also give reference to the original text de silva 
a full discussion here therefore to cite a example of this behavioral approach in buddhism and indicate its similarity to modern parallel
for the control of unwanted intrusive cognition which particularly hinder one s meditative effort and can therefore be a major problem for a buddhist several strategy be recommend
these be present in a hierarchical fashion each to be try if the preceding one fail
switch to a opposite or incompatible thought
the first be to reflect on a object which be associate with thought which be the opposite of the unwanted thought
this mean that if the unwanted cognition be associate with passion or lust one should think of something promote lustlessness if it be associate with malice one should think of something promote loving kindness and if it be something associate with delusion or confusion one should think of something promote clarity
this exercise of switch to a thought that be incompatible with the unwanted one like a carpenter get rid of a coarse peg with a fine one be claim to
if however the unwanted thought still keep arise one be advise to ponder on the peril and disadvantage of the thought that is to consider its harmful consequence
this would help one to rid oneself of the thought in question like in the case of a young man or woman who be eager to look nice and clean who would be revolted and disgusted if heshe find the carcass of a snake round hisher neck and would immediately get rid of it
ignore and distract
if that too fail the technique of ignore a unwanted thought be recommend
one be to strive not to pay attention like a man who close his eye or look in another direction in order not to see a visual object that he do not wish to see
it be suggest that various distracting activity may be use in order not to pay attention to the unwanted cognition
these include recalling of a doctrinal passage one have learn concentrate on actual
reflect on removal of cause
if the problem still persist then a far strategy be recommend this be to reflect on the removal or stop of the cause of the target thought
this be explain with the analogy of a man walk briskly who ask himself why be i walk briskly then reflect on his walking and stop and stand then reflect on his standing and sit down and so on
control with forceful effort
if this strategy too fail then a fifth method be advocate which be forcefully to restrain and dominate the mind
this use of effort be liken to a strong man hold and restrain a weak man one be to use the effort of one part of the mind to control the other
""
this account be base on the vitakkasanthana sutta of the majjhima nikaya and its commentary papancasudani
the similarity between some of these early buddhist strategy and the technique use for this and related thoughtstopping thoughtswitching distraction wolpe marks rachman hodgson and covert sensitization cautela be all foreshadow here
it will have be notice that the increasingly popular technique of habituation training that is instruct the client to expose himself to the thought repeatedly andor for prolonged period rachman be absent from this account
however a parallel of this in early buddhism be find in the satipattthana sutta also part of the majjhima nikaya and the mahasatipattthana sutta of the digha nikaya 
these discourse outline the important meditational technique of mindfulness which be refer to in a early section
mindfulness training be not simply a formal method of meditation but be a general selfimprovement skill with the person training himself to be aware of his body and bodily action of feeling and sensation and of thought and idea as they happen
in developing mindfulness or awareness one might be advise to be alert to all thought that arise including unwanted one
if a unwanted thought arise one be advise to face it directly and continuously to look straight into that thought and dwell on it
it be say that then gradually that thought will lose its intensity and will disappear gunaratna 
the similarity between this and the habituation training paradigm of presentday therapist need no comment
similar comparison can be make between most of the other behavioral strategy find in the buddhist text and those establish in present day behavior therapy for similar purpose de silva mikulas 
the significance of the presence of these technique in the buddhist text be manifold
firstly it reflect the fact that buddhism be not only concerned with one s endeavor to achieve the ultimate religious goal by a process of selfdevelopment as note early it also have something to offer in the area of daytoday management of behavioral problem often as a s own and one s fellow being benefit and happiness
thus these technique be applicable irrespective of whether one have commit oneself to a life devote to the aim of personal development and ultimately the state of arahanthood
secondly be clearly behavioral these be welldefined easy to use and above all empirically testable
indeed the buddhist approach be one of try out various strategy until one that be effective be find
as see above the vitakkasanthana sutta offer the disciple five different technique for deal with unwanted intrusive cognition each to be try if the preceding one fail to produce the desired result
the buddha s advice to the kalamas on the importance of not accept any view as hearsay authority and so forth but only on empirical ground reflect and embody this approach
indeed the buddha s own quest for enlightenment follow this path have try out various method and teaching available at the time he reject each of them as they fail path
thirdly the technique be for use on oneself as well as for influence the behavior of others numerous example be find for both type of use
relevance of buddhist behavioral change strategy
from a applied perspective the relevance of this aspect of buddhism be abundantly clear
a range of clearly define technique be available for use with common behavioral problem
the fact that they be similar to modern behavioral therapeutic technique in remarkable way have the implication that their validity and utility be already establish as many of the latter have be subject to rigorous clinical and experimental investigation
there be a strong case too for those buddhist strategy that so far have no counterpart in modern behavioral modification to be empirically test use clinical and experimental research method
if ground be then find for consider them clinically useful they can then be fruitfully incorporate into the repertoire of technique available to the present day therapist
it can also be argue that these technique will have particular relevance to the practice problem that arise in use method derive from western science with client population of a different cultural background be that the technique offer may seem alien to the indigenous population
thus they may not be readily accept or if accept the compliance with therapeutic instruction may be poor
these cultural difficulty in therapy and counseling have be fully recognize in recent year dardenne and mahtani draguns ward on the other hand if the technique that be use and offer although they may be a integral part of a western psychological system be show to be similar to idea and practice that be accept historically by the indigenous culture then they would have a great chance of gain compliance and success
how a behavioral therapy program be successfully devise for a hindu patient which include the hindu religious concept of karma yoga have be describe by singh and oberhummer 
similarly therapeutic package that include traditional zen practice have be use successfully with neurotic patient in that modern behavioral therapeutic strategy will be more readily acceptable to buddhist client group if their similarity with those find in the early buddhist literature and the use of the same or similar technique by the buddha and his early disciple be highlight
the use of meditation technique as a stressreduction strategy with buddhist group in several place provide a example of this phenomenon
a case in point in the use of buddhist meditation in a psychiatric setting in kandy sri lanka de silva samarasinghe 
mikulas have comment on the favorable reception accord to the idea and technique of behavior modification in another buddhist country thailand
a far possible application of buddhist psychology for therapeutic purpose lie in the area of prophylaxis
theoretically there be much scope for this both with buddhist client group and with others
several buddhist technique appear to have a potential role to play in the prevention of certain kind of psychological disorder
for example train in meditation lead to great ability to tolerance of the numerous inevitable stress in modern life
one may in other word achieve a degree of immunity against the psychological effect of stress and frustration stress inoculation training of meichenbaum 
the facility and skill in selfmonitoring one can acquire with the aid of mindfulness meditation could provide a valuable mean of selfcontrol
the role of selfmonitoring in the selfregulation of behavior be welldocumented kazdin 
the overall selfdevelopment that buddhism encourage and recommend also have something to offer for prophylactic purpose
for example if one train oneself not to develop intense attachment to material thing and to those around one one be less likely to be vulnerable to psychological distress and disorder arise from their loss including abnormal and debilitating grief reaction
this be not to suggest that the total renunciation of all worldly comfort and attachment should be the goal of every person
indeed very few person in today s world will want to renounce all material thing and devote themselves to the attainment of personal perfection
would remain lay person with normal household duty and daytoday activity and pursuit and that only a relatively small number would renounce lay life completely hence the prominence give in buddhism to lay ethics gombrich saddhatissa 
on the other hand some of the meditation exercise and other personal development endeavor find in buddhism can potentially enable a person to develop a outlook on life and pattern of response which in turn will help cope with the problem of living by enable great calmness and assurance and with reduced vulnerability to common psychological disorder
this kind of primary prevention be certainly worth explore
buddhism and modern western psychology
finally a few comment may be make on the relationship between modern western psychology on the one hand and buddhist psychology on the other
the relationship between the scientific psychology of the west and indigenous system of psychology can take many form range from totally independent existence to complete integration katz 
buddhist psychology be so only in the narrow sense in that it develop prior to and outside the context of modern western science
it offer clearly testable hypothesis and therefore can be bring within the realm of scientific inquiry
far as note above the overall stance of buddhism be a eminently empiricist one and the process of evaluate the notion and practice of its psychology be something that will be consistent with this stance
such testing will not be alien to the spirit of buddhism which encourage enquiry and discourage dogmatic acceptance of theory and claim jayatilleke 
thus buddhist psychology can potentially make a contribution to modern scientific psychology without compromise its basic stance or that of the latter
what be the chance of the successful integration of the two in the author s view total integration between two independently developed system of psychology each quite sophisticated do not seem to be either feasible or desirable
modern scientific psychology will continue to evolve and grow and in the process it source for evaluation and where the evaluation have lead to positive result incorporation
buddhist psychology will continue to be one of the indigenous psychology that will provide many such testable concept and technique and thus make a contribution towards the far expansion and development of modern psychology
beyond such interaction and influence it be not plausible to assume that the two system in their entirety will be or can be integrate
on the other hand it be possible to envisage that a limited integration between certain aspect of buddhist psychology and certain parallel area of modern psychology may fruitfully be affect
mikulas for example have argue for a integrated new system of behavior and behavior change of which both buddhism and behavior modification be subset
within the broad limit of psychology it be indeed possible that such school or area of modern psychology which be able to derive much from or have much in common with buddhist psychology may develop and fiuorish with such close interaction
there be a good deal of buddhism and other idea of personal development and enduring personal change
on this limited scale close overlap and synthesis seem possible
in the broad context buddhist psychology be likely to keep interact with modern psychology rather than achieve integration with it
in this interaction it will continue to make a contribution to both theory and practice in different area and in varying degree of significance
this contribution be likely to be particularly significant in the area of psychological therapy
this study describe the development of the depression proneness rating scale dprs a brief selfadministered measure of the tendency to experience frequent longlasting and severe depression and three investigation into the scale s reliability validity and factor structure
study use university student
find a stability coefficient of for the dprs over a testretest interval of nine week
far time t dprs score predict time t symptom of depression even after adjust for time symptom xxr change 
study use university student find the dprs to be a better predictor of past depressive episode xxr to than be the beck depression inventory xxr 
study use university student find that all item of the dprs load or great on a single factor for both male and female
overall result provide substantial evidence for the dprs as a valid depression proneness refer to the tendency to experience relatively frequent longlasting and severe depression
researcher interested in uncover the determinant of depression proneness have typically use one of three correlational design correlate the hypothesized determinant with current severity of depression all measure obtain in a single setting correlate the hypothesized determinant measure at time with a measure of depression obtain on some later occasion or correlate the hypothesized determinant with the subject past history of depression
a example of the first approach be a study conduct by seligman abramson semmel von baeyer 
as predict by the learnedhelplessness model depressed student make more internal stable and global attribution for bad outcome than do nondepressed student suggest that attributional style may be contribute to depression proneness
of course a major shortcoming of this type of design be that one can not rule out the equally plausible proposition that attributional style be a consequence rather than a cause of depression coyne gotlib of a individual s current affective state with his or her tendency to become depressed
although it be reasonable to expect that depression proneness would correlate with a individual s current affective state this relationship be far from perfect
not everyone who be depression prone will be depressed during the assessment period and not everyone who be depressed will be equally depression prone
klerman for example find that only of those diagnose as neurotic depressive ever experience another depressive episode during a fouryear followup
a example of the second approach be a study by metalsky halberstadt and abramson 
these author find that measure of attributional style take before a important exam time do not predict depressive mood in college student who have just receive a unsatisfactory grade on their midterm exam time but do predict depressive mood in these student two day later time 
a major advantage of this approach over the first be that by adjust for the effect of a significant correlation between the hypothesized determinant of depression proneness attributional style at time and depression at time xxn can be consider consistent with the proposition that attributional style predispose to depression and inconsistent with the proposition that attributional style be merely a consequence of depression
however other problem remain
in use the subject s affective state at time xxn as a indicant of depression proneness the researcher be in effect make a inference about the subject s tendency to become depressed base on a single observation and as epstein have demonstrate inference regarding behavioral tendency that be base on single observation be apt to be high in measurement error and low in temporal reliability or replicability
the metalsky et al
 result provide a excellent illustration of this point
if mood have be assess at time t but not time t the attributional style hypothesis would have be fully support
conversely if mood have be assess at t but not t a example of the third approach be a study by silverman silverman and eardly 
these investigator assess dysfunctional attitude in patient with a history of depression when they be symptomatic and again when they be in remission
the logic behind this design be that if dysfunctional attitude exhibit by the symptomatic depressive be still present when the symptom of depression have remit then these attitude qualify as possible determinant of depressive vulnerability rather than as correlate or consequence of the depressive episode itself
however certain aspect of this approach can be problematic
as lewinsohn zeiss and duncan have note study of patient population be potentially bias by factor relate to helpseeking behavior and treatment
most depressed individual do not seek or receive treatment roberts vernon weissman myers thompson and those who be treat be likely to be suffer from more severe form of the disorder davies blashki 
there be also the possible confounding of psychotropic medication that be typically prescribe for the remitted patient in these investigation simons garfield murphy 
another problem appear to be obtain reliable diagnosis of depression
some study corer wittenborn silverman silverman eardley report select their subject according to the research diagnostic criteria rdc or the diagnostic and statistical manual dsmii dsmiii but do not provide information about the training or interrater reliability of the interviewer make the diagnosis
yet another problem with this approach involve dichotomize individual as depression prone or not depression prone on the basis of whether they have ever receive a psychiatric diagnosis of depression
it would seem more appropriate to consider depression proneness to be a continuous variable and to develop more sensitive and stable measure of this variable
lastly many researcher who want to investigate vulnerability factor or risk factor in depression can not use this approach because they simply do not have access to sufficiently large number of formerly depressed patient
many if researcher have access to a psychometrically sound and economical measure of depression proneness
to this end zemore have develop a measure of depression proneness that do not rely on current severity of symptom or past diagnosis of depression
instead respondent be ask to indicate the extent to which they experience a variety of depressotypic symptom over the past two year
assume that each subject s report be base on multiple observation of his or her affective reaction to a variety of situation over the past two year these selfreport should provide more direct more sensitive and more reliable measure of depression proneness than those use in past investigation
additional advantage of this approach over some of those previously discuss be the ability to treat depression proneness as a continuous variable the ability to assess large number of individual quickly and economically the ability to assess a variety of nonpatient population and when use in conjunction with measure of current affective state the ability to statistically control partial out the influence of and other situational or personal variable of interest
the depression proneness rating scale dprs be develop by zemore and zemore bretell to assess a individual s tendency to become depressed the dprs have three question compare to most people you know how often do you get depressed compare to most people you know how long do your depression last compare to most people you know how deeply depressed do you become
each question be accompany by a point scale anchor at one end by the descriptor much less often much short or much less deeply and at the other end by the descriptor much more often much long or much more deeply
the midpoint of the scale be describe as about the same
the dprs list ten of the most commonly assess symptom of depression and ask the respondent to rate how frequently compare to others he or she have experience these symptom over the past two year
at one end by much less often and at the other by much more often
the midpoint be describe as about the same
zemore report that student score on the dprs and a early version of the dprs be significantly correlate with depressionproneness rating give them by their parent and peer xxr 
the dprs have also be report to correlate negatively with interpersonal problemsolving skill xxr to zemore dell 
more recent study have combine the dprs and the dprs into a single item scale refer to as simply the dprs
use a point scale for each item total score on the dprs can range from to with high score indicate great vulnerability to depression
zemore and rinholm report coefficient alpha estimate of reliability for male and female of and respectively
these author also find that dprs score correlate with offspring report of parental rejection and overcontrol independent of the similarly clair and genest find child of alcoholic father score significantly high on the dprs than child whose parent be nonalcoholic
zemore and bretell find that the dprs correlate substantially with three personality measure that have previously be find to discriminate between remitted formerly depressed woman and woman with no psychiatric history xxr to 
zemore and veikle find the dprs to correlate with the beck depression inventory xxr with lubin s depression adjective checklist xxr and with weissman s dysfunctional attitude scale xxr 
the relationship between dysfunctional attitude and depression proneness remain significant even after control for currentlevel depression
thus evidence for the reliability and validity of the dprs be accumulate
several question remain with regard to the psychometric property of the dprs
the present paper report on three investigation that be design to address some of these question
study assess the stability of dprs score and their ability to predict between subject dprs score and index of clinical depression and study investigate the factor structure of the dprs
subject in all three study be university undergraduate
most be enroll in introductory psychology course at the time of the study
participation be voluntary no external inducement such as course credit or money be offer
all subject be debrief immediately follow their participation in the study
study 
if the dprs measure a individual s tendency to become depressed then respondent score on the dprs should be relatively stable over time and score on the dprs should predict future symptom of depression
method
one hundred man and woman undergraduate complete the dprs and the short form of the beck depression inventory bdi both before and after the christmas holiday
the testretest interval be approximately nine week long
the bdi be one of the most wellvalidated and commonly used measure of current severity of depression bumberry oliver mcclure 
the short form consist of thirteen item from
high score indicate great symptom severity
beck rial and rickels report correlation of and between the long and the short form of the bdi for group of schizophrenic patient and suicideattempters respectively result and discussion
our hypothesis that the dprs score would show relatively high testretest stability be confirm
dprs score at time be highly correlate with dprs score at time nine week later r xxp lt 
as expect current severity of depression show less stability with bdi score at time only moderately correlate with bdi score at time r xxp lt 
the difference between these two stability coefficient be statistically significant z xxp lt 
thus the great temporal stability of the dprs relative to the bdi be consistent with our assumption that respondent be able to consistently assess their depressive tendency and that these judgment be to some degree independent of the respondent s current affective state
depression be also confirm
a hierarchical multiple regression analysis find that time dprs score account for a significant increase in explained variance in time bdi score beyond that explain by time bdi score xxr change f xxp lt 
we should point out however that our measure of future symptom of depression be base on a single observation time bdi score and as mention early a single observation be not a reliable indicator of how a individual characteristically behave epstein 
a better test of our hypothesis would have be to correlate dprs score with the incidence of depressive symptom at several point in time and in a variety of situation
study 
if the dprs be a valid measure of depression proneness then subject who score high on this measure should be more likely to have a history of depression than subject who score low
method
to test the above hypothesis university student complete the dprs the ask about past episode of depression have you ever be treat for depression by a psychologist psychiatrist or other professional counsellor have you ever attempt suicide have you ever have a depression for which medication be prescribe have you ever be hospitalize for depression
each of these item be answer on a point scale never once twice three or more time 
of the respondent report be treat for depression by a professional counsellor have attempt suicide have a depression for which medication have be prescribe and have be hospitalize for depression
student who fall into any of the above category be classify as have a history of depression xxn 
the remaining student be classify as have no history of depression xxn 
result and discussion
our hypothesis that the dprs would discriminate between correlation between history of depression present vs absent and dprs score xxr xxp lt 
the relationship between history of depression and bdi score be also significant xxr xxp lt but significantly small than the correlation between history of depression and dprs score t for the significance of the difference between dependent correlation xxp lt 
thus the dprs be find to be a better predictor of past depression than the bdi as would be expect if the dprs measure depression proneness and the bdi measure current severity of depression
it should be point out that because the dprs be normally distribute and the incidence of past depression be highly skew the maximum possible value of xxr be severely restrict
if a nonlinear transformation be use to skew the distribution of dprs score so that the dprs distribution more closely resemble the historyofdepression distribution then the linear relationship between these two variable be increase
for example square dprs score skew past depression from to 
before leave this section we should mention that both the dprs and the historyofdepression measure be base on the subject s selfreport
consequently we can not rule out the possibility that the observed relationship between the dprs and history of depression be due at least in part to common method variance
future research will have to develop more adequate measure of past depressive episode independent of subject selfreport in order to better assess the predictive validity of the dprs
study 
another question that need to be address regard the dimensionality of the dprs
according to nunnally item within a measure be useful only to the extent that they share a common core the attribute which be to be measure
in sum item score to arrive at a total score it be assume that each item add something to the others and unless the item share a
attribute it would not be meaningful to sum score over item
thus item which have a high average correlation with total score and be dominate by one factor only nunnally xxp 
the purpose of the third study be to determine the extent to which dprs achieve this ideal
method
subject be male and female undergraduate
approximately half of the subject complete the dprs outside of class in small group of five to fifteen
the remaining subject complete the questionnaire during class time in group of 
result and discussion
cronbach s coefficient alpha estimate of the scale reliability be 
correlation between each item and total score minus the item be correlate with the total score range from to with a mean of 
the magnitude of these itemtotal correlation suggest the presence of a single common factor
however for a more definitive assessment of the latent structure underlie the dprs the matrix of item intercorrelation be factoranalyzed use principalfactor extraction with multiple xxr as initial communality estimate
only one analysis
the scree test cattell also indicate a single factor solution the eigenvalue for the first factor be more than eight time that of the second factor vs 
factor i account for of the total variance
table present the item loading for this factor
note that all item load or great
analysis for male and female independently produce identical factor structure
for male the eigenvalue for the first and second factor be and respectively
for female the eigenvalue for the first and second factor be and respectively
in total the result show that the dprs be unidimensional
a single score represent depression proneness therefore can be obtain by sum over all of the item
result hold for both male and female
far research however be need to replicate the factor structure of the dprs with population other than university student
conclusion
the result of the three study report here together with for the validity of the dprs as a unidimensional measure of depression proneness
consistent with the concept of depression proneness score on the dprs be relatively stable over time predict symptom of depression at time independent of symptom of depression at time and be correlate with past index of depression
the dprs be also show to be dominate by a single factor with identical factor structure for both male and female
thus the dprs appear to be a accurate and practical mean of assess depression proneness
however additional validation study should be conduct use more adequate criteria measure to assess the predictive validity of the dprs and sample population other than university student

a recent study by buckhalt and jensen make a important contribution in this area by factor analyze twelve parameter of reaction time and show that three independent factor be present
they identify these as movement time reaction time ie speed of apprehension or decision time and variability of reaction time
the isolation of a variability factor support the contention that variability be a distinct component of performance on reaction time task independent of reaction time as such and movement time
it be consider that the buckhalt and jensen result be sufficiently important to justify a attempt at replication and this be the first objective of the study to be report in this paper
the second objective of the study be to examine the relationship between reaction time and the six major primary ability originally identify by thurstone consist of reasoning verbal comprehension spatial numerical and perceptual speed and fluency ability
hitherto study of the a general reasoning test of which raven s progressive matrix have be the most commonly use
it be possible that some of the component of reaction time might be a function of one or more of the established primary mental ability rather than of general intelligence spearman s g
the most obvious hypothesis be that perceptual speed primarily be involved in reaction time task
we do not believe that this question have be investigate as yet
method
the subject be child boy and girl attend primary school in small country town and village in northern ireland
all the nineyearold in the school be test
the mean age be month standard deviation 
the primary mental ability test for grade thurstone be administer
this consist of five subtests that measure reasoning verbal numerical spatial and perceptual speed ability
the test do not contain thurstone s sixth major primary of fluency
hence two fluency test be give
these be to write two minute be allow for each test and be score for the number of acceptable word give incorrect spelling be accept
raven s standard progressive matrix and cattell s culture fair test scale form a be also give to provide generally recognize test of general intelligence or spearman s g
in cattell s terminology the culture fair test be a measure of fluid intelligence
the reaction time be record with a apparatus describe by jensen and munro 
it consist of a black metal box with the top side pitch at a degree angle
on the top surface of the box be a cm radius semicircle of eight plastic inch microswitch pushbutton which be light from underneath
at the center of the semicircle nearest the subject be a black home button
press the home button activate each trial which be program and time by a apricot microcomputer
subject s data be record automatically on the working disk immediately after each trial
the apparatus stimulus light and release of the home button and movement time time between the release of the home button and depression of the response button
the consistency of response for reaction time and movement time be also measure as the standard deviation of response across trial
three condition be employ in the reaction time experiment
in the first condition simple reaction time be measure
only one of the light be employ and the others be mask
sixteen trial be give precede by three practice trial far practice may be give if necessary
in the second condition choice reaction time be measure
all eight light be employ
at each of the trial three practice trial one of the light come on at random
the third condition involve the use of the oddmanout paradigm which be introduce by frearson and eysenck 
thirty oddmanout trial six practice trial be present in two block of trial with a rest of approximately one minute between them
button illuminate simultaneously and the subject be ask to press the button which be far away from the other two ie the oddmanout
after the third condition another trial of the second condition be give
when error occur due to subject press the wrong button the trial be repeat at the end of the block of trial in that condition
if error recur on repetition the trial be repeat until the correct response be make
in the first and second condition trial be log as error where the rt be less than msec or great than msec or where the mt be less than msec and great than msec
in the third condition trial be log as error where the rt be less than msec or great than msec and where the mt be less than msec and great than msec
the following five measure be obtain from the reaction time trial movement time simple reaction time complex bit reaction time by the standard deviation
median time be take rather than mean to reduce distort effect of exceptionally fast or slow time
result
descriptive statistics give mean and standard deviation for all the reaction time measure be give in table 
the first six variable be the mean median mm
each subject s median be obtain and the figure enter in the table be the mean of the median
the second six variable be the intraindividual variation iv and consist of the standard deviation of the median
the effect size be the sex difference express in standard deviation unit use the standard deviation for the entire sample
thus the large sex difference be in movement time in the simple reaction time task the figure d indicate that the mean of boy be faster than that of girl by of a standard deviation
this be the only statistically significant sex difference
we believe that a difference of this kind have not hitherto be obtain most study have not report sex difference deviation for the intelligence test be set out in table
